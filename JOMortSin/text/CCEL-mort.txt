                                Prefatory note.

   It sheds interesting light on the character and resources of Owen, if
   the circumstances in which the following treatise was composed are
   borne in mind. It was published in 1656, and its author was at the time
   Dean of Christ Church and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford,
   restoring it, by a course of mingled kindliness and decision, from the
   ruinous condition into which it had lapsed during the civil wars, and
   raising it to such prosperity as to extort the praises of Clarendon. He
   was preaching, each alternate Sabbath, those sermons which lingered in
   the memory and strengthened the piety of Philip Henry. He was
   frequently summoned to London on momentous consultations respecting
   public affairs, and to preach before the Parliament. As if this amount
   of toil were not sufficient to occupy him, -- toil so great that, in
   his noble address on resigning the vice-chancellorship of the
   University, he describes himself as having been "saepius morti
   proximus" -- the Council of State had imposed on him the task of
   replying to Biddle the Socinian; and he fulfilled it by the production
   of his elaborate and masterly work, "Vindiciae Evangelicae," -- a
   bulwark of the faith, so solid in its foundation, and so massy in its
   proportions, that the entire phalanx of Socinian authorship has shrunk
   from the attempt to assail it. In the next year, and but a few months
   after this great work had appeared, as if his secular labours in the
   management of the University, his own heavy share in the burden of
   public affairs, and the rough duties of controversy, could not arrest
   the progress of grace in his own soul, or deaden his zeal for the
   promotion of vital godliness around him, he gave to the world this
   treatise, "On the Mortification of Sin in Believers."

   We learn from the preface, that it embodies what he had preached with
   such acceptance that "sundry persons, in whose hearts are the ways of
   God," pressed him to publish it. He had a desire also to correct
   certain "dangerous mistakes" into which some preachers or writers of
   that day had fallen, who recommended and enforced a process of
   mortifying sin which was not conducted on evangelical principles, and
   only tended to ensnare the conscience, and foster self-righteousness
   and superstition. The directions which our author gives in order to
   subdue the power of internal corruption are at the farthest remove from
   all the arts and practices of a hollow asceticism. There is no trace in
   this work of the morbid and dreamy tone of kindred treatises, which
   have emerged from a life of cloistered seclusion. Our author's
   knowledge of human nature, in its real elements, and as it appears in
   the wide arena of life, is only surpassed by his acquaintance with the
   truths of the Word, and their bearing on the experience and workings of
   every heart. The reader is made to feel, above all things, that the
   only cross on which he can nail his every lust to its utter
   destruction, is, not the devices of a self-inflicted maceration, but
   the tree on which Christ hung, made a curse for us.

   After an analysis and explanation of the passage in Scripture (Rom.
   viii. 13) on which the treatise is based, some general principles are
   deduced and expounded. What follows is designed -- first, to show
   wherein the real mortification of sin consists; secondly, to assign
   general directions, without which no sin can be spiritually mortified;
   and, lastly, to unfold at length and in detail specific and particular
   directions for this important spiritual exercise.

   The treatise has been so much a favourite, that it passed through
   several editions in the author's lifetime. It is given here as
   corrected and enlarged in the second edition (1658), though by some
   oversight modern reprints of it have been always taken from the first.
   The estimate of its value indicated by the number of the early
   editions, is confirmed by the circumstance, that it has since obtained
   the especial recommendation of Mr. Wilberforce. (See his "Practical
   View," etc. p. 392.) -- Ed.

                                    Preface.

   Christian Reader,

   I shall in a few words acquaint thee with the reasons that obtained my
   consent to the publishing of the ensuing discourse. The consideration
   of the present state and condition of the generality of professors, the
   visible evidences of the frame of their hearts and spirits, manifesting
   a great disability of dealing with the temptations wherewith, from the
   peace they have in the world and the divisions that they have among
   themselves, they are encompassed, holds the chief place amongst them.
   This I am assured is of so great importance, that if hereby I only
   occasion others to press more effectually on the consciences of men the
   work of considering their ways, and to give more clear direction for
   the compassing of the end proposed, I shall well esteem of my lot in
   this undertaking. This was seconded by an observation of some men's
   dangerous mistakes, who of late days have taken upon them to give
   directions for the mortification of sin, who, being unacquainted with
   the mystery of the gospel and the efficacy of the death of Christ, have
   anew imposed the yoke of a self-wrought-out mortification on the necks
   of their disciples, which neither they nor their forefathers were ever
   able to bear. A mortification they cry up and press, suitable to that
   of the gospel neither in respect of nature, subject, causes, means, nor
   effects; which constantly produces the deplorable issues of
   superstition, self-righteousness, and anxiety of conscience in them who
   take up the burden which is so bound for them.

   What is here proposed in weakness, I humbly hope will answer the spirit
   and letter of the gospel, with the experiences of them who know what it
   is to walk with God, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace.
   So that if not this, yet certainly something of this kind, is very
   necessary at this season for the promotion and furtherance of this work
   of gospel mortification in the hearts of believers, and their direction
   in paths safe, and wherein they may find rest to their souls. Something
   I have to add as to what in particular relates unto myself. Having
   preached on this subject unto some comfortable success, through the
   grace of Him that administereth seed to the sower, I was pressed by
   sundry persons, in whose hearts are the ways of God, thus to publish
   what I had delivered, with such additions and alterations as I should
   judge necessary. Under the inducement of their desires, I called to
   remembrance the debt, wherein I have now for some years stood engaged
   unto sundry noble and worthy Christian friends, as to a treatise of
   Communion with God, some while since promised to them; [1] and thereon
   apprehended, that if I could not hereby compound for the greater debt,
   yet I might possibly tender them this discourse of variance with
   themselves, as interest for their forbearance of that of peace and
   communion with God. Besides, I considered that I had been
   providentially engaged in the public debate of sundry controversies in
   religion, which might seem to claim something in another kind of more
   general use, as a fruit of choice, not necessity. On these and the like
   accounts is this short discourse brought forth to public view, and now
   presented unto thee. I hope I may own in sincerity, that my heart's
   desire unto God, and the chief design of my life in the station wherein
   the good providence of God hath placed me, are, that mortification and
   universal holiness may be promoted in my own and in the hearts and ways
   of others, to the glory of God; that so the gospel of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ may be adorned in all things: for the compassing
   of which end, if this little discourse (of the publishing whereof this
   is the sum of the account I shall give) may in any thing be useful to
   the least of the saints, it will be looked on as a return of the weak
   prayers wherewith it is attended by its unworthy author,

   John Owen.

   published.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                   Chapter I.

   The foundation of the whole ensuing discourse laid in Rom. viii. 13 --
   The words of the apostle opened -- The certain connection between true
   mortification and salvation -- Mortification the work of believers --
   The Spirit the principal efficient cause of it -- What meant by "the
   body" in the words of the apostle -- What by "the deeds of the body" --
   Life, in what sense promised to this duty.

   That what I have of direction to contribute to the carrying on of the
   work of mortification in believers may receive order and perspicuity, I
   shall lay the foundation of it in those words of the apostle, Rom.
   viii. 13, "If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye
   shall live;" and reduce the whole to an improvement of the great
   evangelical truth and mystery contained in them.

   The apostle having made a recapitulation of his doctrine of
   justification by faith, and the blessed estate and condition of them
   who are made by grace partakers thereof, verses 1-3 of this chapter,
   proceeds to improve it to the holiness and consolation of believers.

   Among his arguments and motives unto holiness, the verse mentioned
   containeth one from the contrary events and effects of holiness and
   sin: "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die." What it is to "live
   after the flesh," and what it is to "die," that being not my present
   aim and business, I shall no otherwise explain than as they will fall
   in with the sense of the latter words of the verse, as before proposed.

   In the words peculiarly designed for the foundation of the ensuing
   discourse, there is, --

   First, A duty prescribed: "Mortify the deeds of the body."

   Secondly, The persons are denoted to whom it is prescribed: "Ye," --
   "if ye mortify."

   Thirdly, There is in them a promise annexed to that duty: "Ye shall
   live."

   Fourthly, The cause or means of the performance of this duty, -- the
   Spirit: "If ye through the Spirit."

   Fifthly, The conditionality of the whole proposition, wherein duty,
   means, and promise are contained: "If ye," etc.

   1. The first thing occurring in the words as they lie in the entire
   proposition is the conditional note, Ei de, "But if." Conditionals in
   such propositions may denote two things:--

   (1.) The uncertainty of the event or thing promised, in respect of them
   to whom the duty is prescribed. And this takes place where the
   condition is absolutely necessary unto the issue, and depends not
   itself on any determinate cause known to him to whom it is prescribed.
   So we say, "If we live, we will do such a thing." This cannot be the
   intendment of the conditional expression in this place. Of the persons
   to whom these words are spoken, it is said, verse 1 of the same
   chapter, "There is no condemnation to them."

   (2.) The certainty of the coherence and connection that is between the
   things spoken of; as we say to a sick man, "If you will take such a
   potion, or use such a remedy, you will be well." The thing we solely
   intend to express is the certainty of the connection that is between
   the potion or remedy and health. And this is the use of it here. The
   certain connection that is between the mortifying of the deeds of the
   body and living is intimated in this conditional particle.

   Now, the connection and coherence of things being manifold, as of cause
   and effect, of way and means and the end, this between mortification
   and life is not of cause and effect properly and strictly, -- for
   "eternal life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ," Rom. vi. 23, --
   but of means and end. God hath appointed this means for the attaining
   that end, which he hath freely promised. Means, though necessary, have
   a fair subordination to an end of free promise. A gift, and procuring
   cause in him to whom it is given, are inconsistent. The intendment,
   then, of this proposition as conditional is, that there is a certain
   infallible connection and coherence between true mortification and
   eternal life: if you use this means, you shall obtain that end; if you
   do mortify, you shall live. And herein lies the main motive unto and
   enforcement of the duty prescribed.

   2. The next thing we meet withal in the words is the persons to whom
   this duty is prescribed, and that is expressed in the word "Ye," in the
   original included in the verb, thanatoute "if ye mortify;" -- that is,
   ye believers; ye to whom "there is no condemnation," verse 1; ye that
   are "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit," verse 9; who are "quickened
   by the Spirit of Christ," verses 10, 11; to you is this duty
   prescribed. The pressing of this duty immediately on any other is a
   notable fruit of that superstition and self-righteousness that the
   world is full of, -- the great work and design of devout men ignorant
   of the gospel, Rom. x. 3, 4; John xv. 5. Now, this description of the
   persons, in conjunction with the prescription of the duty, is the main
   foundation of the ensuing discourse, as it lies in this thesis or
   proposition:--

   The choicest believers, who are assuredly freed from the condemning
   power of sin, ought yet to make it their business all their days to
   mortify the indwelling power of sin.

   3. The principal efficient cause of the performance of this duty is the
   Spirit: Ei de Pneumati, -- " If by the Spirit." The Spirit here is the
   Spirit mentioned verse 11, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God,
   that "dwells in us," verse 9, that "quickens us," verse 11; "the Holy
   Ghost," verse 14; [2] the "Spirit of adoption," verse 15; the Spirit
   "that maketh intercession for us," verse 26. All other ways of
   mortification are vain, all helps leave us helpless; it must be done by
   the Spirit. Men, as the apostle intimates, Rom. ix. 30-32, may attempt
   this work on other principles, by means and advantages administered on
   other accounts, as they always have done, and do: but, saith he, "This
   is the work of the Spirit; by him alone is it to be wrought, and by no
   other power is it to be brought about." Mortification from a
   self-strength, carried on by ways of self-invention, unto the end of a
   self-righteousness, is the soul and substance of all false religion in
   the world. And this is a second principle of my ensuing discourse.

   4. The duty itself, "Mortify the deeds of the body," is nextly to be
   remarked.

   Three things are here to be inquired into:-- (1.) What is meant by the
   body; (2.) What by the deeds of the body; (3.) What by mortifying of
   them.

   (1.) The body in the close of the verse is the same with the flesh in
   the beginning: "If ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye ...
   mortify the deeds of the body," -- that is, of the flesh. It is that
   which the apostle hath all along discoursed of under the name of the
   flesh; which is evident from the prosecution of the antithesis between
   the Spirit and the flesh, before and after. The body, then, here is
   taken for that corruption and depravity of our natures whereof the
   body, in a great part, is the seat and instrument, the very members of
   the body being made servants unto unrighteousness thereby, Rom. vi. 19.
   It is indwelling sin, the corrupted flesh or lust, that is intended.
   Many reasons might be given of this metonymical expression, that I
   shall not now insist on. The "body" here is the same with palaios
   anthropos, and soma tes hamartias, the "old man," and the "body of
   sin," Rom. vi. 6; or it may synecdochically express the whole person
   considered as corrupted, and the seat of lusts and distempered
   affections.

   (2.) The deeds of the body. The word is praxeis, which, indeed,
   denoteth the outward actions chiefly, "the works of the flesh," as they
   are called, ta erga tes sarkos, Gal. v. 19; which are there said to be
   "manifest," and are enumerated. Now, though the outward deeds are here
   only expressed, yet the inward and next causes are chiefly intended;
   the "axe is to be laid to the root of the tree," -- the deeds of the
   flesh are to be mortified in their causes, from whence they spring. The
   apostle calls them deeds, as that which every lust tends unto; though
   it do but conceive and prove abortive, it aims to bring forth a perfect
   sin.

   Having, both in the seventh and the beginning of this chapter, treated
   of indwelling lust and sin as the fountain and principle of all sinful
   actions, he here mentions its destruction under the name of the effects
   which it doth produce. Praxeis tou somatos are, as much as phronema tes
   sarkos, Rom. viii. 6, the "wisdom of the flesh," by a metonymy of the
   same nature with the former; or as the pathemata and epithumiai, the
   "passions and lusts of the flesh," Gal. v. 24, whence the deeds and
   fruits of it do arise; and in this sense is the body used, Rom. viii.
   10: "The body is dead because of sin."

   (3.) To mortify. Ei thanatoute, -- "If ye put to death;" a metaphorical
   expression, taken from the putting of any living thing to death. To
   kill a man, or any other living thing, is to take away the principle of
   all his strength, vigour, and power, so that he cannot act or exert, or
   put forth any proper actings of his own; so it is in this case.
   Indwelling sin is compared to a person, a living person, called "the
   old man," with his faculties, and properties, his wisdom, craft,
   subtlety, strength; this, says the apostle, must be killed, put to
   death, mortified, -- that is, have its power, life, vigour, and
   strength, to produce its effects, taken away by the Spirit. It is,
   indeed, meritoriously, and by way of example, utterly mortified and
   slain by the cross of Christ; and the "old man" is thence said to be
   "crucified with Christ," Rom. vi. 6, and ourselves to be "dead" with
   him, verse 8, and really initially in regeneration, Rom. vi. 3-5, when
   a principle contrary to it, and destructive of it, Gal. v. 17, is
   planted in our hearts; but the whole work is by degrees to be carried
   on towards perfection all our days. Of this more in the process of our
   discourse. The intendment of the apostle in this prescription of the
   duty mentioned is, -- that the mortification of indwelling sin
   remaining in our mortal bodies, that it may not have life and power to
   bring forth the works or deeds of the flesh is the constant duty of
   believers.

   5. The promise unto this duty is life: "Ye shall live." The life
   promised is opposed to the death threatened in the clause foregoing,
   "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die;" which the same apostle
   expresseth, "Ye shall of the flesh reap corruption," Gal. vi. 8, or
   destruction from God. Now, perhaps the word may not only intend eternal
   life, but also the spiritual life in Christ, which here we have; not as
   to the essence and being of it, which is already enjoyed by believers,
   but as to the joy, comfort, and vigour of it: as the apostle says in
   another case, "Now I live, if ye stand fast," 1 Thess. iii. 8; -- "Now
   my life will do me good; I shall have joy and comfort with my life;" --
   "Ye shall live, lead a good, vigorous, comfortable, spiritual life
   whilst you are here, and obtain eternal life hereafter."

   Supposing what was said before of the connection between mortification
   and eternal life, as of means and end, I shall add only, as a second
   motive to the duty prescribed, that, --

   The vigour, and power, and comfort of our spiritual life depends on the
   mortification of the deeds of the flesh.

                                  Chapter II.

   The principal assertion concerning the necessity of mortification
   proposed to confirmation -- Mortification the duty of the best
   believers, Col. iii. 5; 1 Cor. ix. 27 -- Indwelling sin always abides;
   no perfection in this life, Phil. iii. 12; 1 Cor. xiii. 12; 2 Pet. iii.
   18; Gal. v. 17, etc. -- The activity of abiding sin in believers, Rom.
   vii. 23; James iv. 5; Heb. xii. 1 -- Its fruitfulness and tendency --
   Every lust aims at the height in its kind -- The Spirit and new nature
   given to contend against indwelling sin, Gal. v. 17; 2 Pet. i. 4, 5;
   Rom. vii. 23 -- The fearful issue of the neglect of mortification, Rev.
   iii. 2; Heb. iii. 13 -- The first general principle of the whole
   discourse hence confirmed -- Want of this duty lamented.

   Having laid this foundation, a brief confirmation of the fore-mentioned
   principal deductions will lead me to what I chiefly intend, --

   I. That the choicest believers, who are assuredly freed from the
   condemning power of sin, ought yet to make it their business all their
   days to mortify the indwelling power of sin.

   So the apostle, Col. iii. 5, "Mortify therefore your members which are
   upon the earth." Whom speaks he to? Such as were "risen with Christ,"
   verse 1; such as were "dead" with him, verse 3; such as whose life
   Christ was, and who should "appear with him in glory," verse 4. Do you
   mortify; do you make it your daily work; be always at it whilst you
   live; cease not a day from this work; be killing sin or it will be
   killing you. Your being dead with Christ virtually, your being
   quickened with him, will not excuse you from this work. And our Saviour
   tells us how his Father deals with every branch in him that beareth
   fruit, every true and living branch. "He purgeth it, that it may bring
   forth more fruit," John xv. 2. He prunes it, and that not for a day or
   two, but whilst it is a branch in this world. And the apostle tells you
   what was his practice, 1 Cor. ix. 27, "I keep under my body, and bring
   it into subjection." "I do it," saith he, "daily; it is the work of my
   life: I omit it not; this is my business." And if this were the work
   and business of Paul, who was so incomparably exalted in grace,
   revelations, enjoyments, privileges, consolations, above the ordinary
   measure of believers, where may we possibly bottom an exemption from
   this work and duty whilst we are in this world? Some brief account of
   the reasons hereof may be given:--

   1. Indwelling sin always abides whilst we are in this world; therefore
   it is always to be mortified. The vain, foolish, and ignorant disputes
   of men about perfect keeping the commands of God, of perfection in this
   life, of being wholly and perfectly dead to sin, I meddle not now with.
   It is more than probable that the men of those abominations never knew
   what belonged to the keeping of any one of God's commands, and are so
   much below perfection of degrees, that they never attained to a
   perfection of parts in obedience or universal obedience in sincerity.
   And, therefore, many in our days who have talked of perfection have
   been wiser, and have affirmed it to consist in knowing no difference
   between good and evil. Not that they are perfect in the things we call
   good, but that all is alike to them, and the height of wickedness is
   their perfection. Others who have found out a new way to it, by denying
   original, indwelling sin, and attempering the spirituality of the law
   of God unto men's carnal hearts, as they have sufficiently discovered
   themselves to be ignorant of the life of Christ and the power of it in
   believers, so they have invented a new righteousness that the gospel
   knows not of, being vainly puffed up by their fleshly minds. For us,
   who dare not be wise above what is written, nor boast by other men's
   lives of what God hath not done for us, we say that indwelling sin
   lives in us, in some measure and degree, whilst we are in this world.
   We dare not speak as "though we had already attained, or were already
   perfect," Phil. iii. 12. Our "inward man is to be renewed day by day"
   whilst here we live, 2 Cor. iv. 16; and according to the renovations of
   the new are the breaches and decays of the old. Whilst we are here we
   "know but in part," 1 Cor. xiii. 12, having a remaining darkness to be
   gradually removed by our "growth in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
   Christ," 2 Pet. iii. 18; and "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, so
   that we cannot do the things that we would," Gal. v. 17: and are
   therefore defective in our obedience as well as in our light, 1 John i.
   8. We have a "body of death," Rom. vii. 24; from whence we are not
   delivered but by the death of our bodies, Phil. iii. 21. Now, it being
   our duty to mortify, to be killing of sin whilst it is in us, we must
   be at work. He that is appointed to kill an enemy, if he leave striking
   before the other ceases living, doth but half his work, Gal. vi. 9;
   Heb. xii. 1; 2 Cor. vii. 1.

   2. Sin doth not only still abide in us, but is still acting, still
   labouring to bring forth the deeds of the flesh. When sin lets us alone
   we may let sin alone; but as sin is never less quiet than when it seems
   to be most quiet, and its waters are for the most part deep when they
   are still, so ought our contrivances against it to be vigorous at all
   times and in all conditions, even where there is least suspicion. Sin
   doth not only abide in us, but "the law of the members is still
   rebelling against the law of the mind," Rom. vii. 23; and "the spirit
   that dwells in us lusteth to envy," James iv. 5. It is always in
   continual work; "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit," Gal. v. 17;
   lust is still tempting and conceiving sin, James i. 14; in every moral
   action it is always either inclining to evil, or hindering from that
   which is good, or disframing the spirit from communion with God. It
   inclines to evil. "The evil which I would not, that I do," saith the
   apostle, Rom. vii. 19. Whence is that? Why, "Because in me (that is, in
   my flesh) dwelleth no good thing." And it hinders from good: "The good
   that I would do, that I do not," verse 19; -- "Upon the same account,
   either I do it not, or not as I should; all my holy things being
   defiled by this sin." "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, so that ye
   cannot do the things that ye would," Gal. v. 17. And it unframes our
   spirit, and thence is called "The sin that so easily besets us," Heb.
   xii. 1; on which account are those grievous complaints that the apostle
   makes of it, Rom. vii. So that sin is always acting, always conceiving,
   always seducing and tempting. Who can say that he had ever any thing to
   do with God or for God, that indwelling sin had not a hand in the
   corrupting of what he did? And this trade will it drive more or less
   all our days. If, then, sin will be always acting, if we be not always
   mortifying, we are lost creatures. He that stands still and suffers his
   enemies to double blows upon him without resistance, will undoubtedly
   be conquered in the issue. If sin be subtle, watchful, strong, and
   always at work in the business of killing our souls, and we be
   slothful, negligent, foolish, in proceeding to the ruin thereof, can we
   expect a comfortable event? There is not a day but sin foils or is
   foiled, prevails or is prevailed on; and it will be so whilst we live
   in this world.

   I shall discharge him from this duty who can bring sin to a
   composition, to a cessation of arms in this warfare; if it will spare
   him any one day, in any one duty (provided he be a person that is
   acquainted with the spirituality of obedience and the subtlety of sin),
   let him say to his soul, as to this duty, "Soul, take thy rest." The
   saints, whose souls breathe after deliverance from its perplexing
   rebellion, know there is no safety against it but in a constant
   warfare.

   3. Sin will not only be striving, acting, rebelling, troubling,
   disquieting, but if let alone, if not continually mortified, it will
   bring forth great, cursed, scandalous, soul-destroying sins. The
   apostle tells us what the works and fruits of it are, Gal. v. 19-21,
   "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are, adultery, fornication,
   uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
   emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
   drunkenness, revellings, and such like." You know what it did in David
   and sundry others. Sin aims always at the utmost; every time it rises
   up to tempt or entice, might it have its own course, it would go out to
   the utmost sin in that kind. Every unclean thought or glance would be
   adultery if it could; every covetous desire would be oppression, every
   thought of unbelief would be atheism, might it grow to its head. Men
   may come to that, that sin may not be heard speaking a scandalous word
   in their hearts, -- that is, provoking to any great sin with scandal in
   its mouth; but yet every rise of lust, might it have its course, would
   come to the height of villany: it is like the grave, that is never
   satisfied. And herein lies no small share of the deceitfulness of sin,
   by which it prevails to the hardening of men, and so to their ruin,
   Heb. iii. 13, -- it is modest, as it were, in its first motions and
   proposals, but having once got footing in the heart by them, it
   constantly makes good its ground, and presseth on to some farther
   degrees in the same kind. This new acting and pressing forward makes
   the soul take little notice of what an entrance to a falling off from
   God is already made; it thinks all is indifferent well if there be no
   farther progress; and so far as the soul is made insensible of any sin,
   -- that is, as to such a sense as the gospel requireth, -- so far it is
   hardened: but sin is still pressing forward, and that because it hath
   no bounds but utter relinquishment of God and opposition to him; that
   it proceeds towards its height by degrees, making good the ground it
   hath got by hardness, is not from its nature, but its deceitfulness.
   Now nothing can prevent this but mortification; that withers the root
   and strikes at the head of sin every hour, so that whatever it aims at
   it is crossed in. There is not the best saint in the world but, if he
   should give over this duty, would fall into as many cursed sins as ever
   any did of his kind.

   4. This is one main reason why the Spirit and the new nature is given
   unto us, -- that we may have a principle within whereby to oppose sin
   and lust. "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit." Well! and what then?
   Why, "The Spirit also lusteth against the flesh," Gal. v. 17. There is
   a propensity in the Spirit, or spiritual new nature, to be acting
   against the flesh, as well as in the flesh to be acting against the
   Spirit: so 2 Pet. i. 4, 5. It is our participation of the divine nature
   that gives us an escape from the pollutions that are in the world
   through lust; and, Rom. vii. 23, there is a law of the mind, as well as
   a law of the members. Now this is, first, the most unjust and
   unreasonable thing in the world, when two combatants are engaged, to
   bind one and keep him up from doing his utmost, and to leave the other
   at liberty to wound him at his pleasure; and, secondly, the foolishest
   thing in the world to bind him who fights for our eternal condition,
   [salvation?] and to let him alone who seeks and violently attempts our
   everlasting ruin. The contest is for our lives and souls. Not to be
   daily employing the Spirit and new nature for the mortifying of sin, is
   to neglect that excellent succour which God hath given us against our
   greatest enemy. If we neglect to make use of what we have received, God
   may justly hold his hand from giving us more. His graces, as well as
   his gifts, are bestowed on us to use, exercise, and trade with. Not to
   be daily mortifying sin, is to sin against the goodness, kindness,
   wisdom, grace, and love of God, who hath furnished us with a principle
   of doing it.

   5. Negligence in this duty casts the soul into a perfect contrary
   condition to that which the apostle affirms was his, 2 Cor. iv. 16,
   "Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by
   day." In these the inward man perisheth, and the outward man is renewed
   day by day. Sin is as the house of David, and grace as the house of
   Saul. Exercise and success are the two main cherishers of grace in the
   heart; when it is suffered to lie still, it withers and decays: the
   things of it are ready to die, Rev. iii. 2; and sin gets ground towards
   the hardening of the heart, Heb. iii. 13. This is that which I intend:
   by the omission of this duty grace withers, lust flourisheth, and the
   frame of the heart grows worse and worse; and the Lord knows what
   desperate and fearful issues it hath had with many. Where sin, through
   the neglect of mortification, gets a considerable victory, it breaks
   the bones of the soul, Ps. xxxi. 10, li. 8, and makes a man weak, sick,
   and ready to die, Ps. xxxviii. 3-5, so that he cannot look up, Ps. xl.
   12, Isa. xxxiii. 24; and when poor creatures will take blow after blow,
   wound after wound, foil after foil, and never rouse up themselves to a
   vigorous opposition, can they expect any thing but to be hardened
   through the deceitfulness of sin, and that their souls should bleed to
   death? 2 John 8. Indeed, it is a sad thing to consider the fearful
   issues of this neglect, which lie under our eyes every day. See we not
   those, whom we knew humble, melting, broken-hearted Christians, tender
   and fearful to offend, zealous for God and all his ways, his Sabbaths
   and ordinances, grown, through a neglect of watching unto this duty,
   earthly, carnal, cold, wrathful, complying with the men of the world
   and things of the world, to the scandal of religion and the fearful
   temptation of them that know them? The truth is, what between placing
   mortification in a rigid, stubborn frame of spirit, which is for the
   most part earthly, legal, censorious, partial, consistent with wrath,
   envy, malice, pride, on the one hand, and pretences of liberty, grace,
   and I know not what, on the other, true evangelical mortification is
   almost lost amongst us: of which afterward.

   6. It is our duty to be "perfecting holiness in the fear of God," 2
   Cor. vii. 1; to be "growing in grace" every day, 1 Pet. ii. 2, 2 Pet.
   iii. 18; to be "renewing our inward man day by day," 2 Cor. iv. 16.
   Now, this cannot be done without the daily mortifying of sin. Sin sets
   its strength against every act of holiness, and against every degree we
   grow to. Let not that man think he makes any progress in holiness who
   walks not over the bellies of his lusts. He who doth not kill sin in
   this way takes no steps towards his journey's end. He who finds not
   opposition from it, and who sets not himself in every particular to its
   mortification, is at peace with it, not dying to it.

   This, then, is the first general principle of our ensuing discourse:
   Notwithstanding the meritorious mortification, if I may so speak, of
   all and every sin in the cross of Christ; notwithstanding the real
   foundation of universal mortification laid in our first conversion, by
   conviction of sin, humiliation for sin, and the implantation of a new
   principle opposite to it and destructive of it; -- yet sin doth so
   remain, so act and work in the best of believers, whilst they live in
   this world, that the constant daily mortification of it is all their
   days incumbent on them. Before I proceed to the consideration of the
   next principle, I cannot but by the way complain of many professors of
   these days, who, instead of bringing forth such great and evident
   fruits of mortification as are expected, scarce bear any leaves of it.
   There is, indeed, a broad light fallen upon the men of this generation,
   and together therewith many spiritual gifts communicated, which, with
   some other considerations, have wonderfully enlarged the bounds of
   professors and profession; both they and it are exceedingly multiplied
   and increased. Hence there is a noise of religion and religious duties
   in every corner, preaching in abundance, -- and that not in an empty,
   light, trivial, and vain manner, as formerly, but to a good proportion
   of a spiritual gift, -- so that if you will measure the number of
   believers by light, gifts, and profession, the church may have cause to
   say, "Who hath born me all these?" But now if you will take the measure
   of them by this great discriminating grace of Christians, perhaps you
   will find their number not so multiplied. Where almost is that
   professor who owes his conversion to these days of light, and so talks
   and professes at such a rate of spirituality as few in former days
   were, in any measure, acquainted with (I will not judge them, but
   perhaps boasting what the Lord hath done in them), that doth not give
   evidence of a miserably unmortified heart? If vain spending of time,
   idleness, unprofitableness in men's places, envy, strife, variance,
   emulations, wrath, pride, worldliness, selfishness, 1 Cor. i., be
   badges of Christians, we have them on us and amongst us in abundance.
   And if it be so with them who have much light, and which, we hope, is
   saving, what shall we say of some who would be accounted religious and
   yet despise gospel light, and for the duty we have in hand, know no
   more of it but what consists in men's denying themselves sometimes in
   outward enjoyments, which is one of the outmost branches of it, which
   yet they will seldom practise? The good Lord send out a spirit of
   mortification to cure our distempers, or we are in a sad condition!

   There are two evils which certainly attend every unmortified professor;
   -- the first, in himself; the other, in respect of others:--

   1. In himself. Let him pretend what he will, he hath slight thoughts of
   sin; at least, of sins of daily infirmity. The root of an unmortified
   course is the digestion of sin without bitterness in the heart. When a
   man hath confirmed his imagination to such an apprehension of grace and
   mercy as to be able, without bitterness, to swallow and digest daily
   sins, that man is at the very brink of turning the grace of God into
   lasciviousness, and being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Neither
   is there a greater evidence of a false and rotten heart in the world
   than to drive such a trade. To use the blood of Christ, which is given
   to cleanse us, 1 John i. 7, Tit. ii. 14; the exaltation of Christ,
   which is to give us repentance, Acts v. 31; the doctrine of grace,
   which teaches us to deny all ungodliness, Tit. ii. 11, 12, to
   countenance sin, is a rebellion that in the issue will break the bones.
   At this door have gone out from us most of the professors that have
   apostatized in the days wherein we live. For a while they were most of
   them under convictions; these kept them unto duties, and brought them
   to profession; so they "escaped the pollutions that are in the world,
   through the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ," 2 Pet. ii. 20: but
   having got an acquaintance with the doctrine of the gospel, and being
   weary of duty, for which they had no principle, they began to
   countenance themselves in manifold neglects from the doctrine of grace.
   Now, when once this evil had laid hold of them, they speedily tumbled
   into perdition.

   2. To others. It hath an evil influence on them on a twofold account:--

   (1.) It hardens them, by begetting in them a persuasion that they are
   in as good condition as the best professors. Whatever they see in them
   is so stained for want of this mortification that it is of no value
   with them. They have a zeal for religion; but it is accompanied with
   want of forbearance and universal righteousness. They deny prodigality,
   but with worldliness; they separate from the world, but live wholly to
   themselves, taking no care to exercise loving-kindness in the earth; or
   they talk spiritually, and live vainly; mention communion with God, and
   are every way conformed to the world; boasting of forgiveness of sin,
   and never forgiving others. And with such considerations do poor
   creatures harden their hearts in their unregeneracy.

   (2.) They deceive them, in making them believe that if they can come up
   to their condition it shall be well with them; and so it grows an easy
   thing to have the great temptation of repute in religion to wrestle
   withal, when they may go far beyond them as to what appears in them,
   and yet come short of eternal life. But of these things and all the
   evils of unmortified walking, afterward.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  Chapter III.

   The second general principle of the means of mortification proposed to
   confirmation -- The Spirit the only author of this work -- Vanity of
   popish mortification discovered -- Many means of it used by them not
   appointed of God -- Those appointed by him abused -- The mistakes of
   others in this business -- The Spirit is promised believers for this
   work, Ezek. xi. 19, xxxvi. 26 -- All that we receive from Christ is by
   the Spirit -- How the Spirit mortifies sin -- Gal. v. 19-23 -- The
   several ways of his operation to this end proposed -- How his work and
   our duty.

   The next principle relates to the great sovereign cause of the
   mortification treated of; which, in the words laid for the foundation
   of this discourse, is said to be the Spirit, -- that is, the Holy
   Ghost, as was evinced.

   II. He only is sufficient for this work; all ways and means without him
   are as a thing of nought; and he is the great efficient of it, -- he
   works in us as he pleases.

   1. In vain do men seek other remedies; they shall not be healed by
   them. What several ways have been prescribed for this, to have sin
   mortified, is known. The greatest part of popish religion, of that
   which looks most like religion in their profession, consists in
   mistaken ways and means of mortification. This is the pretence of their
   rough garments, whereby they deceive. Their vows, orders, fastings,
   penances, are all built on this ground; they are all for the mortifying
   of sin. Their preachings, sermons, and books of devotion, they look all
   this way. Hence, those who interpret the locusts that came out of the
   bottomless pit, Rev. ix. 3, to be the friars of the Romish church, who
   are said to torment men, so "that they should seek death and not find
   it," verse 6, think that they did it by their stinging sermons, whereby
   they convinced them of sin, but being not able to discover the remedy
   for the healing and mortifying of it, they kept them in such perpetual
   anguish and terror, and such trouble in their consciences, that they
   desired to die. This, I say, is the substance and glory of their
   religion; but what with their labouring to mortify dead creatures,
   ignorant of the nature and end of the work, -- what with the poison
   they mixed with it, in their persuasion of its merit, yea,
   supererogation (as they style their unnecessary merit, with a proud,
   barbarous title), -- their glory is their shame: but of them and their
   mortification more afterward, chap. vii.

   That the ways and means to be used for the mortification of sin
   invented by them are still insisted on and prescribed, for the same
   end, by some who should have more light and knowledge of the gospel, is
   known. Such directions to this purpose have of late been given by some,
   and are greedily catched at by others professing themselves
   Protestants, as might have become popish devotionists three or four
   hundred years ago. Such outside endeavours, such bodily exercises, such
   self-performances, such merely legal duties, without the least mention
   of Christ or his Spirit, are varnished over with swelling words of
   vanity, for the only means and expedients for the mortification of sin,
   as discover a deep-rooted unacquaintedness with the power of God and
   mystery of the gospel. The consideration hereof was one motive to the
   publishing of this plain discourse.

   Now, the reasons why the Papists can never, with all their endeavours,
   truly mortify any one sin, amongst others, are, --

   (1.) Because many of the ways and means they use and insist upon for
   this end were never appointed of God for that purpose. (Now, there is
   nothing in religion that hath any efficacy for compassing an end, but
   it hath it from God's appointment of it to that purpose.) Such as these
   are their rough garments, their vows, penances, disciplines, their
   course of monastical life, and the like; concerning all which God will
   say, "Who hath required these things at your hand?" and, "In vain do ye
   worship me, teaching for doctrines the traditions of men." Of the same
   nature are sundry self-vexations insisted on by others.

   (2.) Because those things that are appointed of God as means are not
   used by them in their due place and order, -- such as are praying,
   fasting, watching, meditation, and the like. These have their use in
   the business in hand; but whereas they are all to be looked on as
   streams, they look on them as the fountain. Whereas they effect and
   accomplish the end as means only, subordinate to the Spirit and faith,
   they look on them to do it by virtue of the work wrought. If they fast
   so much, and pray so much, and keep their hours and times, the work is
   done. As the apostle says of some in another case, "They are always
   learning, never coming to the knowledge of the truth;" so they are
   always mortifying, but never come to any sound mortification. In a
   word, they have sundry means to mortify the natural man, as to the
   natural life here we lead; none to mortify lust or corruption.

   This is the general mistake of men ignorant of the gospel about this
   thing; and it lies at the bottom of very much of that superstition and
   will-worship that hath been brought into the world. What horrible
   self-macerations were practised by some of the ancient authors of
   monastical devotion! what violence did they offer to nature! what
   extremity of sufferings did they put themselves upon! Search their ways
   and principles to the bottom, and you will find that it had no other
   root but this mistake, namely, that attempting rigid mortification,
   they fell upon the natural man instead of the corrupt old man, -- upon
   the body wherein we live instead of the body of death.

   Neither will the natural Popery that is in others do it. Men are galled
   with the guilt of a sin that hath prevailed over them; they instantly
   promise to themselves and God that they will do so no more; they watch
   over themselves, and pray for a season, until this heat waxes cold, and
   the sense of sin is worn off: and so mortification goes also, and sin
   returns to its former dominion. Duties are excellent food for an
   unhealthy soul; they are no physic for a sick soul. He that turns his
   meat into his medicine must expect no great operation. Spiritually sick
   men cannot sweat out their distemper with working. But this is the way
   of men who deceive their own souls; as we shall see afterward.

   That none of these ways are sufficient is evident from the nature of
   the work itself that is to be done; it is a work that requires so many
   concurrent actings in it as no self-endeavour can reach unto, and is of
   that kind that an almighty energy is necessary for its accomplishment;
   as shall be afterward manifested.

   2. It is, then, the work of the Spirit. For, --

   (1.) He is promised of God to be given unto us to do this work. The
   taking away of the stony heart, -- that is, the stubborn, proud,
   rebellious, unbelieving heart, -- is in general the work of
   mortification that we treat of. Now this is still promised to be done
   by the Spirit, Ezek. xi. 19, xxxvi. 26, "I will give my Spirit, and
   take away the stony heart;" and by the Spirit of God is this work
   wrought when all means fail, Isa. lvii. 17, 18.

   (2.) We have all our mortification from the gift of Christ, and all the
   gifts of Christ are communicated to us and given us by the Spirit of
   Christ: "Without Christ we can do nothing," John xv. 5. All
   communications of supplies and relief, in the beginnings, increasings,
   actings of any grace whatever, from him, are by the Spirit, by whom he
   alone works in and upon believers. From him we have our mortification:
   "He is exalted and made a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto
   us," Acts v. 31; and of our repentance our mortification is no small
   portion. How doth he do it? Having "received the promise of the Holy
   Ghost," he sends him abroad for that end, Acts ii. 33. You know the
   manifold promises he made of sending the Spirit, as Tertullian speaks,
   "Vicariam navare operam," to do the works that he had to accomplish in
   us.

   The resolution of one or two questions will now lead me nearer to what
   I principally intend.

   The first is, How doth the Spirit mortify sin?

   I answer, in general, three ways:--

   [1.] By causing our hearts to abound in grace and the fruits that are
   contrary to the flesh, and the fruits thereof and principles of them.
   So the apostle opposes the fruits of the flesh and of the Spirit: "The
   fruits of the flesh," says he, "are so and so," Gal. v. 19-21; "but,"
   says he, "the fruits of the Spirit are quite contrary, quite of another
   sort," verses 22, 23. Yea; but what if these are in us and do abound,
   may not the other abound also? No, says he, verse 24, "They that are
   Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts." But
   how? Why, verse 25, "By living in the Spirit and walking after the
   Spirit;" -- that is, by the abounding of these graces of the Spirit in
   us, and walking according to them. For, saith the apostle, "These are
   contrary one to another," verse 17; so that they cannot both be in the
   same subject, in any intense or high degree. This "renewing of us by
   the Holy Ghost," as it is called, Tit. iii. 5, is one great way of
   mortification; he causes us to grow, thrive, flourish, and abound in
   those graces which are contrary, opposite, and destructive to all the
   fruits of the flesh, and to the quiet or thriving of indwelling sin
   itself.

   [2.] By a real physical efficiency on the root and habit of sin, for
   the weakening, destroying, and taking it away. Hence he is called a
   "Spirit of judgment and burning," Isa. iv. 4, really consuming and
   destroying our lusts. He takes away the stony heart by an almighty
   efficiency; for as he begins the work as to its kind, so he carries it
   on as to its degrees. He is the fire which burns up the very root of
   lust.

   [3.] He brings the cross of Christ into the heart of a sinner by faith,
   and gives us communion with Christ in his death, and fellowship in his
   sufferings: of the manner whereof more afterward.

   Secondly. If this be the work of the Spirit alone, how is it that we
   are exhorted to it? -- seeing the Spirit of God only can do it, let the
   work be left wholly to him.

   [1.] It is no otherwise the work of the Spirit but as all graces and
   good works which are in us are his. He "works in us to will and to do
   of his own good pleasure," Phil. ii. 13; he works "all our works in
   us," Isa. xxvi. 12, -- "the work of faith with power," 2 Thess. i. 11,
   Col. ii. 12; he causes us to pray, and is a "Spirit of supplication,"
   Rom. viii. 26, Zech. xii 10; and yet we are exhorted, and are to be
   exhorted, to all these.

   [2.] He doth not so work our mortification in us as not to keep it
   still an act of our obedience. The Holy Ghost works in us and upon us,
   as we are fit to be wrought in and upon; that is, so as to preserve our
   own liberty and free obedience. He works upon our understandings,
   wills, consciences, and affections, agreeably to their own natures; he
   works in us and with us, not against us or without us; so that his
   assistance is an encouragement as to the facilitating of the work, and
   no occasion of neglect as to the work itself. And, indeed, I might here
   bewail the endless, foolish labour of poor souls, who, being convinced
   of sin, and not able to stand against the power of their convictions,
   do set themselves, by innumerable perplexing ways and duties, to keep
   down sin, but, being strangers to the Spirit of God, all in vain. They
   combat without victory, have war without peace, and are in slavery all
   their days. They spend their strength for that which is not bread, and
   their labour for that which profiteth not.

   This is the saddest warfare that any poor creature can be engaged in. A
   soul under the power of conviction from the law is pressed to fight
   against sin, but hath no strength for the combat. They cannot but
   fight, and they can never conquer; they are like men thrust on the
   sword of enemies on purpose to be slain. The law drives them on, and
   sin beats them back. Sometimes they think, indeed, that they have
   foiled sin, when they have only raised a dust that they see it not;
   that is, they distemper their natural affections of fear, sorrow, and
   anguish, which makes them believe that sin is conquered when it is not
   touched. By that time they are cold, they must to the battle again; and
   the lust which they thought to be slain appears to have had no wound.

   And if the case be so sad with them who do labour and strive, and yet
   enter not into the kingdom, what is their condition who despise all
   this; who are perpetually under the power and dominion of sin, and love
   to have it so; and are troubled at nothing, but that they cannot make
   sufficient provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof?
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  Chapter IV.

   The last principle; of the usefulness of mortification -- The vigour
   and comfort of our spiritual lives depend on our mortification -- In
   what sense -- Not absolutely and necessarily; Ps. lxxxviii., Heman's
   condition -- Not as on the next and immediate cause -- As a means; by
   removing of the contrary -- The desperate effects of any unmortified
   lust; it weakens the soul, Ps. xxxviii. 3, 8, sundry ways, and darkens
   it -- All graces improved by the mortification of sin -- The best
   evidence of sincerity.

   The last principle I shall insist on (omitting, first, the necessity of
   mortification unto life, and, secondly, the certainty of life upon
   mortification) is, --

   III. That the life, vigour, and comfort of our spiritual life depend
   much on our mortification of sin.

   Strength and comfort, and power and peace, in our walking with God, are
   the things of our desires. Were any of us asked seriously, what it is
   that troubles us, we must refer it to one of these heads:-- either we
   want strength or power, vigour and life, in our obedience, in our
   walking with God; or we want peace, comfort, and consolation therein.
   Whatever it is that may befall a believer that doth not belong to one
   of these two heads, doth not deserve to be mentioned in the days of our
   complaints.

   Now, all these do much depend on a constant course of mortification,
   concerning which observe, --

   1. I do not say they proceed from it, as though they were necessarily
   tied to it. A man may be carried on in a constant course of
   mortification all his days; and yet perhaps never enjoy a good day of
   peace and consolation. So it was with Heman, Ps. lxxxviii.; his life
   was a life of perpetual mortification and walking with God, yet terrors
   and wounds were his portion all his days. But God singled out Heman, a
   choice friend, to make him an example to them that afterward should be
   in distress. Canst thou complain if it be no otherwise with thee than
   it was with Heman, that eminent servant of God? and this shall be his
   praise to the end of the world. God makes it his prerogative to speak
   peace and consolation, Isa. lvii. 18, 19. "I will do that work," says
   God, "I will comfort him," verse 18. But how? By an immediate work of
   the new creation: "I create it," says God. The use of means for the
   obtaining of peace is ours; the bestowing of it is God's prerogative.

   2. In the ways instituted by God for to give us life, vigour, courage,
   and consolation, mortification is not one of the immediate causes of
   it. They are the privileges of our adoption made known to our souls
   that give us immediately these things. "The Spirit bearing witness with
   our spirits that we are the children of God," giving us a new name and
   a white stone, adoption and justification, -- that is, as to the sense
   and knowledge of them, -- are the immediate causes (in the hand of the
   Spirit) of these things. But this I say, --

   3. In our ordinary walking with God, and in an ordinary course of his
   dealing with us, the vigour and comfort of our spiritual lives depend
   much on our mortification, not only as a "causa sine qua non," but as a
   thing that hath an effectual influence thereinto. For, --

   (1.) This alone keeps sin from depriving us of the one and the other.

   Every unmortified sin will certainly do two things:-- [1.] It will
   weaken the soul, and deprive it of its vigour. [2.] It will darken the
   soul, and deprive it of its comfort and peace.

   [1.] It weakens the soul, and deprives it of its strength. When David
   had for a while harboured an unmortified lust in his heart, it broke
   all his bones, and left him no spiritual strength; hence he complained
   that he was sick, weak, wounded, faint. "There is," saith he, "no
   soundness in me," Ps. xxxviii. 3; "I am feeble and sore broken," verse
   8; "yea, I cannot so much as look up," Ps. xl. 12. An unmortified lust
   will drink up the spirit, and all the vigour of the soul, and weaken it
   for all duties. For, --

   1st. It untunes and unframes the heart itself, by entangling its
   affections. It diverts the heart from the spiritual frame that is
   required for vigorous communion with God; it lays hold on the
   affections, rendering its object beloved and desirable, so expelling
   the love of the Father, 1 John. ii. 15, iii 17; so that the soul cannot
   say uprightly and truly to God, "Thou art my portion," having something
   else that it loves. Fear, desire, hope, which are the choice affections
   of the soul, that should be full of God, will be one way or other
   entangled with it.

   2dly. It fills the thoughts with contrivances about it. Thoughts are
   the great purveyors of the soul to bring in provision to satisfy its
   affections; and if sin remain unmortified in the heart, they must ever
   and anon be making provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
   thereof. They must glaze, adorn, and dress the objects of the flesh,
   and bring them home to give satisfaction; and this they are able to do,
   in the service of a defiled imagination, beyond all expression.

   3dly. It breaks out and actually hinders duty. The ambitious man must
   be studying, and the worldling must be working or contriving, and the
   sensual, vain person providing himself for vanity, when they should be
   engaged in the worship of God.

   Were this my present business, to set forth the breaches, ruin,
   weakness, desolations, that one unmortified lust will bring upon a
   soul, this discourse must be extended much beyond my intendment.

   [2.] As sin weakens, so it darkens the soul. It is a cloud, a thick
   cloud, that spreads itself over the face of the soul, and intercepts
   all the beams of God's love and favour. It takes away all sense of the
   privilege of our adoption; and if the soul begins to gather up thoughts
   of consolation, sin quickly scatters them: of which afterward.

   Now, in this regard doth the vigour and power of our spiritual life
   depend on our mortification: It is the only means of the removal of
   that which will allow us neither the one nor the other. Men that are
   sick and wounded under the power of lust make many applications for
   help; they cry to God when the perplexity of their thoughts overwhelms
   them, even to God do they cry, but are not delivered; in vain do they
   use many remedies, -- " they shall not be healed." So, Hos. v. 13,
   "Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound," and attempted sundry
   remedies: nothing will do until they come (verse 15) to "acknowledge
   their offence." Men may see their sickness and wounds, but yet, if they
   make not due applications, their cure will not be effected.

   (2.) Mortification prunes all the graces of God, and makes room for
   them in our hearts to grow. The life and vigour of our spiritual lives
   consists in the vigour and flourishing of the plants of grace in our
   hearts. Now, as you may see in a garden, let there be a precious herb
   planted, and let the ground be untilled, and weeds grow about it,
   perhaps it will live still, but be a poor, withering, unuseful thing.
   You must look and search for it, and sometimes can scarce find it; and
   when you do, you can scarce know it, whether it be the plant you look
   for or no; and suppose it be, you can make no use of it at all. When,
   let another of the same kind be set in the ground, naturally as barren
   and bad as the other, but let it be well weeded, and every thing that
   is noxious and hurtful removed from it, -- it flourishes and thrives;
   you may see it at first look into the garden, and have it for your use
   when you please. So it is with the graces of the Spirit that are
   planted in our hearts. That is true; they are still, they abide in a
   heart where there is some neglect of mortification; but they are ready
   to die, Rev. iii. 2, they are withering and decaying. The heart is like
   the sluggard's field, -- so overgrown with weeds that you can scarce
   see the good corn. Such a man may search for faith, love, and zeal, and
   scarce be able to find any; and if he do discover that these graces are
   there yet alive and sincere, yet they are so weak, so clogged with
   lusts, that they are of very little use; they remain, indeed, but are
   ready to die. But now let the heart be cleansed by mortification, the
   weeds of lust constantly and daily rooted up (as they spring daily,
   nature being their proper soil), let room be made for grace to thrive
   and flourish, -- how will every grace act its part, and be ready for
   every use and purpose!

   (3.) As to our peace; as there is nothing that hath any evidence of
   sincerity without it, so I know nothing that hath such an evidence of
   sincerity in it; -- which is no small foundation of our peace.
   Mortification is the soul's vigorous opposition to self, wherein
   sincerity is most evident.

                                   Chapter V.

   The principal intendment of the whole discourse proposed -- The first
   main case of conscience stated -- What it is to mortify any sin,
   negatively considered -- Not the utter destruction of it in this life
   -- Not the dissimulation of it --Not the improvement of any natural
   principle -- Not the diversion of it -- Not an occasional conquest --
   Occasional conquests of sin, what and when; upon the eruption of sin;
   in time of danger or trouble.

   These things being premised, I come to my principal intention, of
   handling some questions or practical cases that present themselves in
   this business of mortification of sin in believers.

   The first, which is the head of all the rest, and whereunto they are
   reduced, may be considered as lying under the ensuing proposal:--

   Suppose a man to be a true believer, and yet finds in himself a
   powerful indwelling sin, leading him captive to the law of it,
   consuming his heart with trouble, perplexing his thoughts, weakening
   his soul as to duties of communion with God, disquieting him as to
   peace, and perhaps defiling his conscience, and exposing him to
   hardening through the deceitfulness of sin, -- what shall he do? what
   course shall he take and insist on for the mortification of this sin,
   lust, distemper, or corruption, to such a degree as that, though it be
   not utterly destroyed, yet, in his contest with it, he may be enabled
   to keep up power, strength, and peace in communion with God?

   In answer to this important inquiry, I shall do these things:--

   I. Show what it is to mortify any sin, and that both negatively and
   positively, that we be not mistaken in the foundation.

   II. Give general directions for such things as without which it will be
   utterly impossible for any one to get any sin truly and spiritually
   mortified.

   III. Draw out the particulars whereby this is to be done; in the whole
   carrying on this consideration, that it is not of the doctrine of
   mortification in general, but only in reference to the particular case
   before proposed, that I am treating.

   I. 1. (1.) To mortify a sin is not utterly to kill, root it out, and
   destroy it, that it should have no more hold at all nor residence in
   our hearts. It is true this is that which is aimed at; but this is not
   in this life to be accomplished. There is no man that truly sets
   himself to mortify any sin, but he aims at, intends, desires its utter
   destruction, that it should leave neither root nor fruit in the heart
   or life. He would so kill it that it should never move nor stir any
   more, cry or call, seduce or tempt, to eternity. Its not-being is the
   thing aimed at. Now, though doubtless there may, by the Spirit and
   grace of Christ, a wonderful success and eminency of victory against
   any sin be attained, so that a man may have almost constant triumph
   over it, yet an utter killing and destruction of it, that it should not
   be, is not in this life to be expected. This Paul assures us of, Phil.
   iii. 12, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already
   perfect." He was a choice saint, a pattern for believers, who, in faith
   and love, and all the fruits of the Spirit, had not his fellow in the
   world, and on that account ascribes perfection to himself in comparison
   of others, verse 15; yet he had not "attained," he was not "perfect,"
   but was "following after:" still a vile body he had, and we have, that
   must be changed by the great power of Christ at last, verse 21. This we
   would have; but God sees it best for us that we should be complete in
   nothing in ourselves, that in all things we must be "complete in
   Christ;" which is best for us, Col. ii. 10.

   (2.) I think I need not say it is not the dissimulation of a sin. When
   a man on some outward respects forsakes the practice of any sin, men
   perhaps may look on him as a changed man. God knows that to his former
   iniquity he hath added cursed hypocrisy, and is got in a safer path to
   hell than he was in before. He hath got another heart than he had, that
   is more cunning; not a new heart, that is more holy.

   (3.) The mortification of sin consists not in the improvement of a
   quiet, sedate nature. Some men have an advantage by their natural
   constitution so far as that they are not exposed to such violence of
   unruly passions and tumultuous affections as many others are. Let now
   these men cultivate and improve their natural frame and temper by
   discipline, consideration, and prudence, and they may seem to
   themselves and others very mortified men, when, perhaps, their hearts
   are a standing sink of all abominations. Some man is never so much
   troubled all his life, perhaps, with anger and passion, nor doth
   trouble others, as another is almost every day; and yet the latter hath
   done more to the mortification of the sin than the former. Let not such
   persons try their mortification by such things as their natural temper
   gives no life or vigour to. Let them bring themselves to self-denial,
   unbelief, envy, or some such spiritual sin, and they will have a better
   view of themselves.

   (4.) A sin is not mortified when it is only diverted. Simon Magus for a
   season left his sorceries; but his covetousness and ambition, that set
   him on work, remained still, and would have been acting another way.
   Therefore Peter tells him, "I perceive thou art in the gall of
   bitterness;" -- "Notwithstanding the profession thou hast made,
   notwithstanding thy relinquishment of thy sorceries, thy lust is as
   powerful as ever in thee; the same lust, only the streams of it are
   diverted. It now exerts and puts forth itself another way, but it is
   the old gall of bitterness still." A man may be sensible of a lust, set
   himself against the eruptions of it, take care that it shall not break
   forth as it has done, but in the meantime suffer the same corrupted
   habit to vent itself some other way; as he who heals and skins a
   running sore thinks himself cured, but in the meantime his flesh
   festereth by the corruption of the same humour, and breaks out in
   another place. And this diversion, with the alterations that attend it,
   often befalls men on accounts wholly foreign unto grace: change of the
   course of life that a man was in, of relations, interests, designs, may
   effect it; yea, the very alterations in men's constitutions, occasioned
   by a natural progress in the course of their lives, may produce such
   changes as these. Men in age do not usually persist in the pursuit of
   youthful lusts, although they have never mortified any one of them. And
   the same is the case of bartering of lusts, and leaving to serve one
   that a man may serve another. He that changes pride for worldliness,
   sensuality for Pharisaism, vanity in himself to the contempt of others,
   let him not think that he hath mortified the sin that he seems to have
   left. He hath changed his master, but is a servant still.

   (5.) Occasional conquests of sin do not amount to a mortifying of it.

   There are two occasions or seasons wherein a man who is contending with
   any sin may seem to himself to have mortified it:--

   [1.] When it hath had some sad eruption, to the disturbance of his
   peace, terror of his conscience, dread of scandal, and evident
   provocation of God. This awakens and stirs up all that is in the man,
   and amazes him, fills him with abhorrency of sin, and himself for it;
   sends him to God, makes him cry out as for life, to abhor his lust as
   hell, and to set himself against it. The whole man, spiritual and
   natural, being now awaked, sin shrinks in its head, appears not, but
   lies as dead before him: as when one that hath drawn nigh to an army in
   the night, and hath killed a principal person, -- instantly the guards
   awake, men are roused up, and strict inquiry is made after the enemy,
   who, in the meantime, until the noise and tumult be over, hides
   himself, or lies like one that is dead, yet with firm resolution to do
   the like mischief again upon the like opportunity. Upon the sin among
   the Corinthians, see how they muster up themselves for the surprisal
   and destruction of it, 2 Epist. chap. vii. 11. So it is in a person
   when a breach hath been made upon his conscience, quiet, perhaps
   credit, by his lust, in some eruption of actual sin; -- carefulness,
   indignation, desire, fear, revenge, are all set on work about it and
   against it, and lust is quiet for a season, being run down before them;
   but when the hurry is over and the inquest past, the thief appears
   again alive, and is as busy as ever at his work.

   [2.] In a time of some judgment, calamity, or pressing affliction; the
   heart is then taken up with thoughts and contrivances of flying from
   the present troubles, fears, and dangers. This, as a convinced person
   concludes, is to be done only by relinquishment of sin, which gains
   peace with God. It is the anger of God in every affliction that galls a
   convinced person. To be quit of this, men resolve at such times against
   their sins. Sin shall never more have any place in them; they will
   never again give up themselves to the service of it. Accordingly, sin
   is quiet, stirs not, seems to be mortified; not, indeed, that it hath
   received any one wound, but merely because the soul hath possessed its
   faculties, whereby it should exert itself, with thoughts inconsistent
   with the motions thereof; which, when they are laid aside, sin returns
   again to its former life and vigour. So they Ps. lxxviii. 32-37, are a
   full instance and description of this frame of spirit whereof I speak:
   "For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous
   works. Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
   in trouble. When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned
   and inquired early after God. And they remembered that God was their
   rock, and the high God their redeemer. Nevertheless they did flatter
   him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. For
   their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his
   covenant." I no way doubt but that when they sought, and returned, and
   inquired early after God, they did it with full purpose of heart as to
   the relinquishment of their sins; it is expressed in the word
   "returned." To turn or return to the Lord is by a relinquishment of
   sin. This they did "early," -- with earnestness and diligence; but yet
   their sin was unmortified for all this, verses 36, 37. And this is the
   state of many humiliations in the days of affliction, and a great
   deceit in the hearts of believers themselves lies oftentimes herein.

   These and many other ways there are whereby poor souls deceive
   themselves, and suppose they have mortified their lusts, when they live
   and are mighty, and on every occasion break forth, to their disturbance
   and disquietness.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  Chapter VI.

   The mortification of sin in particular described -- The several parts
   and degrees thereof -- The habitual weakening of its root and principle
   -- The power of lust to tempt -- Differences of that power as to
   persons and times -- Constant fighting against sin -- The parts thereof
   considered -- Success against it -- The sum of this discourse
   considered.

   What it is to mortify a sin in general, which will make farther way for
   particular directions, is nextly to be considered.

   2. The mortification of a lust consists in three things:--

   (1.) An habitual weakening of it. Every lust is a depraved habit or
   disposition, continually inclining the heart to evil. Thence is that
   description of him who hath no lust truly mortified, Gen. vi. 5, "Every
   imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually." He
   is always under the power of a strong bent and inclination to sin. And
   the reason why a natural man is not always perpetually in the pursuit
   of some one lust, night and day, is because he hath many to serve,
   every one crying to be satisfied; thence he is carried on with great
   variety, but still in general he lies towards the satisfaction of self.

   We will suppose, then, the lust or distemper whose mortification is
   inquired after to be in itself a strong, deeply-rooted, habitual
   inclination and bent of will and affections unto some actual sin, as to
   the matter of it, though not, under that formal consideration, always
   stirring up imaginations, thoughts, and contrivances about the object
   of it. Hence, men are said to have their "hearts set upon evil," the
   bent of their spirits lies towards it, to make "provision for the
   flesh." [3] And a sinful, depraved habit, as in many other things, so
   in this, differs from all natural or moral habits whatever: for whereas
   they incline the soul gently and suitably to itself, sinful habits
   impel with violence and impetuousness; whence lusts are said to fight
   or wage "war against the soul," [4] 1 Pet. ii. 11, -- to rebel or rise
   up in war with that conduct and opposition which is usual therein, [5]
   Rom. vii. 23, -- to lead captive, or effectually captivating upon
   success in battle, -- all works of great violence and impetuousness.

   I might manifest fully, from that description we have of it, Rom. vii.,
   how it will darken the mind, extinguish convictions, dethrone reason,
   interrupt the power and influence of any considerations that may be
   brought to hamper it, and break through all into a flame. But this is
   not my present business. Now, the first thing in mortification is the
   weakening of this habit of sin or lust, that it shall not, with that
   violence, earnestness, frequency, rise up, conceive, tumultuate,
   provoke, entice, disquiet, as naturally it is apt to do, James i. 14,
   15.

   I shall desire to give one caution or rule by the way, and it is this:
   Though every lust doth in its own nature equally, universally, incline
   and impel to sin, yet this must be granted with these two
   limitations:--

   [1.] One lust, or a lust in one man, may receive many accidental
   improvements, heightenings, and strengthenings, which may give it life,
   power, and vigour, exceedingly above what another lust hath, or the
   same lust (that is, of the same kind and nature) in another man. When a
   lust falls in with the natural constitutions and temper, with a
   suitable course of life, with occasions, or when Satan hath got a fit
   handle to it to manage it, as he hath a thousand ways so to do, that
   lust grows violent and impetuous above others, or more than the same
   lust in another man; then the steams of it darken the mind so, that
   though a man knows the same things as formerly, yet they have no power
   nor influence on the will, but corrupt affections and passions are set
   by it at liberty.

   But especially, lust gets strength by temptation. When a suitable
   temptation falls in with a lust, it gives it a new life, vigour, power,
   violence, and rage, which it seemed not before to have or to be capable
   of. Instances to this purpose might be multiplied; but it is the design
   of some part of another treatise to evince this observation.

   [2.] Some lusts are far more sensible and discernible in their violent
   actings than others. Paul puts a difference between uncleanness and all
   other sins: 1 Cor. vi. 18, "Flee fornication. Every sin that a man
   doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth
   against his own body." Hence, the motions of that sin are more
   sensible, more discernible than of others; when perhaps the love of the
   world, or the like, is in a person no less habitually predominant than
   that, yet it makes not so great a combustion in the whole man.

   And on this account some men may go in their own thoughts and in the
   eyes of the world for mortified men, who yet have in them no less
   predominancy of lust than those who cry out with astonishment upon the
   account of its perplexing tumultuatings, yea, than those who have by
   the power of it been hurried into scandalous sins; only their lusts are
   in and about things which raise not such a tumult in the soul, about
   which they are exercised with a calmer frame of spirit, the very fabric
   of nature being not so nearly concerned in them as in some other.

   I say, then, that the first thing in mortification is the weakening of
   this habit, that it shall not impel and tumultuate as formerly; that it
   shall not entice and draw aside; that it shall not disquiet and perplex
   the killing of its life, vigour, promptness, and readiness to be
   stirring. This is called "crucifying the flesh with the lusts thereof,"
   Gal. v. 24; that is, taking away its blood and spirits that give it
   strength and power, -- the wasting of the body of death "day by day," 2
   Cor. iv. 16.

   As a man nailed to the cross; he first struggles, and strives, and
   cries out with great strength and might, but, as his blood and spirits
   waste, his strivings are faint and seldom, his cries low and hoarse,
   scarce to be heard; -- when a man first sets on a lust or distemper, to
   deal with it, it struggles with great violence to break loose; it cries
   with earnestness and impatience to be satisfied and relieved; but when
   by mortification the blood and spirits of it are let out, it moves
   seldom and faintly, cries sparingly, and is scarce heard in the heart;
   it may have sometimes a dying pang, that makes an appearance of great
   vigour and strength, but it is quickly over, especially if it be kept
   from considerable success. This the apostle describes, as in the whole
   chapter, so especially, Rom. vi. 6.

   "Sin," saith he, "is crucified; it is fastened to the cross." To what
   end? "That the body of death may be destroyed," the power of sin
   weakened and abolished by little and little, that "henceforth we should
   not serve sin;" that is, that sin might not incline, impel us with such
   efficacy as to make us servants to it, as it hath done heretofore. And
   this is spoken not only with respect to carnal and sensual affections,
   or desires of worldly things, -- not only in respect of the lust of the
   flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, -- but also as to
   the flesh, that is, in the mind and will, in that opposition unto God
   which is in us by nature. Of what nature soever the troubling distemper
   be, by what ways soever it make itself out, either by impelling to evil
   or hindering from that which is good, the rule is the same; and unless
   this be done effectually, all after-contention will not compass the end
   aimed at. A man may beat down the bitter fruit from an evil tree until
   he is weary; whilst the root abides in strength and vigour, the beating
   down of the present fruit will not hinder it from bringing forth more.
   This is the folly of some men; they set themselves with all earnestness
   and diligence against the appearing eruption of lust, but, leaving the
   principle and root untouched, perhaps unsearched out, they make but
   little or no progress in this work of mortification.

   (2.) In constant fighting and contending against sin. To be able always
   to be laying load on sin is no small degree of mortification. When sin
   is strong and vigorous, the soul is scarce able to make any head
   against it; it sighs, and groans, and mourns, and is troubled, as David
   speaks of himself, but seldom has sin in the pursuit. David complains
   that his sin had "taken fast hold upon him, that he could not look up,"
   Ps. xl. 12. How little, then, was he able to fight against it! Now,
   sundry things are required unto and comprised in this fighting against
   sin:--

   [1.] To know that a man hath such an enemy to deal withal, to take
   notice of it, to consider it as an enemy indeed, and one that is to be
   destroyed by all means possible, is required hereunto. As I said
   before, the contest is vigorous and hazardous, -- it is about the
   things of eternity. When, therefore, men have slight and transient
   thoughts of their lusts, it is no great sign that they are mortified,
   or that they are in a way for their mortification. This is every man's
   "knowing the plague of his own heart," 1 Kings viii. 38, without which
   no other work can be done. It is to be feared that very many have
   little knowledge of the main enemy that they carry about with them in
   their bosoms. This makes them ready to justify themselves, and to be
   impatient of reproof or admonition, not knowing that they are in any
   danger, 2 Chron. xvi. 10.

   [2.] To labour to be acquainted with the ways, wiles, methods,
   advantages, and occasions of its success, is the beginning of this
   warfare. So do men deal with enemies. They inquire out their counsels
   and designs, ponder their ends, consider how and by what means they
   have formerly prevailed, that they may be prevented. In this consists
   the greatest skill in conduct. Take this away, and all waging of war,
   wherein is the greatest improvement of human wisdom and industry, would
   be brutish. So do they deal with lust who mortify it indeed. Not only
   when it is actually vexing, enticing, and seducing, but in their
   retirements they consider, "This is our enemy; this is his way and
   progress, these are his advantages, thus hath he prevailed, and thus he
   will do, if not prevented." So David, "My sin is ever before me," Ps.
   li. 3. And, indeed, one of the choicest and most eminent parts of
   practically spiritual wisdom consists in finding out the subtilties,
   policies, and depths of any indwelling sin; to consider and know
   wherein its greatest strength lies, -- what advantage it uses to make
   of occasions, opportunities, temptations, -- what are its pleas,
   pretences, reasonings, -- what its stratagems, colours, excuses; to set
   the wisdom of the Spirit against the craft of the old man; to trace
   this serpent in all its turnings and windings; to be able to say, at
   its most secret and (to a common frame of heart) imperceptible actings,
   "This is your old way and course; I know what you aim at;" -- and so to
   be always in readiness is a good part of our warfare.

   [3.] To load it daily with all the things which shall after be
   mentioned, that are grievous, killing, and destructive to it, is the
   height of this contest. Such a one never thinks his lust dead because
   it is quiet, but labours still to give it new wounds, new blows every
   day. So the apostle, Col. iii. 5.

   Now, whilst the soul is in this condition, whilst it is thus dealing,
   it is certainly uppermost; sin is under the sword and dying.

   (3.) In success. Frequent success against any lust is another part and
   evidence of mortification. By success I understand not a mere
   disappointment of sin, that it be not brought forth nor accomplished,
   but a victory over it, and pursuit of it to a complete conquest. For
   instance, when the heart finds sin at any time at work, seducing,
   forming imaginations to make provision for the flesh, to fulfil the
   lusts thereof, it instantly apprehends sin, and brings it to the law of
   God and love of Christ, condemns it, follows it with execution to the
   uttermost.

   Now, I say, when a man comes to this state and condition, that lust is
   weakened in the root and principle, that its motions and actions are
   fewer and weaker than formerly, so that they are not able to hinder his
   duty nor interrupt his peace, -- when he can, in a quiet, sedate frame
   of spirit, find out and fight against sin, and have success against it,
   -- then sin is mortified in some considerable measure, and,
   notwithstanding all its opposition, a man may have peace with God all
   his days.

   Unto these heads, then, do I refer the mortification aimed at; that is,
   of any one perplexing distemper, whereby the general pravity and
   corruption of our nature attempts to exert and put forth itself:--

   First, The weakening of its indwelling disposition, whereby it
   inclines, entices, impels to evil, rebels, opposes, fights against God,
   by the implanting, habitual residence, and cherishing of a principle of
   grace that stands in direct opposition to it and is destructive of it,
   is the foundation of it. So, by the implanting and growth of humility
   is pride weakened, passion by patience, uncleanness by purity of mind
   and conscience, love of this world by heavenly-mindedness: which are
   graces of the Spirit, or the same habitual grace variously acting
   itself by the Holy Ghost, according to the variety or diversity of the
   objects about which it is exercised; as the other are several lusts, or
   the same natural corruption variously acting itself, according to the
   various advantages and occasions that it meets withal. -- The
   promptness, alacrity, vigour of the Spirit, or new man, in contending
   with, cheerful fighting against, the lust spoken of, by all the ways
   and with all the means that are appointed thereunto, constantly using
   the succours provided against its motions and actings, is a second
   thing hereunto required. -- Success unto several degrees attends these
   two. Now this, if the distemper hath not an unconquerable advantage
   from its natural situation, may possibly be to such a universal
   conquest as the soul may never more sensibly feel its opposition, and
   shall, however, assuredly arise to an allowance of peace to the
   conscience, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace.

   General rules, without which no lust will be mortified -- No
   mortification unless a man be a believer -- Dangers of attempting
   mortification of sin by unregenerate persons -- The duty of unconverted
   persons as to this business of mortification considered -- The vanity
   of the Papists' attempts and rules for mortification thence discovered.

   II. The ways and means whereby a soul may proceed to the mortification
   of any particular lust and sin, which Satan takes advantage by to
   disquiet and weaken him, come next under consideration.

   Now, there are some general considerations to be premised, concerning
   some principles and foundations of this work, without which no man in
   the world, be he never so much raised by convictions, and resolved for
   the mortification of any sin, can attain thereunto.

   General rules and principles, without which no sin will be ever
   mortified, are these:--

   1. Unless a man be a believer, -- that is, one that is truly ingrafted
   into Christ, -- he can never mortify any one sin; I do not say, unless
   he know himself to be so, but unless indeed he be so.

   Mortification is the work of believers: Rom. viii. 13, "If ye through
   the Spirit," etc., -- ye believers, to whom there is no condemnation,
   verse 1. They alone are exhorted to it: Col. iii. 5, "Mortify therefore
   your members which are upon the earth." Who should mortify? You who
   "are risen with Christ," verse 1; whose "life is hid with Christ in
   God," verse 3; who "shall appear with him in glory," verse 4. An
   unregenerate man may do something like it; but the work itself, so as
   it may be acceptable with God, he can never perform. You know what a
   picture of it is drawn in some of the philosophers, -- Seneca, Tully,
   Epictetus; what affectionate discourses they have of contempt of the
   world and self, of regulating and conquering all exorbitant affections
   and passions! The lives of most of them manifested that their maxims
   differed as much from true mortification as the sun painted on a
   sign-post from the sun in the firmament; they had neither light nor
   heat. Their own Lucian sufficiently manifests what they all were. There
   is no death of sin without the death of Christ. You know what attempts
   there are made after it by the Papists, in their vows, penances, and
   satisfactions. I dare say of them (I mean as many of them as act upon
   the principles of their church, as they call it) what Paul says of
   Israel in point of righteousness, Rom. ix. 31, 32, -- They have
   followed after mortification, but they have not attained to it.
   Wherefore? "Because they seek it not by faith, but as it were by the
   works of the law." The same is the state and condition of all amongst
   ourselves who, in obedience to their convictions and awakened
   consciences, do attempt a relinquishment of sin; -- they follow after
   it, but they do not attain it.

   It is true, it is, it will be, required of every person whatever that
   hears the law or gospel preached, that he mortify sin. It is his duty,
   but it is not his immediate duty; it is his duty to do it, but to do it
   in God's way. If you require your servant to pay so much money for you
   in such a place, but first to go and take it up in another, it is his
   duty to pay the money appointed, and you will blame him if he do it
   not; yet it was not his immediate duty, -- he was first to take it up,
   according to your direction. So it is in this case: sin is to be
   mortified, but something is to be done in the first place to enable us
   thereunto.

   I have proved that it is the Spirit alone that can mortify sin; he is
   promised to do it, and all other means without him are empty and vain.
   How shall he, then, mortify sin that hath not the Spirit? A man may
   easier see without eyes, speak without a tongue, than truly mortify one
   sin without the Spirit. Now, how is he attained? It is the Spirit of
   Christ: and as the apostle says, "If we have not the Spirit of Christ,
   we are none of his," Rom. viii. 9; so, if we are Christ's, have an
   interest in him, we have the Spirit, and so alone have power for
   mortification. This the apostle discourses at large, Rom. viii. 8, "So
   then they that are in the flesh cannot please God." It is the inference
   and conclusion he makes of his foregoing discourse about our natural
   state and condition, and the enmity we have unto God and his law
   therein. If we are in the flesh, if we have not the Spirit, we cannot
   do any thing that should please God. But what is our deliverance from
   this condition? Verse 9, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
   Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you;" -- "Ye
   believers, that have the Spirit of Christ, ye are not in the flesh."
   There is no way of deliverance from the state and condition of being in
   the flesh but by the Spirit of Christ. And what if this Spirit of
   Christ be in you? Why, then, you are mortified; verse 10, "The body is
   dead because of sin," or unto it; mortification is carried on; the new
   man is quickened to righteousness. This the apostle proves, verse 11,
   from the union we have with Christ by the Spirit, which will produce
   suitable operations in us to what it wrought in him. All attempts,
   then, for mortification of any lust, without an interest in Christ, are
   vain. Many men that are galled with and for sin, the arrows of Christ
   for conviction, by the preaching of the word, or some affliction having
   been made sharp in their hearts, do vigorously set themselves against
   this or that particular lust, wherewith their consciences have been
   most disquieted or perplexed. But, poor creatures! they labour in the
   fire, and their work consumeth. When the Spirit of Christ comes to this
   work he will be "like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap," and he
   will purge men as gold and as silver, Mal. iii. 2, 3, -- take away
   their dross and tin, their filth and blood, as Isa. iv. 4; but men must
   be gold and silver in the bottom, or else refining will do them no
   good. The prophet gives us the sad issue of wicked men's utmost
   attempts for mortification, by what means soever that God affords them:
   Jer. vi. 29, 30, "The bellows are burned, and the lead is consumed of
   the fire; the founder melteth in vain. Reprobate silver shall men call
   them, because the Lord hath rejected them." And what is the reason
   hereof? Verse 28, They were "brass and iron" when they were put into
   the furnace. Men may refine brass and iron long enough before they will
   be good silver.

   I say, then, mortification is not the present business of unregenerate
   men. God calls them not to it as yet; conversion is their work, -- the
   conversion of the whole soul, -- not the mortification of this or that
   particular lust. You would laugh at a man that you should see setting
   up a great fabric, and never take any care for a foundation; especially
   if you should see him so foolish as that, having a thousand experiences
   that what he built one day fell down another, he would yet continue in
   the same course. So it is with convinced persons; though they plainly
   see, that what ground they get against sin one day they lose another,
   yet they will go on in the same road still, without inquiring where the
   destructive flaw in their progress lies. When the Jews, upon the
   conviction of their sin, were cut to the heart, Acts ii. 37, and cried
   out, "What shall we do?" what doth Peter direct them to do? Does he bid
   them go and mortify their pride, wrath, malice, cruelty, and the like?
   No; he knew that was not their present work, but he calls them to
   conversion and faith in Christ in general, verse 38. Let the soul be
   first thoroughly converted, and then, "looking on Him whom they had
   pierced," humiliation and mortification will ensue. Thus, when John
   came to preach repentance and conversion, he said, "The axe is now laid
   to the root of the tree," Matt. iii. 10. The Pharisees had been laying
   heavy burdens, imposing tedious duties, and rigid means of
   mortification, in fastings, washings, and the like, all in vain. Says
   John, "The doctrine of conversion is for you; the axe in my hand is
   laid to the root." And our Saviour tells us what is to be done in this
   case; says he, "Do men gather grapes from thorns?" Matt. vii. 16. But
   suppose a thorn be well pruned and cut, and have pains taken with him?
   "Yea, but he will never bear figs," verses 17, 18; it cannot be but
   every tree will bring forth fruit according to its own kind. What is
   then to be done, he tells us, Matt. xii. 33, "Make the tree good, and
   his fruit will be good." The root must be dealt with, the nature of the
   tree changed, or no good fruit will be brought forth.

   This is that I aim at: unless a man be regenerate, unless he be a
   believer, all attempts that he can make for mortification, be they
   never so specious and promising, -- all means he can use, let him
   follow them with never so much diligence, earnestness, watchfulness,
   and intention of mind and spirit, -- are to no purpose. In vain shall
   he use many remedies; he shall not be healed. Yea, there are sundry
   desperate evils attending an endeavour in convinced persons, that are
   no more but so, to perform this duty:--

   (1.) The mind and soul is taken up about that which is not the man's
   proper business, and so he is diverted from that which is so. God lays
   hold by his word and judgments on some sin in him, galls his
   conscience, disquiets his heart, deprives him of his rest; now other
   diversions will not serve his turn; he must apply himself to the work
   before him. The business in hand being to awake the whole man unto a
   consideration of the state and condition wherein he is, that he might
   be brought home to God, instead hereof he sets himself to mortify the
   sin that galls him, -- which is a pure issue of self-love, to be freed
   from his trouble, and not at all to the work he is called unto, -- and
   so is diverted from it. Thus God tells us of Ephraim, when he "spread
   his net upon them, and brought them down as the fowls of heaven, and
   chastised them," Hos. vii. 12, caught them, entangled them, convinced
   them that they could not escape; saith he of them, "They return, but
   not to the Most High;" -- they set themselves to a relinquishment of
   sin, but not in that manner, by universal conversion, as God called for
   it. Thus are men diverted from coming unto God by the most glorious
   ways that they can fix upon to come to him by. And this is one of the
   most common deceits whereby men ruin their own souls. I wish that some
   whose trade it is to daub with untempered mortar in the things of God
   did not teach this deceit, and cause the people to err by their
   ignorance. What do men do, what ofttimes are they directed unto, when
   their consciences are galled by sin and disquietment from the Lord, who
   hath laid hold upon them? Is not a relinquishment of the sin, as to
   practice, that they are, in some fruits of it, perplexed withal, and
   making head against it, the sum of what they apply themselves unto? and
   is not the gospel end of their convictions lost thereby? Here men abide
   and perish.

   (2.) This duty being a thing good in itself, in its proper place, a
   duty evidencing sincerity, bringing home peace to the conscience; a man
   finding himself really engaged in it, his mind and heart set against
   this or that sin, with purpose and resolution to have no more to do
   with it, -- he is ready to conclude that his state and condition is
   good, and so to delude his own soul. For, --

   [1.] When his conscience hath been made sick with sin, and he could
   find no rest, when he should go to the great Physician of souls, and
   get healing in his blood, the man by this engagement against sin
   pacifies and quiets his conscience, and sits down without going to
   Christ at all. Ah! how many poor souls are thus deluded to eternity!
   "When Ephraim saw his sickness, he sent to king Jareb," Hos. v. 13;
   which kept him off from God. The whole bundle of the popish religion is
   made up of designs and contrivances to pacify conscience without
   Christ; all described by the apostle, Rom. x. 3.

   [2.] By this means men satisfy themselves that their state and
   condition is good, seeing they do that which is a work good in itself,
   and they do not do it to be seen. They know they would have the work
   done in sincerity, and so are hardened in a kind of self-righteousness.

   (3.) When a man hath thus for a season been deluded, and hath deceived
   his own soul, and finds in a long course of life that indeed his sin is
   not mortified, or if he hath changed one he hath gotten another, he
   begins at length to think that all contending is in vain, -- he shall
   never be able to prevail; he is making a dam against water that
   increaseth on him. Hereupon he gives over, as one despairing of any
   success, and yields up himself to the power of sin and that habit of
   formality that he hath gotten.

   And this is the usual issue with persons attempting the mortification
   of sin without an interest in Christ first obtained. It deludes them,
   hardens them, -- destroys them. And therefore we see that there are not
   usually more vile and desperate sinners in the world than such as,
   having by conviction been put on this course, have found it fruitless,
   and deserted it without a discovery of Christ. And this is the
   substance of the religion and godliness of the choicest formalists in
   the world, and of all those who in the Roman synagogue are drawn to
   mortification, as they drive Indians to baptism or cattle to water. I
   say, then, that mortification is the work of believers, and believers
   only. To kill sin is the work of living men; where men are dead (as all
   unbelievers, the best of them, are dead), sin is alive, and will live.

   2. It is the work of faith, the peculiar work of faith. Now, if there
   be a work to be done that will be effected by one only instrument, it
   is the greatest madness for any to attempt the doing of it that hath
   not that instrument. Now, it is faith that purifies the heart, Acts xv.
   9; or, as Peter speaks, we "purify our souls in obeying the truth
   through the Spirit," 1 Pet. i. 22; and without it, it will not be done.

   What hath been spoken I suppose is sufficient to make good my first
   general rule:-- Be sure to get an interest in Christ; if you intend to
   mortify any sin without it, it will never be done.

   Obj. You will say, "What, then, would you have unregenerate men that
   are convinced of the evil of sin do? Shall they cease striving against
   sin, live dissolutely, give their lusts their swing, and be as bad as
   the worst of men? This were a way to set the whole world into
   confusion, to bring all things into darkness, to set open the
   flood-gates of lust, and lay the reins upon the necks of men to rush
   into all sin with delight and greediness, like the horse into the
   battle."

   Ans. 1. God forbid! It is to be looked on as a great issue of the
   wisdom, goodness, and love of God, that by manifold ways and means he
   is pleased to restrain the sons of men from running forth into that
   compass of excess and riot which the depravedness of their nature would
   carry them out unto with violence. By what way soever this is done, it
   is an issue of the care, kindness, and goodness of God, without which
   the whole earth would be a hell of sin and confusion.

   2. There is a peculiar convincing power in the word, which God is
   oftentimes pleased to put forth, to the wounding, amazing, and, in some
   sort, humbling of sinners, though they are never converted. And the
   word is to be preached though it hath this end, yet not with this end.
   Let, then, the word be preached, and the sins of men [will be] rebuked,
   lust will be restrained, and some oppositions will be made against sin;
   though that be not the effect aimed at.

   3. Though this be the work of the word and Spirit, and it be good in
   itself, yet it is not profitable nor available as to the main end in
   them in whom it is wrought; they are still in the gall of bitterness,
   and under the power of darkness.

   4. Let men know it is their duty, but in its proper place; I take not
   men from mortification, but put them upon conversion. He that shall
   call a man from mending a hole in the wall of his house, to quench a
   fire that is consuming the whole building, is not his enemy. Poor soul!
   it is not thy sore finger but thy hectic fever that thou art to apply
   thyself to the consideration of. Thou settest thyself against a
   particular sin, and dost not consider that thou art nothing but sin.

   Let me add this to them who are preachers of the word, or intend,
   through the good hand of God, that employment: It is their duty to
   plead with men about their sins, to lay load on particular sins, but
   always remember that it be done with that which is the proper end of
   law and gospel; -- that is, that they make use of the sin they speak
   against to the discovery of the state and condition wherein the sinner
   is; otherwise, haply, they may work men to formality and hypocrisy, but
   little of the true end of preaching the gospel will be brought about.
   It will not avail to beat a man off from his drunkenness into a sober
   formality. A skilful master of the assemblies lays his axe at the root,
   drives still at the heart. To inveigh against particular sins of
   ignorant, unregenerate persons, such as the land is full of, is a good
   work; but yet, though it may be done with great efficacy, vigour, and
   success, if this be all the effect of it, that they are set upon the
   most sedulous endeavours of mortifying their sins preached down, all
   that is done is but like the beating of an enemy in an open field, and
   driving him into an impregnable castle, not to be prevailed against.
   Get you at any time a sinner at the advantage, on the account of any
   one sin whatever? have you any thing to take hold of him by? -- bring
   it to his state and condition, drive it up to the head, and there deal
   with him. To break men off particular sins, and not to break their
   hearts, is to deprive ourselves of advantages of dealing with them.

   And herein is the Roman mortification grievously peccant; they drive
   all sorts of persons to it, without the least consideration whether
   they have a principle for it or no. Yea, they are so far from calling
   on men to believe, that they may be able to mortify their lusts, that
   they call men to mortification instead of believing. The truth is, they
   neither know what it is to believe nor what mortification itself
   intends. Faith with them is but a general assent to the doctrine taught
   in their church; and mortification the betaking of a man by a vow to
   some certain course of life, wherein he denies himself something of the
   use of the things of this world, not without a considerable
   compensation. Such men know neither the Scriptures nor the power of
   God. Their boasting of their mortification is but their glorying in
   their shame. Some casuists among ourselves, who, overlooking the
   necessity of regeneration, do avowedly give this for a direction to all
   sorts of persons that complain of any sin or lust, that they should vow
   against it, at least for a season, a month or so, seem to have a
   scantling of light in the mystery of the gospel, much like that of
   Nicodemus when he came first to Christ. They bid men vow to abstain
   from their sin for a season. This commonly makes their lust more
   impetuous. Perhaps with great perplexity they keep their word; perhaps
   not, which increases their guilt and torment. Is their sin at all
   mortified hereby? Do they find a conquest over it? Is their condition
   changed, though they attain a relinquishment of it? Are they not still
   in the gall of bitterness? Is not this to put men to make brick, if not
   without straw, yet, which is worse, without strength? What promise hath
   any unregenerate man to countenance him in this work? what assistance
   for the performance of it? Can sin be killed without an interest in the
   death of Christ, or mortified without the Spirit? If such directions
   should prevail to change men's lives, as seldom they do, yet they never
   reach to the change of their hearts or conditions. They may make men
   self-justiciaries or hypocrites, not Christians. It grieves me ofttimes
   to see poor souls, that have a zeal for God and a desire of eternal
   welfare, kept by such directors and directions under a hard,
   burdensome, outside worship and service of God, with many specious
   endeavours for mortification, in an utter ignorance of the
   righteousness of Christ, and unacquaintedness with his Spirit, all
   their days. Persons and things of this kind I know too many. If ever
   God shine into their hearts, to give them the knowledge of his glory in
   the face of his Son Jesus Christ, they will see the folly of their
   present way.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Chapter VIII.

   The second general rule proposed -- Without universal sincerity for the
   mortifying of every lust, no lust will be mortified -- Partial
   mortification always from a corrupt principle -- Perplexity of
   temptation from a lust oftentimes a chastening for other negligences.

   2. The second principle which to this purpose I shall propose is
   this:--

   Without sincerity and diligence in a universality of obedience, there
   is no mortification of any one perplexing lust to be obtained.

   The other was to the person; this to the thing itself. I shall a little
   explain this position.

   A man finds any lust to bring him into the condition formerly
   described; it is powerful, strong, tumultuating, leads captive, vexes,
   disquiets, takes away peace; he is not able to bear it; wherefore he
   sets himself against it, prays against it, groans under it, sighs to be
   delivered: but in the meantime, perhaps, in other duties, -- in
   constant communion with God, -- in reading, prayer, and meditation, --
   in other ways that are not of the same kind with the lust wherewith he
   is troubled, -- he is loose and negligent. Let not that man think that
   ever he shall arrive to the mortification of the lust he is perplexed
   withal. This is a condition that not seldom befalls men in their
   pilgrimage. The Israelites, under a sense of their sin, drew nigh to
   God with much diligence and earnestness, with fasting and prayer, Isa.
   lviii.: many expressions are made of their earnestness in the work,
   verse 2 "They seek me daily, and delight to know my ways; they ask of
   me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God."
   But God rejects all. Their fast is a remedy that will not heal them,
   and the reason given of it, verses 5-7, is, because they were
   particular in this duty. They attended diligently to that, but in
   others were negligent and careless. He that hath a "running sore" (it
   is the Scripture expression) upon him, arising from an ill habit of
   body, contracted by intemperance and ill diet, let him apply himself
   with what diligence and skill he can to the cure of his sore, if he
   leave the general habit of his body under distempers, his labour and
   travail will be in vain. So will his attempts be that shall endeavour
   to stop a bloody issue of sin and filth in his soul, and is not equally
   careful of his universal spiritual temperature and constitution. For,
   --

   (1.) This kind of endeavour for mortification proceeds from a corrupt
   principle, ground, and foundation; so that it will never proceed to a
   good issue. The true and acceptable principles of mortification shall
   be afterward insisted on. Hatred of sin as sin, not only as galling or
   disquieting, a sense of the love of Christ in the cross, lie at the
   bottom of all true spiritual mortification. Now, it is certain that
   that which I speak of proceeds from self-love. Thou settest thyself
   with all diligence and earnestness to mortify such a lust or sin; what
   is the reason of it? It disquiets thee, it hath taken away thy peace,
   it fills thy heart with sorrow, and trouble, and fear; thou hast no
   rest because of it. Yea; but, friend, thou hast neglected prayer or
   reading; thou hast been vain and loose in thy conversation in other
   things, that have not been of the same nature with that lust wherewith
   thou art perplexed. These are no less sins and evils than those under
   which thou groanest. Jesus Christ bled for them also. Why dost thou not
   set thyself against them also? If thou hatest sin as sin, every evil
   way, thou wouldst be no less watchful against every thing that grieves
   and disquiets the Spirit of God, than against that which grieves and
   disquiets thine own soul. It is evident that thou contendest against
   sin merely because of thy own trouble by it. Would thy conscience be
   quiet under it, thou wouldst let it alone. Did it not disquiet thee, it
   should not be disquieted by thee. Now, canst thou think that God will
   set in with such hypocritical endeavours, -- that ever his Spirit will
   bear witness to the treachery and falsehood of thy spirit? Dost thou
   think he will ease thee of that which perplexeth thee, that thou mayst
   be at liberty to that which no less grieves him? No. Says God, "Here is
   one, if he could be rid of this lust I should never hear of him more;
   let him wrestle with this, or he is lost." Let not any man think to do
   his own work that will not do God's. God's work consists in universal
   obedience; to be freed of the present perplexity is their own only.
   Hence is that of the apostle, 2 Cor. vii. 1, "Cleanse yourselves from
   all pollution of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear
   of God." If we will do any thing, we must do all things. So, then, it
   is not only an intense opposition to this or that peculiar lust, but a
   universal humble frame and temper of heart, with watchfulness over
   every evil and for the performance of every duty, that is accepted.

   (2.) How knowest thou but that God hath suffered the lust wherewith
   thou hast been perplexed to get strength in thee, and power over thee,
   to chasten thee for thy other negligences and common lukewarmness in
   walking before him; at least to awaken thee to the consideration of thy
   ways, that thou mayst make a thorough work and change in thy course of
   walking with him?

   The rage and predominancy of a particular lust is commonly the fruit
   and issue of a careless, negligent course in general, and that upon a
   double account:--

   [1.] As its natural effect, if I may so say. Lust, as I showed in
   general, lies in the heart of every one, even the best, whilst he
   lives; and think not that the Scripture speaks in vain, that it is
   subtle, cunning, crafty, -- that it seduces, entices, fights, rebels.
   Whilst a man keeps a diligent watch over his heart, its root and
   fountain, -- whilst above all keepings he keeps his heart, whence are
   the issues of life and death, -- lust withers and dies in it. But if,
   through negligence, it makes an eruption any particular way, gets a
   passage to the thoughts by the affections, and from them and by them
   perhaps breaks out into open sin in the conversation, the strength of
   it bears that way it hath found out, and that way mainly it urgeth,
   until, having got a passage, it then vexes and disquiets, and is not
   easily to be restrained: thus, perhaps, a man may be put to wrestle all
   his days in sorrow with that which, by a strict and universal watch,
   might easily have been prevented.

   [2.] As I said, God oftentimes suffers it to chasten our other
   negligences: for as with wicked men, he gives them up to one sin as the
   judgment of another, a greater for the punishment of a less, or one
   that will hold them more firmly and securely for that which they might
   have possibly obtained a deliverance from; [6] so even with his own, he
   may, he doth, leave them sometimes to some vexatious distempers, either
   to prevent or cure some other evil. So was the messenger of Satan let
   loose on Paul, that he "might not be lifted up through the abundance of
   spiritual revelations." [7] Was it not a correction to Peter's vain
   confidence, that he was left to deny his Master? Now, if this be the
   state and condition of lust in its prevalency, that God oftentimes
   suffers it so to prevail, at least to admonish us, and to humble us,
   perhaps to chasten and correct us for our general loose and careless
   walking, is it possible that the effect should be removed and the cause
   continued, -- that the particular lust should be mortified and the
   general course be unreformed? He, then, that would really, thoroughly,
   and acceptably mortify any disquieting lust, let him take care to be
   equally diligent in all parts of obedience, and know that every lust,
   every omission of duty, is burdensome to God, though but one is so to
   him. [8] Whilst there abides a treachery in the heart to indulge to any
   negligence in not pressing universally to all perfection in obedience,
   the soul is weak, as not giving faith its whole work; and selfish, as
   considering more the trouble of sin than the filth and guilt of it; and
   lives under a constant provocation of God: so that it may not expect
   any comfortable issue in any spiritual duty that it doth undertake,
   much less in this under consideration, which requires another principle
   and frame of spirit for its accomplishment.

   Particular directions in relation to the foregoing case proposed --
   First. Consider the dangerous symptoms of any lust -- 1. Inveterateness
   -- 2. Peace obtained under it; the several ways whereby that is done --
   3. Frequency of success in its seductions -- 4. The soul's fighting
   against it with arguments only taken from the event -- 5. Its being
   attended with judiciary hardness -- 6. Its withstanding particular
   dealings from God -- The state of persons in whom these things are
   found.

   III. The foregoing general rules being supposed, particular directions
   to the soul for its guidance under the sense of a disquieting lust or
   distemper, being the main thing I aim at, come next to be proposed.
   Now, of these some are previous and preparatory, and in some of them
   the work itself is contained. Of the first sort are these ensuing:--

   First. Consider what dangerous symptoms thy lust hath attending or
   accompanying it, -- whether it hath any deadly mark on it or no; if it
   hath, extraordinary remedies are to be used; an ordinary course of
   mortification will not do it.

   You will say, "What are these dangerous marks and symptoms, the
   desperate attendancies of an indwelling lust, that you intend?" Some of
   them I shall name:--

   1. Inveterateness. -- If it hath lain long corrupting in thy heart, if
   thou hast suffered it to abide in power and prevalency, without
   attempting vigorously the killing of it, and the healing of the wounds
   thou hast received by it, for some long season, thy distemper is
   dangerous. Hast thou permitted worldliness, ambition, greediness of
   study, to eat up other duties, the duties wherein thou oughtest to hold
   constant communion with God, for some long season? or uncleanness to
   defile thy heart with vain, and foolish, and wicked imaginations for
   many days? Thy lust hath a dangerous symptom. So was the case with
   David: Ps. xxxviii. 5, "My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my
   foolishness." When a lust hath lain long in the heart, corrupting,
   festering, cankering, it brings the soul to a woful condition. In such
   a case an ordinary course of humiliation will not do the work: whatever
   it be, it will by this means insinuate itself more or less into all the
   faculties of the soul, and habituate the affections to its company and
   society; it grows familiar to the mind and conscience, that they do not
   startle at it as a strange thing, but are bold with it as that which
   they are wonted unto; yea, it will get such advantage by this means as
   oftentimes to exert and put forth itself without having any notice
   taken of it at all, as it seems to have been with Joseph in his
   swearing by the life of Pharaoh. Unless some extraordinary course be
   taken, such a person hath no ground in the world to expect that his
   latter end shall be peace.

   For, first, How will he be able to distinguish between the long abode
   of an unmortified lust and the dominion of sin, which cannot befall a
   regenerate person? Secondly, How can he promise himself that it shall
   ever be otherwise with him, or that his lust will cease tumultuating
   and seducing, when he sees it fixed and abiding, and hath done so for
   many days, and hath gone through a variety of conditions with him? It
   may be it hath tried mercies and afflictions, and those possibly so
   remarkable that the soul could not avoid the taking special notice of
   them; it may be it hath weathered out many a storm, and passed under
   much variety of gifts in the administration of the word; and will it
   prove an easy thing to dislodge an inmate pleading a title by
   prescription? Old neglected wounds are often mortal, always dangerous.
   Indwelling distempers grow rusty and stubborn by continuance in ease
   and quiet. Lust is such an inmate as, if it can plead time and some
   prescription, will not easily be ejected. As it never dies of itself,
   so if it be not daily killed it will always gather strength.

   2. Secret pleas of the heart for the countenancing of itself, and
   keeping up its peace, notwithstanding the abiding of a lust, without a
   vigorous gospel attempt for its mortification, is another dangerous
   symptom of a deadly distemper in the heart. Now, there be several ways
   whereby this may be done. I shall name some of them; as, --

   (1.) When upon thoughts, perplexing thoughts about sin, instead of
   applying himself to the destruction of it, a man searches his heart to
   see what evidences he can find of a good condition, notwithstanding
   that sin and lust, so that it may go well with him.

   For a man to gather up his experiences of God, to call them to mind, to
   collect them, consider, try, improve them, is an excellent thing, -- a
   duty practised by all the saints, commended in the Old Testament and
   the New. This was David's work when he "communed with his own heart,"
   and called to remembrance the former loving-kindness of the Lord. [9]
   This is the duty that Paul sets us to practise, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. And as
   it is in itself excellent, so it hath beauty added to it by a proper
   season, a time of trial or temptation, or disquietness of the heart
   about sin, -- is a picture of silver to set off this golden apple, as
   Solomon speaks. But now to do it for this end, to satisfy conscience,
   which cries and calls for another purpose, is a desperate device of a
   heart in love with sin. When a man's conscience shall deal with him,
   when God shall rebuke him for the sinful distemper of his heart, if he,
   instead of applying himself to get that sin pardoned in the blood of
   Christ and mortified by his Spirit, shall relieve himself by any such
   other evidences as he hath, or thinks himself to have, and so
   disentangle himself from under the yoke that God was putting on his
   neck, his condition is very dangerous, his wound hardly curable. Thus
   the Jews, under the gallings of their own consciences and the
   convincing preaching of our Saviour, supported themselves with this,
   that they were "Abraham's children," and on that account accepted with
   God; and so countenanced themselves in all abominable wickedness, to
   their utter ruin.

   This is, in some degree, a blessing of a man's self, and saying that
   upon one account or other he shall have peace, "although he adds
   drunkenness to thirst." Love of sin, undervaluation of peace and of all
   tastes of love from God, are inwrapped in such a frame. Such a one
   plainly shows, that if he can but keep up hope of escaping the "wrath
   to come," he can be well content to be unfruitful in the world, at any
   distance from God that is not final separation. What is to be expected
   from such a heart?

   (2.) By applying grace and mercy to an unmortified sin, or one not
   sincerely endeavoured to be mortified, is this deceit carried on. This
   is a sign of a heart greatly entangled with the love of sin. When a man
   hath secret thoughts in his heart, not unlike those of Naaman about his
   worshipping in the house of Rimmon, [10] "In all other things I will
   walk with God, but in this thing, God be merciful unto me," his
   condition is sad. It is true, indeed, a resolution to this purpose, to
   indulge a man's self in any sin on the account of mercy, seems to be,
   and doubtless in any course is, altogether inconsistent with Christian
   sincerity, and is a badge of a hypocrite, and is the "turning of the
   grace of God into wantonness;" [11] yet I doubt not but, through the
   craft of Satan and their own remaining unbelief, the children of God
   may themselves sometimes be ensnared with this deceit of sin, or else
   Paul would never have so cautioned them against it as he doth, Rom. vi.
   1, 2. Yea, indeed, there is nothing more natural than for fleshly
   reasonings to grow high and strong upon this account. The flesh would
   fain be indulged unto upon the account of grace, and every word that is
   spoken of mercy, it stands ready to catch at and to pervert it, to its
   own corrupt aims and purposes. To apply mercy, then, to a sin not
   vigorously mortified is to fulfil the end of the flesh upon the gospel.

   These and many other ways and wiles a deceitful heart will sometimes
   make use of, to countenance itself in its abominations. Now, when a man
   with his sin is in this condition, that there is a secret liking of the
   sin prevalent in his heart, and though his will be not wholly set upon
   it, yet he hath an imperfect velleity towards it, he would practise it
   were it not for such and such considerations, and hereupon relieves
   himself other ways than by the mortification and pardon of it in the
   blood of Christ; that man's "wounds stink and are corrupt," and he
   will, without speedy deliverance, be at the door of death.

   3. Frequency of success in sin's seduction, in obtaining the prevailing
   consent of the will unto it, is another dangerous symptom. This is that
   I mean: When the sin spoken of gets the consent of the will with some
   delight, though it be not actually outwardly perpetrated, yet it hath
   success. A man may not be able, upon outward considerations, to go
   along with sin to that which James calls the "finishing" of it, [12] as
   to the outward acts of sin, when yet the will of sinning may be
   actually obtained; then hath it, I say, success. Now, if any lust be
   able thus far to prevail in the soul of any man, as his condition may
   possibly be very bad and himself be unregenerate, so it cannot possibly
   be very good, but dangerous; and it is all one upon the matter whether
   this be done by the choice of the will or by inadvertency, for that
   inadvertency itself is in a manner chosen. When we are inadvertent and
   negligent, where we are bound to watchfulness and carefulness, that
   inadvertency doth not take off from the voluntariness of what we do
   thereupon; for although men do not choose and resolve to be negligent
   and inadvertent, yet if they choose the things that will make them so,
   they choose inadvertency itself as a thing may be chosen in its cause.

   And let not men think that the evil of their hearts is in any measure
   extenuated because they seem, for the most part, to be surprised into
   that consent which they seem to give unto it; for it is negligence of
   their duty in watching over their hearts that betrays them into that
   surprisal.

   4. When a man fighteth against his sin only with arguments from the
   issue or the punishment due unto it, this is a sign that sin hath taken
   great possession of the will, and that in the heart there is a
   superfluity of naughtiness. Such a man as opposes nothing to the
   seduction of sin and lust in his heart but fear of shame among men or
   hell from God, is sufficiently resolved to do the sin if there were no
   punishment attending it; which, what it differs from living in the
   practice of sin, I know not. Those who are Christ's, and are acted in
   their obedience upon gospel principles, have the death of Christ, the
   love of God, the detestable nature of sin, the preciousness of
   communion with God, a deep-grounded abhorrency of sin as sin, to oppose
   to any seduction of sin, to all the workings, strivings, fightings of
   lust in their hearts. So did Joseph. "How shall I do this great evil,"
   saith he, "and sin against the Lord?" my good and gracious God. [13]
   And Paul, "The love of Christ constraineth us;" [14] and, "Having
   received these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of
   the flesh and spirit," 2 Cor. vii. 1. But now if a man be so under the
   power of his lust that he hath nothing but law to oppose it withal, if
   he cannot fight against it with gospel weapons, but deals with it
   altogether with hell and judgment, which are the proper arms of the
   law, it is most evident that sin hath possessed itself of his will and
   affections to a very great prevalency and conquest.

   Such a person hath cast off, as to the particular spoken of, the
   conduct of renewing grace, and is kept from ruin only by restraining
   grace; and so far is he fallen from grace, and returned under the power
   of the law. And can it be thought that this is not a great provocation
   to Christ, that men should cast off his easy, gentle yoke and rule, and
   cast themselves under the iron yoke of the law, merely out of
   indulgence unto their lusts?

   Try thyself by this also: When thou art by sin driven to make a stand,
   so that thou must either serve it and rush at the command of it into
   folly, like the horse into the battle, or make head against it to
   suppress it, what dost thou say to thy soul? what dost thou expostulate
   with thyself? Is this all, -- "Hell will be the end of this course;
   vengeance will meet with me and find me out?" It is time for thee to
   look about thee; evil lies at the door. Paul's main argument to evince
   that sin shall not have dominion over believers is, that they "are not
   under the law, but under grace," Rom. vi. 14. If thy contendings
   against sin be all on legal accounts, from legal principles and
   motives, what assurance canst thou attain unto that sin shall not have
   dominion over thee, which will be thy ruin?

   Yea, know that this reserve will not long hold out. If thy lust hath
   driven thee from stronger gospel forts, it will speedily prevail
   against this also. Do not suppose that such considerations will deliver
   thee, when thou hast voluntarily given up to thine enemy those helps
   and means of preservation which have a thousand times their strength.
   Rest assuredly in this, that unless thou recover thyself with speed
   from this condition, the thing that thou fearest will come upon thee.
   What gospel principles do not, legal motives cannot do.

   5. When it is probable that there is, or may be, somewhat of judiciary
   hardness, or at least of chastening punishment, in thy lust as
   disquieting. This is another dangerous symptom. That God doth sometimes
   leave even those of his own under the perplexing power at least of some
   lust or sin, to correct them for former sins, negligence, and folly, I
   no way doubt. Hence was that complaint of the church, "Why hast thou
   hardened us from the fear of thy name?" Isa. lxiii. 17. That this is
   his way of dealing with unregenerate men no man questions. But how
   shall a man know whether there be any thing of God's chastening hand in
   his being left to the disquietment of his distemper? Ans. Examine thy
   heart and ways. What was the state and condition of thy soul before
   thou fellest into the entanglements of that sin which now thou so
   complainest of? Hadst thou been negligent in duties? Hadst thou lived
   inordinately to thyself? Is there the guilt of any great sin lying upon
   thee unrepented of? A new sin may be permitted, as well as a new
   affliction sent, to bring an old sin to remembrance.

   Hast thou received any eminent mercy, protection, deliverance, which
   thou didst not improve in a due manner, nor wast thankful for? or hast
   thou been exercised with any affliction without labouring for the
   appointed end of it? or hast thou been wanting to the opportunities of
   glorifying God in thy generation, which, in his good providence, he had
   graciously afforded unto thee? or hast thou conformed thyself unto the
   world and the men of it, through the abounding of temptations in the
   days wherein thou livest? If thou findest this to have been thy state,
   awake, call upon God; thou art fast asleep in a storm of anger round
   about thee.

   6. When thy lust hath already withstood particular dealings from God
   against it. This condition is described, Isa. lvii. 17, "For the
   iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and
   was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart." God had
   dealt with them about their prevailing lust, and that several ways, --
   by affliction and desertion; but they held out against all. This is a
   sad condition, which nothing but mere sovereign grace (as God expresses
   it in the next verse) can relieve a man in, and which no man ought to
   promise himself or bear himself upon. God oftentimes, in his
   providential dispensations, meets with a man, and speaks particularly
   to the evil of his heart, as he did to Joseph's brethren in their
   selling of him into Egypt. This makes the man reflect on his sin, and
   judge himself in particular for it. God makes it to be the voice of the
   danger, affliction, trouble, sickness that he is in or under. Sometimes
   in reading of the word God makes a man stay on something that cuts him
   to the heart, and shakes him as to his present condition. More
   frequently in the hearing of the word preached, his great ordinance for
   conviction, conversion, and edification, doth he meet with men. God
   often hews men by the sword of his word in that ordinance, strikes
   directly on their bosom-beloved lust, startles the sinner, makes him
   engage unto the mortification and relinquishment of the evil of his
   heart. Now, if his lust have taken such hold on him as to enforce him
   to break these bands of the Lord, and to cast these cords from him, --
   if it overcomes these convictions, and gets again into its old posture,
   -- if it can cure the wounds it so receives, -- that soul is in a sad
   condition.

   Unspeakable are the evils which attend such a frame of heart. Every
   particular warning to a man in such an estate is an inestimable mercy;
   how then doth he despise God in them who holds out against them! And
   what infinite patience is this in God, that he doth not cast off such a
   one, and swear in his wrath that he shall never enter into his rest!

   These and many other evidences are there of a lust that is dangerous,
   if not mortal. As our Saviour said of the evil spirit, "This kind goes
   not out but by fasting and prayer," so say I of lusts of this kind. An
   ordinary course of mortification will not do it; extraordinary ways
   must be fixed on.

   This is the first particular direction: Consider whether the lust or
   sin you are contending with hath any of these dangerous symptoms
   attending of it.

   Before I proceed I must give you one caution by the way, lest any be
   deceived by what hath been spoken. Whereas I say the things and evils
   above-mentioned may befall true believers, let not any that finds the
   same things in himself thence or from thence conclude that he is a true
   believer. These are the evils that believers may fall into and be
   ensnared withal, not the things that constitute a believer. A man may
   as well conclude that he is a believer because he is an adulterer,
   because David that was so fell into adultery, as conclude it from the
   signs foregoing; which are the evils of sin and Satan in the hearts of
   believers. The seventh chapter of the Romans contains the description
   of a regenerate man. He that shall consider what is spoken of his dark
   side, of his unregenerate part, of the indwelling power and violence of
   sin remaining in him, and, because he finds the like in himself,
   conclude that he is a regenerate man, will be deceived in his
   reckoning. It is all one as if you should argue: A wise man may be sick
   and wounded, yea, do some things foolishly; therefore, every one who is
   sick and wounded and does things foolishly is a wise man. Or as if a
   silly, deformed creature, hearing one speak of a beautiful person,
   should say that he had a mark or a scar that much disfigured him,
   should conclude that because he hath himself scars, and moles, and
   warts, he also is beautiful. If you will have evidences of your being
   believers, it must be from those things that constitute men believers.
   He that hath these things in himself may safely conclude, "If I am a
   believer, I am a most miserable one." But that any man is so, he must
   look for other evidences if he will have peace.

   The second particular direction: Get a clear sense of, -- 1. The guilt
   of the sin perplexing -- Considerations for help therein proposed -- 2.
   The danger manifold -- (1.) Hardening -- (2.) Temporal correction --
   (3.) Loss of peace and strength -- (4.) Eternal destruction -- Rules
   for the management of this consideration -- 3. The evil of it -- (1.)
   In grieving the Spirit -- (2.) Wounding the new creature -- [(3.)
   Taking away a man's usefulness.]

   The second direction is this: Get a clear and abiding sense upon thy
   mind and conscience of the guilt, danger, and evil of that sin
   wherewith thou art perplexed:--

   1. Of the guilt of it. It is one of the deceits of a prevailing lust to
   extenuate its own guilt. "Is it not a little one?" "When I go and bow
   myself in the house of Rimmon, God be merciful to me in this thing."
   "Though this be bad, yet it is not so bad as such and such an evil;
   others of the people of God have had such a frame; yea, what dreadful
   actual sins have some of them fallen into!" Innumerable ways there are
   whereby sin diverts the mind from a right and due apprehension of its
   guilt. Its noisome exhalations darken the mind, that it cannot make a
   right judgment of things. Perplexing reasonings, extenuating promises,
   tumultuating desires, treacherous purposes of relinquishment, hopes of
   mercy, all have their share in disturbing the mind in its consideration
   of the guilt of a prevailing lust. The prophet tells us that lust will
   do thus wholly when it comes to the height: Hos. iv. 11, "Whoredom and
   wine and new wine take away the heart," -- the heart, that is the
   understanding, as it is often used in the Scripture. And as they
   accomplish this work to the height in unregenerate persons, so in part
   in regenerate also. Solomon tells you of him who was enticed by the
   lewd woman, that he was "among the simple ones;" he was "a young man
   void of understanding," Prov. vii. 7. And wherein did his folly appear?
   Why, says he, in the 23d verse, "He knew not that it was for his life;"
   he considered not the guilt of the evil that he was involved in. And
   the Lord, rendering a reason why his dealings with Ephraim took no
   better effect, gives this account: "Ephraim is like a silly dove
   without heart," Hos. vii. 11; -- had no understanding of his own
   miserable condition. Had it been possible that David should have lain
   so long in the guilt of that abominable sin, but that he had
   innumerable corrupt reasonings, hindering him from taking a clear view
   of its ugliness and guilt in the glass of the law? This made the
   prophet that was sent for his awaking, in his dealings with him, to
   shut up all subterfuges and pretences by his parable, that so he might
   fall fully under a sense of the guilt of it. This is the proper issue
   of lust in the heart, -- it darkens the mind that it shall not judge
   aright of its guilt; and many other ways it hath for its own
   extenuation that I shall not now insist on.

   Let this, then, be the first care of him that would mortify sin, -- to
   fix a right judgment of its guilt in his mind. To which end take these
   considerations to thy assistance:--

   (1.) Though the power of sin be weakened by inherent grace in them that
   have it, that sin shall not have dominion over them as it hath over
   others, yet the guilt of sin that doth yet abide and remain is
   aggravated and heightened by it: Rom. vi. 1, 2, "What shall we say
   then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How
   shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" -- "How shall
   we, that are dead?" The emphasis is on the word "we." How shall we do
   it, who, as he afterward describes it, have received grace from Christ
   to the contrary? We, doubtless, are more evil than any, if we do it. I
   shall not insist on the special aggravations of the sins of such
   persons, -- how they sin against more love, mercy, grace, assistance,
   relief, means, and deliverances than others. But let this consideration
   abide in thy mind, -- there is inconceivably more evil and guilt in the
   evil of thy heart that doth remain, than there would be in so much sin
   if thou hadst no grace at all. Observe, --

   (2.) That as God sees abundance of beauty and excellency in the desires
   of the heart of his servants, more than in any the most glorious works
   of other men, yea, more than in most of their own outward performances,
   which have a greater mixture of sin than the desires and pantings of
   grace in the heart have; so God sees a great deal of evil in the
   working of lust in their hearts, yea, and more than in the open,
   notorious acts of wicked men, or in many outward sins whereinto the
   saints may fall, seeing against them there is more opposition made, and
   more humiliation generally follows them. Thus Christ, dealing with his
   decaying children, goes to the root with them, lays aside their
   profession: Rev. iii. 15, "I know thee;" -- "Thou art quite another
   thing than thou professest; and this makes thee abominable."

   So, then, let these things, and the like considerations, lead thee to a
   clear sense of the guilt of thy indwelling lust, that there may be no
   room in thy heart for extenuating or excusing thoughts, whereby sin
   insensibly will get strength and prevail.

   2. Consider the danger of it, which is manifold:--

   (1.) Of being hardened by the deceitfulness. This the apostle sorely
   charges on the Hebrews, chap. iii. 12, 13, "Take heed, brethren, lest
   there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the
   living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day;
   lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin." "Take
   heed," saith he, "use all means, consider your temptations, watch
   diligently; there is a treachery, a deceit in sin, that tends to the
   hardening of your hearts from the fear of God." The hardening here
   mentioned is to the utmost, -- utter obduration; sin tends to it, and
   every distemper and lust will make at least some progress towards it.
   Thou that wast tender, and didst use to melt under the word, under
   afflictions, wilt grow as some have profanely spoken, "sermon-proof and
   sickness-proof." Thou that didst tremble at the presence of God,
   thoughts of death, and appearance before him, when thou hadst more
   assurance of his love than now thou hast, shalt have a stoutness upon
   thy spirit not to be moved by these things. Thy soul and thy sin shall
   be spoken of and spoken to, and thou shalt not be at all concerned, but
   shalt be able to pass over duties, praying, hearing, reading, and thy
   heart not in the least affected. Sin will grow a light thing to thee;
   thou wilt pass it by as a thing of nought; this it will grow to. And
   what will be the end of such a condition? Can a sadder thing befall
   thee? Is it not enough to make any heart to tremble, to think of being
   brought into that estate wherein he should have slight thoughts of sin?
   Slight thoughts of grace, of mercy, of the blood of Christ, of the law,
   heaven, and hell, come all in at the same season. Take heed, this is
   that thy lust is working towards, -- the hardening of the heart,
   searing of the conscience, blinding of the mind, stupifying of the
   affections, and deceiving of the whole soul.

   (2.) The danger of some great temporal correction, which the Scripture
   calls "vengeance," "judgment," and "punishment." Ps. lxxxix. 30-33,
   Though God should not utterly cast thee off for this abomination that
   lies in thy heart, yet he will visit thee with the rod; though he
   pardon and forgive, he will take vengeance of thy inventions. O
   remember David and all his troubles! look on him flying into the
   wilderness, and consider the hand of God upon him. Is it nothing to
   thee that God should kill thy child in anger, ruin thy estate in anger,
   break thy bones in anger, suffer thee to be a scandal and reproach in
   anger, kill thee, destroy thee, make thee lie down in darkness, in
   anger? Is it nothing that he should punish, ruin, and undo others for
   thy sake? Let me not be mistaken. I do not mean that God doth send all
   these things always on his in anger; God forbid! but this I say, that
   when he doth so deal with thee, and thy conscience bears witness with
   him what thy provocations have been, thou wilt find his dealings full
   of bitterness to thy soul. If thou fearest not these things, I fear
   thou art under hardness.

   (3.) Loss of peace and strength all a man's days. To have peace with
   God, to have strength to walk before God, is the sum of the great
   promises of the covenant of grace. In these things is the life of our
   souls. Without them in some comfortable measure, to live is to die.
   What good will our lives do us if we see not the face of God sometimes
   in peace? if we have not some strength to walk with him? Now, both
   these will an unmortified lust certainly deprive the souls of men of.
   This case is so evident in David, as that nothing can be more clear.
   How often doth he complain that his bones were broken, his soul
   disquieted, his wounds grievous, on this account! Take other instances:
   Isa. lvii. 17, "For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth, and
   hid myself." What peace, I pray, is there to a soul while God hides
   himself, or strength whilst he smites? Hos. v. 15, "I will go and
   return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my
   face;" -- "I will leave them, hide my face, and what will become of
   their peace and strength?" If ever, then, thou hast enjoyed peace with
   God, if ever his terrors have made thee afraid, if ever thou hast had
   strength to walk with him, or ever hast mourned in thy prayer, and been
   troubled because of thy weakness, think of this danger that hangs over
   thy head. It is perhaps but a little while and thou shalt see the face
   of God in peace no more. Perhaps by to-morrow thou shalt not be able to
   pray, read, hear, or perform any duties with the least cheerfulness,
   life, or vigour; and possibly thou mayst never see a quiet hour whilst
   thou livest, -- that thou mayst carry about thee broken bones, full of
   pain and terror, all the days of thy life. Yea, perhaps God will shoot
   his arrows at thee, and fill thee with anguish and disquietness, with
   fears and perplexities; make thee a terror and an astonishment to
   thyself and others; show thee hell and wrath every moment; frighten and
   scare thee with sad apprehensions of his hatred; so that thy sore shall
   run in the night season, and thy soul shall refuse comfort; so that
   thou shalt wish death rather than life, yea, thy soul may choose
   strangling. Consider this a little, -- though God should not utterly
   destroy thee, yet he might cast thee into this condition, wherein thou
   shalt have quick and living apprehensions of thy destruction. Wont thy
   heart to thoughts hereof; let it know what is like to be the issue of
   its state. Leave not this consideration until thou hast made thy soul
   to tremble within thee.

   (4.) There is the danger of eternal destruction.

   For the due management of this consideration, observe, --

   [1.] That there is such a connection between a continuance in sin and
   eternal destruction, that though God does resolve to deliver some from
   a continuance in sin that they may not be destroyed, yet he will
   deliver none from destruction that continue in sin; so that whilst any
   one lies under an abiding power of sin, the threats of destruction and
   everlasting separation from God are to be held out to him. So Heb. iii.
   12; to which add chap. x. 38. This is the rule of God's proceeding: If
   any man "depart" from him, "draw back" through unbelief, "God's soul
   hath no pleasure in him;" -- "that is, his indignation shall pursue him
   to destruction:" so evidently, Gal. vi. 8.

   [2.] That he who is so entangled, as above described, under the power
   of any corruption, can have at that present no clear prevailing
   evidence of his interest in the covenant, by the efficacy whereof he
   may be delivered from fear of destruction; so that destruction from the
   Lord may justly be a terror to him; and he may, he ought to look upon
   it, as that which will be the end of his course and ways. "There is no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus," Rom. viii. 1. True; but
   who shall have the comfort of this assertion? who may assume it to
   himself? "They that walk after the Spirit, and not after the flesh."
   But you will say, "Is not this to persuade men to unbelief?" I answer,
   No. There is a twofold judgement that a man may make of himself, --
   first, of his person; and, secondly, of his ways. It is the judgement
   of his ways, not his person, that I speak of. Let a man get the best
   evidence for his person that he can, yet to judge that an evil way will
   end in destruction is his duty; not to do it is atheism. I do not say,
   that in such a condition a man ought to throw away the evidence of his
   personal interest in Christ; but I say, he cannot keep them. There is a
   twofold condemnation of a man's self:-- First, In respect of desert,
   when the soul concludes that it deserves to be cast out of the presence
   of God; and this is so far from a business of unbelief that it is an
   effect of faith. Secondly, With respect to the issue and event, when
   the soul concludes it shall be damned. I do not say this is the duty of
   any one, nor do I call them to it; but this I say, that the end of the
   way may be provoked to fly from it. And this is another consideration
   that ought to dwell upon such a soul, if it desire to be freed from the
   entanglement of its lusts.

   3. Consider the evils of it; I mean its present evils. Danger respects
   what is to come; evil, what is present. Some of the many evils that
   attend an unmortified lust may be mentioned:--

   (1.) It grieves the holy and blessed Spirit, which is given to
   believers to dwell in them and abide with them. So the apostle, Eph.
   iv. 25-29, dehorting them from many lusts and sins, gives this as the
   great motive of it, verse 30, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby ye
   are sealed unto the day of redemption." "Grieve not that Spirit of
   God," saith he, "whereby you receive so many and so great benefits;" of
   which he instances in one signal and comprehensive one,-- "sealing to
   the day of redemption." He is grieved by it. As a tender and loving
   friend is grieved at the unkindness of his friend, of whom he hath well
   deserved, so is it with this tender and loving Spirit, who hath chosen
   our hearts for a habitation to dwell in, and there to do for us all
   that our souls desire. He is grieved by our harbouring his enemies, and
   those whom he is to destroy, in our hearts with him. "He doth not
   afflict willingly, nor grieve us," Lam. iii. 33; and shall we daily
   grieve him? Thus is he said sometimes to be "vexed," sometimes "grieved
   at his heart," to express the greatest sense of our provocation. Now,
   if there be any thing of gracious ingenuity left in the soul, if it be
   not utterly hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, this consideration
   will certainly affect it. Consider who and what thou art; who the
   Spirit is that is grieved, what he hath done for thee, what he comes to
   thy soul about, what he hath already done in thee; and be ashamed.
   Among those who walk with God, there is no greater motive and incentive
   unto universal holiness, and the preserving of their hearts and spirits
   in all purity and cleanness, than this, that the blessed Spirit, who
   hath undertaken to dwell in them, is continually considering what they
   give entertainment in their hearts unto, and rejoiceth when his temple
   is kept undefiled. That was a high aggravation of the sin of Zimri,
   that he brought his adulteress into the congregation in the sight of
   Moses and the rest, who were weeping for the sins of the people, Numb.
   xxv. 6. And is it not a high aggravation of the countenancing of a
   lust, or suffering it to abide in the heart, when it is (as it must be,
   if we are believers) entertained under the peculiar eye and view of the
   Holy Ghost, taking care to preserve his tabernacle pure and holy?

   (2.) The Lord Jesus Christ is wounded afresh by it; his new creature in
   the heart is wounded; his love is foiled; his adversary gratified. As a
   total relinquishment of him, by the deceitfulness of sin, is the
   "crucifying him afresh, and the putting of him to open shame;" so every
   harbouring of sin that he came to destroy wounds and grieves him.

   (3.) It will take away a man's usefulness in his generation. His works,
   his endeavours, his labours, seldom receive blessing from God. If he be
   a preacher, God commonly blows upon his ministry, that he shall labour
   in the fire, and not be honoured with any success or doing any work for
   God; and the like may be spoken of other conditions. The world is at
   this day full of poor withering professors. How few are there that walk
   in any beauty or glory! how barren, how useless are they, for the most
   part! Amongst the many reasons that may be assigned of this sad estate,
   it may justly be feared that this is none of the least effectual, --
   many men harbour spirit-devouring lusts in their bosoms, that lie as
   worms at the root of their obedience, and corrode and weaken it day by
   day. All graces, all the ways and means whereby any graces may be
   exercised and improved, are prejudiced by this means; and as to any
   success, God blasts such men's undertakings.

   This, then, is my second direction, and it regards the opposition that
   is to be made to lust in respect of its habitual residence in the
   soul:-- Keep alive upon thy heart these or the like considerations of
   its guilt, danger, and evil; be much in the meditation of these things;
   cause thy heart to dwell and abide upon them; engage thy thoughts into
   these considerations; let them not go off nor wander from them until
   they begin to have a powerful influence upon thy soul, -- until they
   make it to tremble.

   The third direction proposed: Load thy conscience with the guilt of the
   perplexing distemper -- The ways and means whereby that may be done --
   The fourth direction: Vehement desire for deliverance -- The fifth:
   Some distempers rooted deeply in men's natural tempers --
   Considerations of such distempers; ways of dealing with them -- The
   sixth direction: Occasions and advantages of sin to be prevented -- The
   seventh direction: The first actings of sin vigorously to be opposed.

   This is my third direction, --

   Load thy conscience with the guilt of it. Not only consider that it
   hath a guilt, but load thy conscience with the guilt of its actual
   eruptions and disturbances.

   For the right improvement of this rule I shall give some particular
   directions:--

   1. Take God's method in it, and begin with generals, and so descend to
   particulars:--

   (1.) Charge thy conscience with that guilt which appears in it from the
   rectitude and holiness of the law. Bring the holy law of God into thy
   conscience, lay thy corruption to it, pray that thou mayst be affected
   with it. Consider the holiness, spirituality, fiery severity,
   inwardness, absoluteness of the law, and see how thou canst stand
   before it. Be much, I say, in affecting thy conscience with the terror
   of the Lord in the law, and how righteous it is that every one of thy
   transgressions should receive a recompense of reward. Perhaps thy
   conscience will invent shifts and evasions to keep off the power of
   this consideration; -- as, that the condemning power of the law doth
   not belong to thee, thou art set free from it, and the like; and so,
   though thou be not conformable to it, yet thou needest not to be so
   much troubled at it. But, --

   [1.] Tell thy conscience that it cannot manage any evidence to the
   purpose that thou art free from the condemning power of sin, whilst thy
   unmortified lust lies in thy heart; so that, perhaps, the law may make
   good its plea against thee for a full dominion, and then thou art a
   lost creature. Wherefore it is best to ponder to the utmost what it
   hath to say.

   Assuredly, he that pleads in the most secret reserve of his heart that
   he is freed from the condemning power of the law, thereby secretly to
   countenance himself in giving the least allowance unto any sin or lust,
   is not able, on gospel grounds, to manage any evidence, unto any
   tolerable spiritual security, that indeed he is in a due manner freed
   from what he so pretends himself to be delivered.

   [2.] Whatever be the issue, yet the law hath commission from God to
   seize upon transgressors wherever it find them, and so bring them
   before his throne, where they are to plead for themselves. This is thy
   present case; the law hath found thee out, and before God it will bring
   thee. If thou canst plead a pardon, well and good; if not, the law will
   do its work.

   [3.] However, this is the proper work of the law, to discover sin in
   the guilt of it, to awake and humble the soul for it, to be a glass to
   represent sin in its colours; and if thou deniest to deal with it on
   this account, it is not through faith, but through the hardness of thy
   heart and the deceitfulness of sin.

   This is a door that too many professors have gone out at unto open
   apostasy. Such a deliverance from the law they have pretended, as that
   they would consult its guidance and direction no more; they would
   measure their sin by it no more. By little and little this principle
   hath insensibly, from the notion of it, proceeded to influence their
   practical understandings, and, having taken possession there, hath
   turned the will and affections loose to all manner of abominations.

   By such ways, I say, then, as these, persuade thy conscience to hearken
   diligently to what the law speaks, in the name of the Lord, unto thee
   about thy lust and corruption. Oh! if thy ears be open, it will speak
   with a voice that shall make thee tremble, that shall cast thee to the
   ground, and fill thee with astonishment. If ever thou wilt mortify thy
   corruptions, thou must tie up thy conscience to the law, shut it from
   all shifts and exceptions, until it owns its guilt with a clear and
   thorough apprehension; so that thence, as David speaks, thy "iniquity
   may ever be before thee."

   (2.) Bring thy lust to the gospel, -- not for relief, but for farther
   conviction of its guilt; look on Him whom thou hast pierced, and be in
   bitterness. Say to thy soul, "What have I done? What love, what mercy,
   what blood, what grace have I despised and trampled on! Is this the
   return I make to the Father for his love, to the Son for his blood, to
   the Holy Ghost for his grace? Do I thus requite the Lord? Have I
   defiled the heart that Christ died to wash, that the blessed Spirit
   hath chosen to dwell in? And can I keep myself out of the dust? What
   can I say to the dear Lord Jesus? How shall I hold up my head with any
   boldness before him? Do I account communion with him of so little
   value, that for this vile lust's sake I have scarce left him any room
   in my heart? How shall I escape if I neglect so great salvation? In the
   meantime, what shall I say to the Lord? Love, mercy, grace, goodness,
   peace, joy, consolation, -- I have despised them all, and esteemed them
   as a thing of nought, that I might harbour a lust in my heart. Have I
   obtained a view of God's fatherly countenance, that I might behold his
   face and provoke him to his face? Was my soul washed, that room might
   be made for new defilements? Shall I endeavour to disappoint the end of
   the death of Christ? Shall I daily grieve that Spirit whereby I am
   sealed to the day of redemption?" Entertain thy conscience daily with
   this treaty. See if it can stand before this aggravation of its guilt.
   If this make it not sink in some measure and melt, I fear thy case is
   dangerous.

   2. Descend to particulars. As under the general head of the gospel all
   the benefits of it are to be considered, as redemption, justification,
   and the like; so, in particular, consider the management of the love of
   them towards thine own soul, for the aggravation of the guilt of thy
   corruption. As, --

   (1.) Consider the infinite patience and forbearance of God towards thee
   in particular. Consider what advantages he might have taken against
   thee, to have made thee a shame and a reproach in this world, and an
   object of wrath for ever; how thou hast dealt treacherously and falsely
   with him from time to time, flattered him with thy lips, but broken all
   promises and engagements, and that by the means of that sin thou art
   now in pursuit of; and yet he hath spared thee from time to time,
   although thou seemest boldly to have put it to the trial how long he
   could hold out. And wilt thou yet sin against him? wilt thou yet weary
   him, and make him to serve with thy corruptions?

   Hast thou not often been ready to conclude thyself, that it was utterly
   impossible that he should bear any longer with thee; that he would cast
   thee off, and be gracious no more; that all his forbearance was
   exhausted, and hell and wrath was even ready prepared for thee? and
   yet, above all thy expectation, he hath returned with visitations of
   love. And wilt thou yet abide in the provocation of the eyes of his
   glory?

   (2.) How often hast thou been at the door of being hardened by the
   deceitfulness of sin, and by the infinite rich grace of God hast been
   recovered to communion with him again?

   Hast thou not found grace decaying; delight in duties, ordinances,
   prayer and meditation, vanishing; inclinations to loose careless
   walking, thriving; and they who before were entangled, almost beyond
   recovery? Hast thou not found thyself engaged in such ways, societies,
   companies, and that with delight, as God abhors? And wilt thou venture
   any more to the brink of hardness?

   (3.) All God's gracious dealings with thee, in providential
   dispensations, deliverances, afflictions, mercies, enjoyments, all
   ought here to take place. By these, I say, and the like means, load thy
   conscience; and leave it not until it be thoroughly affected with the
   guilt of thy indwelling corruption, until it is sensible of its wound,
   and lie in the dust before the Lord. Unless this be done to the
   purpose, all other endeavours are to no purpose. Whilst the conscience
   hath any means to alleviate the guilt of sin, the soul will never
   vigorously attempt its mortification.

   Fourthly. Being thus affected with thy sin, in the next place get a
   constant longing, breathing after deliverance from the power of it.
   Suffer not thy heart one moment to be contented with thy present frame
   and condition. Longing desires after any thing, in things natural and
   civil, are of no value or consideration, any farther but as they incite
   and stir up the person in whom they are to a diligent use of means for
   the bringing about the thing aimed at. In spiritual things it is
   otherwise. Longing, breathing, and panting after deliverance is a grace
   in itself, that hath a mighty power to conform the soul into the
   likeness of the thing longed after. Hence the apostle, describing the
   repentance and godly sorrow of the Corinthians, reckons this as one
   eminent grace that was then set on work, "Vehement desire," 2 Cor. vii.
   11. And in this case of indwelling sin and the power of it, what frame
   doth he express himself to be in? Rom. vii. 24. His heart breaks out
   with longings into a most passionate expression of desire of
   deliverance. Now, if this be the frame of saints upon the general
   consideration of indwelling sin, how is it to be heightened and
   increased when thereunto is added the perplexing rage and power of any
   particular lust and corruption! Assure thyself, unless thou longest for
   deliverance thou shalt not have it.

   This will make the heart watchful for all opportunities of advantage
   against its enemy, and ready to close with any assistances that are
   afforded for its destruction. Strong desires are the very life of that
   "praying always" which is enjoined us in all conditions, and in none is
   more necessary than in this; they set faith and hope on work, and are
   the soul's moving after the Lord.

   Get thy heart, then, into a panting and breathing frame; long, sigh,
   cry out. You know the example of David; I shall not need to insist on
   it.

   The fifth direction is, --

   Consider whether the distemper with which thou art perplexed be not
   rooted in thy nature, and cherished, fomented, and heightened from thy
   constitution. A proneness to some sins may doubtless lie in the natural
   temper and disposition of men. In this case consider, --

   1. This is not in the least an extenuation of the guilt of thy sin.
   Some, with an open profaneness, will ascribe gross enormities to their
   temper and disposition; and whether others may not relieve themselves
   from the pressing guilt of their distempers by the same consideration,
   I know not. It is from the fall, from the original depravation of our
   natures, that the fomes and nourishment of any sin abides in our
   natural temper. David reckons his being shapen in iniquity and
   conception in sin [15] as an aggravation of his following sin, not a
   lessening or extenuation of it. That thou art peculiarly inclined unto
   any sinful distemper is but a peculiar breaking out of original lust in
   thy nature, which should peculiarly abase and humble thee.

   2. That thou hast to fix upon on this account, in reference to thy
   walking with God, is, that so great an advantage is given to sin, as
   also to Satan, by this thy temper and disposition, that without
   extraordinary watchfulness, care, and diligence, they will assuredly
   prevail against thy soul. Thousands have been on this account hurried
   headlong to hell, who otherwise, at least, might have gone at a more
   gentle, less provoking, less mischievous rate.

   3. For the mortification of any distemper so rooted in the nature of a
   man, unto all other ways and means already named or farther to be
   insisted on, there is one expedient peculiarly suited; this is that of
   the apostle, 1 Cor. ix. 27, "I keep under my body, and bring it into
   subjection." The bringing of the very body into subjection is an
   ordinance of God tending to the mortification of sin. This gives check
   unto the natural root of the distemper, and withers it by taking away
   its fatness of soil. Perhaps, because the Papists, men ignorant of the
   righteousness of Christ, the work of his Spirit, and whole business in
   hand, have laid the whole weight and stress of mortification in
   voluntary services and penances, leading to the subjection of the body,
   knowing indeed the true nature neither of sin nor mortification, it
   may, on the other side, be a temptation to some to neglect some means
   of humiliation which by God himself are owned and appointed. The
   bringing of the body into subjection in the case insisted on, by
   cutting short the natural appetite, by fasting, watching, and the like,
   is doubtless acceptable to God, so it be done with the ensuing
   limitations:--

   (1.) That the outward weakening and impairing of the body be not looked
   upon as a thing good in itself, or that any mortification doth consist
   therein, -- which were again to bring us under carnal ordinances; but
   only as a means for the end proposed, -- the weakening of any distemper
   in its natural root and seat. A man may have leanness of body and soul
   together.

   (2.) That the means whereby this is done, -- namely, by fasting and
   watching, and the like, -- be not looked on as things that in
   themselves, and by virtue of their own power, can produce true
   mortification of any sin; for if they would, sin might be mortified
   without any help of the Spirit in any unregenerate person in the world.
   They are to be looked on only as ways whereby the Spirit may, and
   sometimes doth, put forth strength for the accomplishing of his own
   work, especially in the case mentioned. Want of a right understanding
   and due improvement of these and the like considerations, hath raised a
   mortification among the Papists that may be better applied to horses
   and other beasts of the field than to believers.

   This is the sum of what hath been spoken: When the distemper complained
   of seems to be rooted in the natural temper and constitution, in
   applying our souls to a participation of the blood and Spirit of
   Christ, an endeavour is to be used to give check in the way of God to
   the natural root of that distemper.

   The sixth direction is, --

   Consider what occasions, what advantages thy distemper hath taken to
   exert and put forth itself, and watch against them all.

   This is one part of that duty which our blessed Saviour recommends to
   his disciples under the name of watching: Mark xiii. 37, "I say unto
   you all, Watch;" which, in Luke xxi. 34, is, "Take heed lest your
   hearts be overcharged." Watch against all eruptions of thy corruptions.
   I mean that duty which David professed himself to be exercised unto. "I
   have," saith he, "kept myself from mine iniquity." He watched all the
   ways and workings of his iniquity, to prevent them, to rise up against
   them. This is that which we are called unto under the name of
   "considering our ways." Consider what ways, what companies, what
   opportunities, what studies, what businesses, what conditions, have at
   any time given, or do usually give, advantages to thy distempers, and
   set thyself heedfully against them all. Men will do this with respect
   unto their bodily infirmities and distempers. The seasons, the diet,
   the air that have proved offensive shall be avoided. Are the things of
   the soul of less importance? Know that he that dares to dally with
   occasions of sin will dare to sin. He that will venture upon
   temptations unto wickedness will venture upon wickedness. Hazael
   thought he should not be so wicked as the prophet told him he would be.
   To convince him, the prophet tells him no more but, "Thou shalt be king
   of Syria." If he will venture on temptations unto cruelty, he will be
   cruel. Tell a man he shall commit such and such sins, he will startle
   at it. If you can convince him that he will venture on such occasions
   and temptations of them, he will have little ground left for his
   confidence. Particular directions belonging to this head are many, not
   now to be insisted on. But because this head is of no less importance
   than the whole doctrine here handled, I have at large in another
   treatise, about entering into temptations, treated of it.

   The seventh direction is, --

   Rise mightily against the first actings of thy distemper, its first
   conceptions; suffer it not to get the least ground. Do not say, "Thus
   far it shall go, and no farther." If it have allowance for one step, it
   will take another. It is impossible to fix bounds to sin. It is like
   water in a channel, -- if it once break out, it will have its course.
   Its not acting is easier to be compassed than its bounding. Therefore
   doth James give that gradation and process of lust, chap. i. 14, 15,
   that we may stop at the entrance. Dost thou find thy corruption to
   begin to entangle thy thoughts? rise up with all thy strength against
   it, with no less indignation than if it had fully accomplished what it
   aims at. Consider what an unclean thought would have; it would have
   thee roll thyself in folly and filth. Ask envy what it would have; --
   murder and destruction is at the end of it. Set thyself against it with
   no less vigour than if it had utterly debased thee to wickedness.
   Without this course thou wilt not prevail. As sin gets ground in the
   affections to delight in, it gets also upon the understanding to slight
   it.

   The eighth direction: Thoughtfulness of the excellency of the majesty
   of God -- Our unacquaintedness with him proposed and considered.

   Eighthly, Use and exercise thyself to such meditations as may serve to
   fill thee at all times with self-abasement and thoughts of thine own
   vileness; as, --

   1. Be much in thoughtfulness of the excellency of the majesty of God
   and thine infinite, inconceivable distance from him. Many thoughts of
   it cannot but fill thee with a sense of thine own vileness, which
   strikes deep at the root of any indwelling sin. When Job comes to a
   clear discovery of the greatness and the excellency of God, he is
   filled with self-abhorrence and is pressed to humiliation, Job xlii. 5,
   6. And in what state doth the prophet Habakkuk affirm himself to be
   cast, upon the apprehension of the majesty of God? chap. iii. 16. "With
   God," says Job, "is terrible majesty." [16] Hence were the thoughts of
   them of old, that when they had seen God they should die. The Scripture
   abounds in this self-abasing consideration, comparing the men of the
   earth to "grasshoppers," to "vanity," the "dust of the balance," in
   respect of God. [17] Be much in thoughts of this nature, to abase the
   pride of thy heart, and to keep thy soul humble within thee. There is
   nothing will render thee a greater indisposition to be imposed on by
   the deceits of sin than such a frame of heart. Think greatly of the
   greatness of God.

   2. Think much of thine unacquaintedness with him. Though thou knowest
   enough to keep thee low and humble, yet how little a portion is it that
   thou knowest of him! The contemplation hereof cast that wise man into
   that apprehension of himself which he expresses, Prov. xxx. 2-4,
   "Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding
   of a man. I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
   Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the
   wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath
   established the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his
   Son's name, if thou canst tell?" Labour with this also to take down the
   pride of thy heart. What dost thou know of God? How little a portion is
   it! How immense is he in his nature! Canst thou look without terror
   into the abyss of eternity? Thou canst not bear the rays of his
   glorious being.

   Because I look on this consideration of great use in our walking with
   God, so far as it may have a consistency with that filial boldness
   which is given us in Jesus Christ to draw nigh to the throne of grace,
   I shall farther insist upon it, to give an abiding impression of it to
   the souls of them who desire to walk humbly with God.

   Consider, then, I say, to keep thy heart in continual awe of the
   majesty of God, that persons of the most high and eminent attainment,
   of the nearest and most familiar communion with God, do yet in this
   life know but a very little of him and his glory. God reveals his name
   to Moses, -- the most glorious attributes that he hath manifested in
   the covenant of grace, Exod. xxxiv. 5, 6; yet all are but the "back
   parts" of God. All that he knows by it is but little, low, compared to
   the perfections of his glory. Hence it is with peculiar reference to
   Moses that it is said, "No man hath seen God at any time," John i. 18;
   of him in comparison with Christ doth he speak, verse 17; and of him it
   is here said, "No man," no, not Moses, the most eminent among them,
   "hath seen God at any time." We speak much of God, can talk of him, his
   ways, his works, his counsels, all the day long; the truth is, we know
   very little of him. Our thoughts, our meditations, our expressions of
   him are low, many of them unworthy of his glory, none of them reaching
   his perfections.

   You will say that Moses was under the law when God wrapped up himself
   in darkness, and his mind in types and clouds and dark institutions; --
   under the glorious shining of the gospel, which hath brought life and
   immortality to light, God being revealed from his own bosom, we now
   know him much more clearly, and as he is; we see his face now, and not
   his back parts only, as Moses did.

   Ans. 1. I acknowledge a vast and almost inconceivable difference
   between the acquaintance we now have with God, after his speaking to us
   by his own Son, [18] and that which the generality of the saints had
   under the law; for although their eyes were as good, sharp, and clear
   as ours, their faith and spiritual understanding not behind ours, the
   object as glorious unto them as unto us, yet our day is more clear than
   theirs was, the clouds are blown away and scattered, [19] the shadows
   of the night are gone and fled away, the sun is risen, and the means of
   sight is made more eminent and clear than formerly. Yet, --

   2. That peculiar sight which Moses had of God, Exod. xxxiv., was a
   gospel-sight, a sight of God as "gracious," etc., and yet it is called
   but his "back parts;" that is, but low and mean, in comparison of his
   excellencies and perfections.

   3. The apostle, exalting to the utmost this glory of light above that
   of the law, manifesting that now the "vail" causing darkness is taken
   away, so that with "open" or uncovered "face [20] we behold the glory
   of the Lord," tells us how: "As in a glass," 2 Cor. iii. 18. "In a
   glass," how is that? Clearly, perfectly? Alas, no! He tells you how
   that is, 1 Cor. xiii. 12, "We see through a glass, darkly," saith he.
   It is not a telescope that helps us to see things afar off, concerning
   which the apostle speaks; and yet what poor helps are they! how short
   do we come of the truth of things notwithstanding their assistance! It
   is a looking-glass whereunto he alludes (where are only obscure species
   and images of things, and not the things themselves), and a sight
   therein that he compares our knowledge to. He tells you also that all
   that we do see, di' esuptrou , "by" or "through this glass," is in
   ainigmati -- in "a riddle," in darkness and obscurity. And speaking of
   himself, who surely was much more clear-sighted than any now living, he
   tells us that he saw but ek merous, -- "in part." He saw but the back
   parts of heavenly things, verse 12, and compares all the knowledge he
   had attained of God to that he had of things when he was a child, verse
   11. It is a meros, short of the to teleion; yea, such as
   katargethesetai , -- "it shall be destroyed," or done away. We know
   what weak, feeble, uncertain notions and apprehensions children have of
   things of any abstruse consideration; how when they grow up with any
   improvements of parts and abilities, those conceptions vanish, and they
   are ashamed of them. It is the commendation of a child to love, honour,
   believe, and obey his father; but for his science and notions, his
   father knows his childishness and folly. Notwithstanding all our
   confidence of high attainments, all our notions of God are but childish
   in respect of his infinite perfections. We lisp and babble, and say we
   know not what, for the most part, in our most accurate, as we think,
   conceptions and notions of God. We may love, honour, believe, and obey
   our Father; and therewith he accepts our childish thoughts, for they
   are but childish. We see but his back parts; we know but little of him.
   Hence is that promise wherewith we are so often supported and comforted
   in our distress, "We shall see him as he is;" we shall see him "face to
   face;" "know as we are known; comprehend that for which we are
   comprehended," 1 Cor. xiii. 12, 1 John iii. 2; and positively, "Now we
   see him not;" -- all concluding that here we see but his back parts;
   not as he is, but in a dark, obscure representation; not in the
   perfection of his glory.

   The queen of Sheba had heard much of Solomon, and framed many great
   thoughts of his magnificence in her mind thereupon; but when she came
   and saw his glory, she was forced to confess that the one half of the
   truth had not been told her. We may suppose that we have here attained
   great knowledge, clear and high thoughts of God; but, alas! when he
   shall bring us into his presence we shall cry out, "We never knew him
   as he is; the thousandth part of his glory, and perfection, and
   blessedness, never entered into our hearts."

   The apostle tells us, 1 John iii. 2, that we know not what we ourselves
   shall be, -- what we shall find ourselves in the issue; much less will
   it enter into our hearts to conceive what God is, and what we shall
   find him to be. Consider either him who is to be known, or the way
   whereby we know him, and this will farther appear:--

   (1.) We know so little of God, because it is God who is thus to be
   known, -- that is, he who hath described himself to us very much by
   this, that we cannot know him. What else doth he intend where he calls
   himself invisible, incomprehensible, and the like? -- that is, he whom
   we do not, cannot, know as he is. And our farther progress consists
   more in knowing what he is not, than what he is. Thus is he described
   to be immortal, infinite, -- that is, he is not, as we are, mortal,
   finite, and limited. Hence is that glorious description of him, 1 Tim.
   vi. 16, "Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man
   can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see." His light is
   such as no creature can approach unto. He is not seen, not because he
   cannot be seen, but because we cannot bear the sight of him. The light
   of God, in whom is no darkness, forbids all access to him by any
   creature whatever. We who cannot behold the sun in its glory are too
   weak to bear the beams of infinite brightness. On this consideration,
   as was said, the wise man professeth himself "a very beast, and not to
   have the understanding of a man," Prov. xxx. 2; -- that is, he knew
   nothing in comparison of God; so that he seemed to have lost all his
   understanding when once he came to the consideration of him, his work,
   and his ways.

   In this consideration let our souls descend to some particulars:--

   [1.] For the being of God; we are so far from a knowledge of it, so as
   to be able to instruct one another therein by words and expressions of
   it, as that to frame any conceptions in our mind, with such species and
   impressions of things as we receive the knowledge of all other things
   by, is to make an idol to ourselves, and so to worship a god of our own
   making, and not the God that made us. We may as well and as lawfully
   hew him out of wood or stone as form him a being in our minds, suited
   to our apprehensions. The utmost of the best of our thoughts of the
   being of God is, that we can have no thoughts of it. Our knowledge of a
   being is but low when it mounts no higher but only to know that we know
   it not.

   [2.] There be some things of God which he himself hath taught us to
   speak of, and to regulate our expressions of them; but when we have so
   done, we see not the things themselves; we know them not. To believe
   and admire is all that we attain to. We profess, as we are taught, that
   God is infinite, omnipotent, eternal; and we know what disputes and
   notions there are about omnipresence, immensity, infiniteness, and
   eternity. We have, I say, words and notions about these things; but as
   to the things themselves what do we know? what do we comprehend of
   them? Can the mind of man do any more but swallow itself up in an
   infinite abyss, which is as nothing; give itself up to what it cannot
   conceive, much less express? Is not our understanding "brutish" in the
   contemplation of such things, and is as if it were not? Yea, the
   perfection of our understanding is, not to understand, and to rest
   there. They are but the back parts of eternity and infiniteness that we
   have a glimpse of. What shall I say of the Trinity, or the subsistence
   of distinct persons in the same individual essence, -- a mystery by
   many denied, because by none understood, -- a mystery, whose every
   letter is mysterious? Who can declare the generation of the Son, the
   procession of the Spirit, or the difference of the one from the other?
   But I shall not farther instance in particulars. That infinite and
   inconceivable distance that is between him and us keeps us in the dark
   as to any sight of his face or clear apprehension of his perfections.

   We know him rather by what he does than by what he is, -- by his doing
   us good than by his essential goodness; and how little a portion of
   him, as Job speaks, is hereby discovered!

   (2.) We know little of God, because it is faith alone whereby here we
   know him. I shall not now discourse about the remaining impressions on
   the hearts of all men by nature that there is a God, nor what they may
   rationally be taught concerning that God from the works of his creation
   and providence, which they see and behold. It is confessedly, and that
   upon the woful experience of all ages, so weak, low, dark, confused,
   that none ever on that account glorified God as they ought, but,
   notwithstanding all their knowledge of God, were indeed "without God in
   the world."

   The chief, and, upon the matter, almost only acquaintance we have with
   God, and his dispensations of himself, is by faith. "He that cometh to
   God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him," Heb. xi. 6. Our knowledge of him and his
   rewarding (the bottom of our obedience or coming to him), is believing.
   "We walk by faith, and not by sight," 2 Cor. v. 7; -- Dia pisteos ou
   dia eidous; by faith, and so by faith as not to have any express idea,
   image, or species of that which we believe. Faith is all the argument
   we have of "things not seen," Heb. xi. 1. I might here insist upon the
   nature of it; and from all its concomitants and concernments manifest
   that we know but the back parts of what we know by faith only. As to
   its rise, it is built purely upon the testimony of Him whom we have not
   seen: as the apostle speaks, "How can ye love him whom ye have not
   seen?" -- that is, whom you know not but by faith that he is. Faith
   receives all upon his testimony, whom it receives to be only on his own
   testimony. As to its nature, it is an assent upon testimony, not an
   evidence upon demonstration; and the object of it is, as was said
   before, above us. Hence our faith, as was formerly observed, is called
   a "seeing darkly, as in a glass." All that we know this way (and all
   that we know of God we know this way) is but low, and dark, and
   obscure.

   But you will say, "All this is true, but yet it is only so to them that
   know not God, perhaps, as he is revealed in Jesus Christ; with them who
   do so it is otherwise. It is true, No man hath seen God at any time,'
   but the only-begotten Son, he hath revealed him,' John i. 18; and the
   Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may
   know him that is true,' 1 John v. 20. The illumination of the glorious
   gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,' shineth upon believers, 2
   Cor. iv. 4; yea, and God, who commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness, shines into their hearts, to give them the knowledge of his
   glory in the face of his Son,' verse 6. So that though we were
   darkness,' yet we are now light in the Lord,' Eph. v. 8. And the
   apostle says, We all with open face behold the glory of the Lord,' 2
   Cor. iii. 18; and we are now so far from being in such darkness, or at
   such a distance from God, that our communion and fellowship is with the
   Father and with his Son,' 1 John i. 3. The light of the gospel whereby
   now God is revealed is glorious; not a star, but the sun in his beauty
   is risen upon us, and the vail is taken from our faces. So that though
   unbelievers, yea, and perhaps some weak believers, may be in some
   darkness, yet those of any growth or considerable attainments have a
   clear sight and view of the face of God in Jesus Christ."

   To which I answer, --

   [1.] The truth is, we all of us know enough of him to love him more
   than we do, to delight in him and serve him, believe him, obey him, put
   our trust in him, above all that we have hitherto attained. Our
   darkness and weakness is no plea for our negligence and disobedience.
   Who is it that hath walked up to the knowledge that he hath had of the
   perfections, excellencies, and will of God? God's end in giving us any
   knowledge of himself here is that we may "glorify him as God;" that is,
   love him, serve him, believe and obey him, -- give him all the honour
   and glory that is due from poor sinful creatures to a sin-pardoning God
   and Creator. We must all acknowledge that we were never thoroughly
   transformed into the image of that knowledge which we have had. And had
   we used our talents well, we might have been trusted with more.

   [2.] Comparatively, that knowledge which we have of God by the
   revelation of Jesus Christ in the gospel is exceeding eminent and
   glorious. It is so in comparison of any knowledge of God that might
   otherwise be attained, or was delivered in the law under the Old
   Testament, which had but the shadow of good things, not the express
   image of them; this the apostle pursues at large, 2 Cor. iii. Christ
   hath now in these last days revealed the Father from his own bosom,
   declared his name, made known his mind, will, and counsel in a far more
   clear, eminent, distinct manner than he did formerly, whilst he kept
   his people under the pedagogy of the law; and this is that which, for
   the most part, is intended in the places before mentioned. The clear,
   perspicuous delivery and declaration of God and his will in the gospel
   is expressly exalted in comparison of any other way of revelation of
   himself.

   [3.] The difference between believers and unbelievers as to knowledge
   is not so much in the matter of their knowledge as in the manner of
   knowing. Unbelievers, some of them, may know more and be able to say
   more of God, his perfections, and his will, than many believers; but
   they know nothing as they ought, nothing in a right manner, nothing
   spiritually and savingly, nothing with a holy, heavenly light. The
   excellency of a believer is, not that he hath a large apprehension of
   things, but that what he doth apprehend, which perhaps may be very
   little, he sees it in the light of the Spirit of God, in a saving,
   soul-transforming light; and this is that which gives us communion with
   God, and not prying thoughts or curious-raised notions.

   [4.] Jesus Christ by his word and Spirit reveals to the hearts of all
   his, God as a Father, as a God in covenant, as a rewarder, every way
   sufficiently to teach us to obey him here, and to lead us to his bosom,
   to lie down there in the fruition of him to eternity. But yet now,

   [5.] Notwithstanding all this, it is but a little portion we know of
   him; we see but his back parts. For, --

   1st. The intendment of all gospel revelation is, not to unvail God's
   essential glory, that we should see him as he is, but merely to declare
   so much of him as he knows sufficient to be a bottom of our faith,
   love, obedience, and coming to him, -- that is, of the faith which here
   he expects from us; such services as beseem poor creatures in the midst
   of temptations. But when he calls us to eternal admiration and
   contemplation, without interruption, he will make a new manner of
   discovery of himself, and the whole shape of things, as it now lies
   before us, will depart as a shadow.

   2dly. We are dull and slow of heart to receive the things that are in
   the word revealed; God, by our infirmity and weakness, keeping us in
   continual dependence on him for teachings and revelations of himself
   out of his word, never in this world bringing any soul to the utmost of
   what is from the word to be made out and discovered: so that although
   the way of revelation in the gospel be clear and evident, yet we know
   little of the things themselves that are revealed.

   Let us, then, revive the use and intendment of this consideration: Will
   not a due apprehension of this inconceivable greatness of God, and that
   infinite distance wherein we stand from him, fill the soul with a holy
   and awful fear of him, so as to keep it in a frame unsuited to the
   thriving or flourishing of any lust whatever? Let the soul be
   continually wonted to reverential thoughts of God's greatness and
   omnipresence, and it will be much upon its watch as to any undue
   deportments. Consider him with whom you have to do, -- even "our God is
   a consuming fire;" and in your greatest abashments at his presence and
   eye, know that your very nature is too narrow to bear apprehensions
   suitable to his essential glory.

                                 Chapter XIII.

   The ninth direction: When the heart is disquieted by sin, speak no
   peace to it until God speak it -- Peace, without detestation of sin,
   unsound; so is peace measured out unto ourselves -- How we may know
   when we measure our peace unto ourselves -- Directions as to that
   inquiry -- The vanity of speaking peace slightly; also of doing it on
   one singular account, not universally.

   Ninethly, In case God disquiet the heart about the guilt of its
   distempers, either in respect of its root and indwelling, or in respect
   of any eruptions of it, take heed thou speakest not peace to thyself
   before God speaks it; but hearken what he says to thy soul. This is our
   next direction, without the observation whereof the heart will be
   exceedingly exposed to the deceitfulness of sin.

   This is a business of great importance. It is a sad thing for a man to
   deceive his own soul herein. All the warnings God gives us, in
   tenderness to our souls, to try and examine ourselves, do tend to the
   preventing of this great evil of speaking peace groundlessly to
   ourselves; which is upon the issue to bless ourselves, in an opposition
   to God. It is not my business to insist upon the danger of it, but to
   help believers to prevent it, and to let them know when they do so.

   To manage this direction aright observe, --

   1. That as it is the great prerogative and sovereignty of God to give
   grace to whom he pleases ("He hath mercy on whom he will," Rom. ix. 18;
   and among all the sons of men, he calls whom he will, and sanctifies
   whom he will), so among those so called and justified, and whom he will
   save, he yet reserves this privilege to himself, to speak peace to whom
   he pleaseth, and in what degree he pleaseth, even amongst them on whom
   he hath bestowed grace. He is the "God of all consolation," in an
   especial manner in his dealing with believers; that is, of the good
   things that he keeps locked up in his family, and gives out of it to
   all his children at his pleasure. This the Lord insists on, Isa. lvii.
   16-18. It is the case under consideration that is there insisted on.
   When God says he will heal their breaches and disconsolations, he
   assumes this privilege to himself in an especial manner: "I create it,"
   verse 19; -- "Even in respect of these poor wounded creatures I create
   it, and according to my sovereignty make it out as I please."

   Hence, as it is with the collation of grace in reference to them that
   are in the state of nature, -- God doth it in great curiosity, and his
   proceedings therein in taking and leaving, as to outward appearances,
   quite besides and contrary ofttimes to all probable expectations; so is
   it in his communications of peace and joy in reference unto them that
   are in the state of grace, -- he gives them out ofttimes quite besides
   our expectation, as to any appearing grounds of his dispensations.

   2. As God creates it for whom he pleaseth, so it is the prerogative of
   Christ to speak it home to the conscience. Speaking to the church of
   Laodicea, who had healed her wounds falsely, and spoke peace to herself
   when she ought not, he takes to himself that title, "I am the Amen, the
   faithful Witness," Rev. iii. 14. He bears testimony concerning our
   condition as it is indeed. We may possibly mistake, and trouble
   ourselves in vain, or flatter ourselves upon false grounds, but he is
   the "Amen, the faithful Witness;" and what he speaks of our state and
   condition, that it is indeed. Isa. xi. 3, He is said not to "judge
   after the sight of his eyes," -- not according to any outward
   appearance, or any thing that may be subject to a mistake, as we are
   apt to do; but he shall judge and determine every cause as it is
   indeed.

   Take these two previous observations, and I shall give some rules
   whereby men may know whether God speaks peace to them, or whether they
   speak peace to themselves only:--

   1. Men certainly speak peace to themselves when their so doing is not
   attended with the greatest detestation imaginable of that sin in
   reference whereunto they do speak peace to themselves, and abhorrency
   of themselves for it. When men are wounded by sin, disquieted and
   perplexed, and knowing that there is no remedy for them but only in the
   mercies of God, through the blood of Christ, do therefore look to him,
   and to the promises of the covenant in him, and thereupon quiet their
   hearts that it shall be well with them, and that God will be exalted,
   that he may be gracious to them, and yet their souls are not wrought to
   the greatest detestation of the sin or sins upon the account whereof
   they are disquieted, -- this is to heal themselves, and not to be
   healed of God. This is but a great and strong wind, that the Lord is
   nigh unto, but the Lord is not in the wind. When men do truly "look
   upon Christ whom they have pierced," without which there is no healing
   or peace, they will "mourn," Zech. xii. 10; they will mourn for him,
   even upon this account, and detest the sin that pierced him. When we go
   to Christ for healing, faith eyes him peculiarly as one pierced. Faith
   takes several views of Christ, according to the occasions of address to
   him and communion with him that it hath. Sometimes it views his
   holiness, sometimes his power, sometimes his love, [sometimes] his
   favour with his Father. And when it goes for healing and peace, it
   looks especially on the blood of the covenant, on his sufferings; for
   "with his stripes we are healed, and the chastisement of our peace was
   upon him," Isa. liii. 5. When we look for healing, his stripes are to
   be eyed, -- not in the outward story of them, which is the course of
   popish devotionists, but in the love, kindness, mystery, and design of
   the cross; and when we look for peace, his chastisements must be in our
   eye. Now this, I say, if it be done according to the mind of God, and
   in the strength of that Spirit which is poured out on believers, it
   will beget a detestation of that sin or sins for which healing and
   peace is sought. So Ezek. xvi. 60, 61, "Nevertheless I will remember my
   covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto
   thee an everlasting covenant." And what then? "Then thou shalt remember
   thy ways, and be ashamed." When God comes home to speak peace in a sure
   covenant of it, it fills the soul with shame for all the ways whereby
   it hath been alienated from him. And one of the things that the apostle
   mentions as attending that godly sorrow which is accompanied with
   repentance unto salvation, never to be repented of, is revenge: "Yea,
   what revenge!" 2 Cor. vii. 11. They reflected on their miscarriages
   with indignation and revenge, for their folly in them. When Job comes
   up to a thorough healing, he cries, "Now I abhor myself," Job xlii. 6;
   and until he did so, he had no abiding peace. He might perhaps have
   made up himself with that doctrine of free grace which was so
   excellently preached by Elihu, chap. xxxiii. from verse 14 unto 30; but
   he had then but skinned his wounds: he must come to self-abhorrency if
   he come to healing. So was it with those in Ps. lxxviii. 33-35, in
   their great trouble and perplexity, for and upon the account of sin. I
   doubt not but upon the address they made to God in Christ (for that so
   they did is evident from the titles they gave him; they call him their
   Rock and their Redeemer, two words everywhere pointing out the Lord
   Christ), they spake peace to themselves; but was it sound and abiding?
   No; it passed away as the early dew. God speaks not one word of peace
   to their souls. But why had they not peace? Why, because in their
   address to God, they flattered him. But how doth that appear? Verse 37:
   "Their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast;" they
   had not a detestation nor relinquishment of that sin in reference
   whereunto they spake peace to themselves. Let a man make what
   application he will for healing and peace, let him do it to the true
   Physician, let him do it the right way, let him quiet his heart in the
   promises of the covenant; yet, when peace is spoken, if it be not
   attended with the detestation and abhorrency of that sin which was the
   wound and caused the disquietment, this is no peace of God's creating,
   but of our own purchasing. It is but a skinning over the wound, whilst
   the core lies at the bottom, which will putrefy, and corrupt, and
   corrode, until it break out again with noisomeness, vexation, and
   danger. Let not poor souls that walk in such a path as this, who are
   more sensible of the trouble of sin than of the pollution of
   uncleanness that attends it; who address themselves for mercy, yea, to
   the Lord in Christ they address themselves for mercy, but yet will keep
   the sweet morsel of their sin under their tongue; -- let them, I say,
   never think to have true and solid peace. For instance, thou findest
   thy heart running out after the world, and it disturbs thee in thy
   communion with God; the Spirit speaks expressly to thee, -- "He that
   loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him." [21] This puts
   thee on dealing with God in Christ for the healing of thy soul, the
   quieting of thy conscience; but yet, withal, a thorough detestation of
   the evil itself abides not upon thee; yea, perhaps that is liked well
   enough, but only in respect of the consequences of it. Perhaps thou
   mayst be saved, yet as through fire, and God will have some work with
   thee before he hath done; but thou wilt have little peace in this life,
   -- thou wilt be sick and fainting all thy days, Isa. lvii. 17. This is
   a deceit that lies at the root of the peace of many professors and
   wastes it. They deal with all their strength about mercy and pardon,
   and seem to have great communion with God in their so doing; they lie
   before him, bewail their sins and follies, that any one would think,
   yea, they think themselves, that surely they and their sins are now
   parted; and so receive in mercy that satisfies their hearts for a
   little season. But when a thorough search comes to be made, there hath
   been some secret reserve for the folly or follies treated about, -- at
   least, there hath not been that thorough abhorrency of it which is
   necessary; and their whole peace is quickly discovered to be weak and
   rotten, scarce abiding any longer than the words of begging it are in
   their mouths.

   2. When men measure out peace to themselves upon the conclusions that
   their convictions and rational principles will carry them out unto,
   this is a false peace, and will not abide. I shall a little explain
   what I mean hereby. A man hath got a wound by sin; he hath a conviction
   of some sin upon his conscience; he hath not walked uprightly as
   becometh the gospel; all is not well and right between God and his
   soul. He considers now what is to be done. Light he hath, and knows
   what path he must take, and how his soul hath been formerly healed.
   Considering that the promises of God are the outward means of
   application for the healing of his sores and quieting of his heart, he
   goes to them, searches them out, finds out some one or more of them
   whose literal expressions are directly suited to his condition. Says he
   to himself, "God speaks in this promise; here I will take myself a
   plaster as long and broad as my wound;" and so brings the word of the
   promise to his condition, and sets him down in peace. This is another
   appearance upon the mount; the Lord is near, but the Lord is not in it.
   It hath not been the work of the Spirit, who alone can "convince us of
   sin, and righteousness, and judgment," [22] but the mere actings of the
   intelligent, rational soul. As there are three sorts of lives, we say,
   -- the vegetative, the sensitive, and the rational or intelligent, --
   some things have only the vegetative; some the sensitive also, and that
   includes the former; some have the rational, which takes in and
   supposes both the other. Now, he that hath the rational doth not only
   act suitably to that principle, but also to both the others, -- he
   grows and is sensible. It is so with men in the things of God. Some are
   mere natural and rational men; some have a superadded conviction with
   illumination; and some are truly regenerate. Now, he that hath the
   latter hath also both the former; and therefore he acts sometimes upon
   the principles of the rational, sometimes upon the principles of the
   enlightened man. His true spiritual life is not the principle of all
   his motions; he acts not always in the strength thereof, neither are
   all his fruits from that root. In this case that I speak of, he acts
   merely upon the principle of conviction and illumination, whereby his
   first naturals are heightened; but the Spirit breathes not at all upon
   all these waters. Take an instance: Suppose the wound and disquiet of
   the soul to be upon the account of relapses, -- which, whatever the
   evil or folly be, though for the matter of it never so small, yet there
   are no wounds deeper than those that are given the soul on that
   account, nor disquietments greater; -- in the perturbation of his mind,
   he finds out that promise, Isa. lv. 7, "The Lord will have mercy, and
   our God will abundantly pardon," -- he will multiply or add to pardon,
   he will do it again and again; or that in Hos. xiv. 4, "I will heal
   their backsliding, I will love them freely." This the man considers,
   and thereupon concludes peace to himself; whether the Spirit of God
   make the application or no, whether that gives life and power to the
   letter or no, that he regards not. He doth not hearken whether God the
   Lord speak peace. He doth not wait upon God, who perhaps yet hides his
   face, and sees the poor creature stealing peace and running away with
   it, knowing that the time will come when he will deal with him again,
   and call him to a new reckoning; [23] when he shall see that it is in
   vain to go one step where God doth not take him by the hand.

   I see here, indeed, sundry other questions upon this arising and
   interposing themselves. I cannot apply myself to them all: one I shall
   a little speak to.

   It may be said, then, "Seeing that this seems to be the path that the
   Holy Spirit leads us in for the healing of our wounds and quieting of
   our hearts, how shall we know when we go alone ourselves, and when the
   Spirit also doth accompany us?"

   Ans. (1.) If any of you are out of the way upon this account, God will
   speedily let you know it; for besides that you have his promise, that
   the "meek he will guide in judgment and teach them his way," Ps. xxv.
   9, he will not let you always err. He will, I say, not suffer your
   nakedness to be covered with fig-leaves, but take them away and all the
   peace you have in them, and will not suffer you to settle on such lees.
   You shall quickly know your wound is not healed; that is, you shall
   speedily know whether or no it be thus with you by the event. The peace
   you thus get and obtain will not abide. Whilst the mind is overpowered
   by its own convictions, there is no hold for disquietments to fix upon.
   Stay a little, and all these reasonings will grow cold and vanish
   before the face of the first temptation that arises. But, --

   (2.) This course is commonly taken without waiting; which is the grace,
   and that peculiar acting of faith which God calls for, to be exercised
   in such a condition. I know God doth sometimes come in upon the soul
   instantly, in a moment, as it were, wounding and healing it, -- as I am
   persuaded it was in the case of David, when he cut off the lap of
   Saul's garment; but ordinarily, in such a case, God calls for [24]
   waiting and labouring, attending as the eye of a servant upon his
   master. Says the prophet Isaiah, chap. viii. 17, "I will wait upon the
   Lord, who hideth his face from the house of Jacob." God will have his
   children lie a while at his door when they have run from his house, and
   not instantly rush in upon him; unless he take them by the hand and
   pluck them in, when they are so ashamed that they dare not come to him.
   Now, self-healers, or men that speak peace to themselves, do commonly
   make haste; they will not tarry; they do not hearken what God speaks,
   but on they will go to be healed. [25]

   (3.) Such a course, though it may quiet the conscience and the mind,
   the rational concluding part of the soul, yet it doth not sweeten the
   heart with rest and gracious contentation. The answer it receives is
   much like that Elisha gave Naaman, "Go in peace;" [26] it quieted his
   mind, but I much question whether it sweetened his heart, or gave him
   any joy in believing, other than the natural joy that was then stirred
   in him upon his healing. "Do not my words do good?" saith the Lord,
   Micah ii. 7. When God speaks, there is not only truth in his words,
   that may answer the conviction of our understandings, but also they do
   good; they bring that which is sweet, and good, and desirable to the
   will and affections; by them the "soul returns unto its rest," Ps.
   cxvi. 7.

   (4.) Which is worst of all, it amends not the life, it heals not the
   evil, it cures not the distemper. When God speaks peace, it guides and
   keeps the soul that it "turn not again to folly." [27] When we speak it
   ourselves, the heart is not taken off the evil; nay, it is the readiest
   course in the world to bring a soul into a trade of backsliding. If,
   upon thy plastering thyself, thou findest thyself rather animated to
   the battle again than utterly weaned from it, it is too palpable that
   thou hast been at work with thine own soul, but Jesus Christ and his
   Spirit were not there. Yea, and oftentimes nature having done its work,
   will, ere a few days are over, come for its reward; and, having been
   active in the work of healing, will be ready to reason for a new
   wounding. In God's speaking peace there comes along so much sweetness,
   and such a discovery of his love, as is a strong obligation on the soul
   no more to deal perversely. [28]

   3. We speak peace to ourselves when we do it slightly. This the prophet
   complains of in some teachers: Jer. vi. 14, "They have healed the wound
   of the daughter of my people slightly." And it is so with some persons:
   they make the healing of their wounds a slight work; a look, a glance
   of faith to the promises does it, and so the matter is ended. The
   apostle tells us that "the word did not profit" some, because "it was
   not mixed with faith," Heb. iv. 2, -- me sunkekramenos; "it was not
   well tempered" and mingled with faith. It is not a mere look to the
   word of mercy in the promise, but it must be mingled with faith until
   it is incorporated into the very nature of it; and then, indeed, it
   doth good unto the soul. If thou hast had a wound upon thy conscience,
   which was attended with weakness and disquietness, which now thou art
   freed of, how camest thou so? "I looked to the promises of pardon and
   healing, and so found peace." Yea, but perhaps thou hast made too much
   haste, thou hast done it overtly, thou hast not fed upon the promise so
   as to mix it with faith, to have got all the virtue of it diffused into
   thy soul; only thou hast done it slightly. Thou wilt find thy wound,
   ere it be long, breaking out again; and thou shalt know that thou art
   not cured.

   4. Whoever speaks peace to himself upon any one account, and at the
   same time hath another evil of no less importance lying upon his
   spirit, about which he hath had no dealing with God, that man cries
   "Peace" when there is none. A little to explain my meaning: A man hath
   neglected a duty again and again, perhaps, when in all righteousness it
   was due from him; his conscience is perplexed, his soul wounded, he
   hath no quiet in his bones by reason of his sin; he applies himself for
   healing, and finds peace. Yet, in the meantime, perhaps, worldliness,
   or pride, or some other folly, wherewith the Spirit of God is
   exceedingly grieved, may lie in the bosom of that man, and they neither
   disturb him nor he them. Let not that man think that any of his peace
   is from God. Then shall it be well with men, when they have an equal
   respect to all God's commandments. God will justify us from our sins,
   but he will not justify the least sin in us: "He is a God of purer eyes
   than to behold iniquity."

   5. When men of themselves speak peace to their consciences, it is
   seldom that God speaks humiliation to their souls. God's peace is
   humbling peace, melting peace, as it was in the case of David; [29]
   never such deep humiliation as when Nathan brought him the tidings of
   his pardon.

   But you will say, "When may we take the comfort of a promise as our
   own, in relation to some peculiar wound, for the quieting the heart?"

   First, In general, when God speaks it, be it when it will, sooner or
   later. I told you before, he may do it in the very instant of the sin
   itself, and that with such irresistible power that the soul must needs
   receive his mind in it; sometimes he will make us wait longer: but when
   he speaks, be it sooner or later, be it when we are sinning or
   repenting, be the condition of our souls what they please, if God
   speak, he must be received. There is not any thing that, in our
   communion with him, the Lord is more troubled with us for, if I may so
   say, than our unbelieving fears, that keep us off from receiving that
   strong consolation which he is so willing to give to us.

   But you will say, "We are where we were. When God speaks it, we must
   receive it, that is true; but how shall we know when he speaks?"

   (1.) I would we could all practically come up to this, to receive peace
   when we are convinced that God speaks it, and that it is our duty to
   receive it. But, --

   (2.) There is, if I may so say, a secret instinct in faith, whereby it
   knows the voice of Christ when he speaks indeed; as the babe leaped in
   the womb when the blessed Virgin came to Elisabeth, faith leaps in the
   heart when Christ indeed draws nigh to it. "My sheep," says Christ,
   "know my voice," John x. 4; -- "They know my voice; they are used to
   the sound of it;" and they know when his lips are opened to them and
   are full of grace. The spouse was in a sad condition, Cant. v. 2, --
   asleep in security; but yet as soon as Christ speaks, she cries, "It is
   the voice of my beloved that speaks!" She knew his voice, and was so
   acquainted with communion with him, that instantly she discovers him;
   and so will you also. If you exercise yourselves to acquaintance and
   communion with him, you will easily discern between his voice and the
   voice of a stranger. And take this kriterion with you: When he doth
   speak, he speaks as never man spake; he speaks with power, and one way
   or other will make your "hearts burn within you," as he did to the
   disciples, Luke xxiv. He doth it by "putting in his hand at the hole of
   the door," Cant. v. 4, -- his Spirit into your hearts to seize on you.

   He that hath his senses exercised to discern good or evil, being
   increased in judgment and experience by a constant observation of the
   ways of Christ's intercourse, the manner of the operations of the
   Spirit, and the effects it usually produceth, is the best judge for
   himself in this case.

   Secondly, If the word of the Lord doth good to your souls, he speaks
   it; if it humble, if it cleanse, and be useful to those ends for which
   promises are given, -- namely, to endear, to cleanse, to melt and bind
   to obedience, to self-emptiness, etc. But this is not my business; nor
   shall I farther divert in the pursuit of this direction. Without the
   observation of it, sin will have great advantages towards the hardening
   of the heart.

                                  Chapter XIV.

   The general use of the foregoing directions -- The great direction for
   the accomplishment of the work aimed at: Act faith on Christ -- The
   several ways whereby this may be done -- Consideration of the fulness
   in Christ for relief proposed -- Great expectations from Christ --
   Grounds of these expectations: his mercifulness, his faithfulness --
   Event of such expectations; on the part of Christ; on the part of
   believers -- Faith peculiarly to be acted on the death of Christ, Rom.
   vi. 3-6 -- The work of the Spirit in this whole business.

   Now, the considerations which I have hitherto insisted on are rather of
   things preparatory to the work aimed at than such as will effect it. It
   is the heart's due preparation for the work itself, without which it
   will not be accomplished, that hitherto I have aimed at.

   Directions for the work itself are very few; I mean that are peculiar
   to it. And they are these that follow:--

   1. Set faith at work on Christ for the killing of thy sin. His blood is
   the great sovereign remedy for sin-sick souls. Live in this, and thou
   wilt die a conqueror; yea, thou wilt, through the good providence of
   God, live to see thy lust dead at thy feet.

   But thou wilt say, "How shall faith act itself on Christ for this end
   and purpose?" I say, Sundry ways:--

   (1.) By faith fill thy soul with a due consideration of that provision
   which is laid up in Jesus Christ for this end and purpose, that all thy
   lusts, this very lust wherewith thou art entangled, may be mortified.
   By faith ponder on this, that though thou art no way able in or by
   thyself to get the conquest over thy distemper, though thou art even
   weary of contending, and art utterly ready to faint, yet that there is
   enough in Jesus Christ to yield thee relief, Phil. iv. 13. It staid the
   prodigal, when he was [30] ready to faint, that yet there was bread
   enough in his father's house; though he was at a distance from it, yet
   it relieved him, and staid him, that there it was. In thy greatest
   distress and anguish, consider that fulness of grace, those riches,
   those [31] treasures of strength, might, and help, that are laid up in
   him for our support, John i. 16, Col. i. 19. Let them come into and
   abide in thy mind. Consider that he is "exalted and made a Prince and a
   Saviour to give repentance unto Israel," Acts v. 31; and if to give
   repentance, to give mortification, without which the other is not, nor
   can be. Christ tells us that we obtain purging grace by abiding in him,
   John xv. 3. To act faith upon the fulness that is in Christ for our
   supply is an eminent way of abiding in Christ, for both our insition
   and abode is by faith, Rom. xi. 19, 20. Let, then, thy soul by faith be
   exercised with such thoughts and apprehensions as these: "I am a poor,
   weak creature; unstable as water, I cannot excel. This corruption is
   too hard for me, and is at the very door of ruining my soul; and what
   to do I know not. My soul is become as parched ground, and an
   habitation of dragons. I have made promises and broken them; vows and
   engagements have been as a thing of nought. Many persuasions have I had
   that I had got the victory and should be delivered, but I am deceived;
   so that I plainly see, that without some eminent succour and
   assistance, I am lost, and shall be prevailed on to an utter
   relinquishment of God. But yet, though this be my state and condition,
   let the hands that hang down be lifted up, and the feeble knees be
   strengthened. Behold, [32] the Lord Christ, that hath all fulness of
   grace in his heart, all fulness of power in his hand, he is able to
   slay all these his enemies. There is sufficient provision in him for my
   relief and assistance. He can take my drooping, dying soul and make me
   more than a conqueror. [33] Why sayest thou, O my soul, My way is hid
   from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God? Hast thou
   not known, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the
   Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there
   is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and
   to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths
   shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but
   they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall
   mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they
   shall walk, and not faint,' Isa. xl. 27-31. He can make the dry,
   parched ground of my soul to become a pool, and my thirsty, barren
   heart as springs of water;' yea, he can make this habitation of
   dragons,' this heart, so full of abominable lusts and fiery
   temptations, to be a place for grass' and fruit to himself," Isa. xxxv.
   7. So God staid Paul, under his temptation, with the consideration of
   the sufficiency of his grace: "My grace is sufficient for thee," 2 Cor.
   xii. 9. Though he were not immediately so far made partaker of it as to
   be freed from his temptation, yet the sufficiency of it in God, for
   that end and purpose, was enough to stay his spirit. I say, then, by
   faith, be much in the consideration of that supply and the fulness of
   it that is in Jesus Christ, and how he can at any time give thee
   strength and deliverance. Now, if hereby thou dost not find success to
   a conquest, yet thou wilt be staid in the chariot, that thou shalt not
   fly out of the field until the battle be ended; thou wilt be kept from
   an utter despondency and a lying down under thy unbelief, or a turning
   aside to false means and remedies, that in the issue will not relieve
   thee. The efficacy of this consideration will be found only in the
   practice.

   (2.) Raise up thy heart by faith to an expectation of relief from
   Christ. Relief in this case from Christ is like the prophet's vision,
   Hab. ii. 3, "It is for an appointed time, but at the end it shall
   speak, and not lie: though it tarry, yet wait for it; because it will
   surely come, it will not tarry." Though it may seem somewhat long to
   thee, whilst thou art under thy trouble and perplexity, yet it shall
   surely come in the appointed time of the Lord Jesus; which is the best
   season. If, then, thou canst raise up thy heart to a settled
   expectation of relief from Jesus Christ, -- if thine eyes are towards
   him "as the eyes of a servant to the hand of his master," [34] when he
   expects to receive somewhat from him, -- thy soul shall be satisfied,
   he will assuredly deliver thee; he will slay the lust, and thy latter
   end shall be peace. Only look for it at his hand; expect when and how
   he will do it. [35] "If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
   established."

   But wilt thou say, "What ground have I to build such an expectation
   upon, so that I may expect not to be deceived?"

   As thou hast necessity to put thee on this course, thou must be
   relieved and saved this way or none. To [36] whom wilt thou go? So
   there are in the Lord Jesus innumerable things to encourage and engage
   thee to this expectation.

   For the necessity of it, I have in part discovered it before, when I
   manifested that this is the work of faith and of believers only.
   "Without me," says Christ, "ye can do nothing," John xv. 5; speaking
   with especial relation to the purging of the heart from sin, verse 2.
   Mortification of any sin must be by a supply of grace. Of ourselves we
   cannot do it. Now, "it hath pleased the Father that in Christ should
   all fulness dwell," Col. i. 19; that "of his fulness we might receive
   grace for grace," John i. 16. He is the head from whence the new man
   must have influences of life and strength, or it will decay every day.
   If [37] we are "strengthened with might in the inner man," it is by
   "Christ's dwelling in our hearts by faith," Eph. iii. 16, 17. That this
   work is not to be done without the Spirit I have also showed before.
   Whence, then, do we expect the Spirit? from whom do we look for him?
   who hath promised him to us, having procured him for us? Ought not all
   our expectations to this purpose to be on Christ alone? Let this, then,
   be fixed upon thy heart, that if thou hast not relief from him thou
   shalt never have any. All ways, endeavours, contendings, that are not
   animated by this expectation of relief from Christ and him only are to
   no purpose, will do thee no good; yea, if they are any thing but
   supportments of thy heart in this expectation, or means appointed by
   himself for the receiving help from him, they are in vain.

   Now, farther to engage thee to this expectation, --

   (1.) Consider his mercifulness, tenderness, and kindness, as he is our
   great High Priest at the right hand of God. Assuredly he pities thee in
   thy distress; saith he, "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I
   comfort you," Isa. lxvi. 13. He hath the tenderness of a mother to a
   sucking child. Heb. ii. 17, 18, "Wherefore in all things it behoved him
   to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and
   faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make
   reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath
   suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted."
   How is the ability of Christ upon the account of his suffering proposed
   to us? "In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able."
   Did the sufferings and temptations of Christ add to his ability and
   power? Not, doubtless, considered absolutely and in it itself. But the
   ability here mentioned is such as hath readiness, proneness,
   willingness to put itself forth, accompanying of it; it is an ability
   of will against all dissuasions. He is able, having suffered and been
   tempted, to break through all dissuasions to the contrary, to relieve
   poor tempted souls: Dunatai boethesai, -- "He is able to help." It is a
   metonymy of the effect; for, he can now be moved to help, having been
   so tempted. So chap. iv. 15, 16: "For we have not an high priest which
   cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all
   points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come
   boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
   grace to help in time of need." The exhortation of verse 16 is the same
   that I am upon, -- namely, that we would entertain expectations of
   relief from Christ, which the apostle there calls charin eis eukairon
   boetheian, "grace for seasonable help." "If ever," says the soul, "help
   were seasonable, it would be so to me in my present condition. This is
   that which I long for, -- grace for seasonable help. I am ready to die,
   to perish, to be lost for ever; iniquity will prevail against me, if
   help come not in." Says the apostle, "Expect this help, this relief,
   this grace from Christ." Yea, but on what account? That which he lays
   down, verse 15. And we may observe that the word, verse 16, which we
   have translated to "obtain," is labomen. Hina labomen eleon, "That we
   may receive it;" suitable and seasonable help will come in. I shall
   freely say, this one thing of establishing the soul by faith in
   expectation of relief from Jesus Christ, [38] on the account of his
   mercifulness as our high priest, will be more available to the ruin of
   thy lust and distemper, and have a better and speedier issue, than all
   the rigidest means of self-maceration that ever any of the sons of men
   engaged themselves unto. Yea, let me add, that never any soul did or
   shall perish by the power of any lust, sin, or corruption, who could
   raise his soul by faith to an expectation of relief from Jesus Christ.
   [39]

   (2.) Consider His faithfulness who hath promised; which may raise thee
   up and confirm thee in this waiting in an expectation of relief. He
   hath promised to relieve in such cases, and he will fulfil his word to
   the utmost. God tells us that his covenant with us is like the
   "ordinances" of heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, which have their
   certain courses, Jer. xxxi. 36. Thence David said that he watched for
   relief from God "as one watched for the morning," [40] -- a thing that
   will certainly come in its appointed season. So will be thy relief from
   Christ. It will come in its season, as the dew and rain upon the
   parched ground; for faithful is he who hath promised. Particular
   promises to this purpose are innumerable; with some of them, that seem
   peculiarly to suit his condition, let the soul be always furnished.

   Now, there are two eminent advantages which always attend this
   expectation of succour from Jesus Christ:--

   [1.] It engages him to a full and speedy assistance. Nothing doth more
   engage the heart of a man to be useful and helpful to another than his
   expectation of help from him, if justly raised and countenanced by him
   who is to give the relief. Our Lord Jesus hath raised our hearts, by
   his kindness, care, and promises, to this expectation; certainly our
   rising up unto it must needs be a great engagement upon him to assist
   us accordingly. This the Psalmist gives us as an approved maxim, "Thou,
   Lord, never forsakest them that put their trust in thee." When the
   heart is once won to rest in God, to repose himself on him, he will
   assuredly satisfy it. He will never be as water that fails; nor hath he
   said at any time to the seed of Jacob, "Seek ye my face in vain." If
   Christ be chosen for the foundation of our supply, he will not fail us.

   [2.] It engages the heart to attend diligently to all the ways and
   means whereby Christ is wont to communicate himself to the soul; and so
   takes in the real assistance of all graces and ordinances whatever. He
   that expects any thing from a man, applies himself to the ways and
   means whereby it may be obtained. The beggar that expects an alms lies
   at his door or in his way from whom he doth expect it. The way whereby
   and the means wherein Christ communicates himself is, and are, his
   ordinances ordinarily; he that expects any thing from him must attend
   upon him therein. It is the expectation of faith that sets the heart on
   work. It is not an idle, groundless hope that I speak of. If now there
   be any vigour, efficacy, and power in prayer or sacrament to this end
   of mortifying sin, a man will assuredly be interested in it all by this
   expectation of relief from Christ. On this account I reduce all
   particular actings, by prayer, meditation, and the like, to this head;
   and so shall not farther insist on them, when they are grounded on this
   bottom and spring from this root. They are of singular use to this
   purpose, and not else.

   Now, on this direction for the mortification of a prevailing distemper
   you may have a thousand "probatum est's." Who have walked with God
   under this temptation, and have not found the use and success of it? I
   dare leave the soul under it, without adding any more. Only some
   particulars relating thereunto may be mentioned:--

   First, Act faith peculiarly upon the death, blood, and cross of Christ;
   that is, on Christ as crucified and slain. Mortification of sin is
   peculiarly from the death of Christ. It is one peculiar, yea, eminent
   end of the death of Christ, which shall assuredly be accomplished by
   it. He died to destroy the works of the devil. Whatever came upon our
   natures by his first temptation, whatever receives strength in our
   persons by his daily suggestions, Christ died to destroy it all. "He
   gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
   purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works," Tit. ii.
   14. This was his aim and intendment (wherein he will not fail) in his
   giving himself for us. That we might be freed from the power of our
   sins, and purified from all our defiling lusts, was his design. "He
   gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it;
   that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot,
   or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and without
   blemish," Eph. v. 25-27. And this, by virtue of his death, in various
   and several degrees, shall be accomplished. Hence our washing, purging,
   and cleansing is everywhere ascribed to his blood, 1 John i. 7; Heb. i.
   3; Rev. i. 5. That being sprinkled on us, "purges our consciences from
   dead works to serve the living God," Heb. ix. 14. This is that we aim
   at, this we are in pursuit of, -- that our consciences may be purged
   from dead works, that they may be rooted out, destroyed, and have place
   in us no more. This shall certainly be brought about by the death of
   Christ; there will virtue go out from thence to this purpose. Indeed,
   all supplies of the Spirit, all communications of grace and power, are
   from hence; as I have elsewhere [41] showed. Thus the apostle states
   it; Rom. vi. 2, is the case proposed that we have in hand: "How shall
   we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" -- "Dead to sin by
   profession; dead to sin by obligation to be so; dead to sin by
   participation of virtue and power for the killing of it; dead to sin by
   union and interest in Christ, in and by whom it is killed: how shall we
   live therein?" This he presses by sundry considerations, all taken from
   the death of Christ, in the ensuing verses. This must not be: verse 3,
   "Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
   were baptized into his death?" We have in baptism an evidence of our
   implantation into Christ; we are baptized into him: but what of him are
   we baptized into an interest in? "His death," saith he. If indeed we
   are baptized into Christ, and beyond outward profession, we are
   baptized into his death. The explication of this, of one being baptized
   into the death of Christ, the apostle gives us, verses 4, 6: "Therefore
   we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was
   raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
   should walk in newness of life. Knowing this, that our old man is
   crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
   henceforth we should not serve sin." "This is," saith he, "our being
   baptized into the death of Christ, namely, our conformity thereunto; to
   be dead unto sin, to have our corruptions mortified, as he was put to
   death for sin: so that as he was raised up to glory, we may be raised
   up to grace and newness of life." He tells us whence it is that we have
   this baptism into the death of Christ, verse 6; and this is from the
   death of Christ itself: "Our old man is crucified with him, that the
   body of sin might be destroyed;" sunestaurothe, "is crucified with
   him," not in respect of time, but causality. We are crucified with him
   meritoriously, in that he procured the Spirit for us to mortify sin;
   efficiently, in that from his death virtue comes forth for our
   crucifying; in the way of a representation and exemplar we shall
   assuredly be crucified unto sin, as he was for our sin. This is that
   the apostle intends: Christ by his death destroying the works of the
   devil, procuring the Spirit for us, hath so killed sin, as to its reign
   in believers, that it shall not obtain its end and dominion.

   Secondly, Then act faith on the death of Christ, and that under these
   two notions, -- first, In expectation of power; secondly, In endeavours
   for conformity. [42] For the first, the direction given in general may
   suffice; as to the latter, that of the apostle may give us some light
   into our direction, Gal. iii. 1. Let faith look on Christ in the gospel
   as he is set forth dying and crucified for us. Look on him under the
   weight [43] of our sins, praying, bleeding, dying; bring him in that
   condition into thy heart by faith; apply his blood so shed to thy
   corruptions: do this daily. I might draw out this consideration to a
   great length, in sundry particulars, but I must come to a close.

   2. I have only, then, to add the heads of the work of the Spirit in
   this business of mortification, which is so peculiarly ascribed to him.

   In one word: This whole work, which I have described as our duty, is
   effected, carried on, and accomplished by the power of the Spirit, in
   all the parts and degrees of it; as, --

   (1.) He alone clearly and fully convinces the heart of the evil and
   guilt and danger of the corruption, lust, or sin to be mortified.
   Without this conviction, or whilst it is so faint that the heart can
   wrestle with it or digest it, there will be no thorough work made. An
   unbelieving heart (as in part we have all such) will shift with any
   consideration, until it be overpowered by clear and evident
   convictions. Now this is the proper work of the Spirit: "He convinces
   of sin," John xvi. 8; he alone can do it. If men's rational
   considerations, with the preaching of the letter, were able to convince
   them of sin, we should, it may be, see more convictions than we do.
   There comes by the preaching of the word an apprehension upon the
   understandings of men that they are sinners, that such and such things
   are sins, that themselves are guilty of them; but this light is not
   powerful, nor doth it lay hold on the practical principles of the soul,
   so as to conform the mind and will unto them, to produce effects
   suitable to such an apprehension. And therefore it is that wise and
   knowing men, destitute of the Spirit, do not think those things to be
   sins at all wherein the chief movings and actings of lust do consist.
   It is the Spirit alone that can do, that doth, this work to the
   purpose. And this is the first thing that the Spirit doth in order to
   the mortification of any lust whatever, -- it convinces the soul of all
   the evil of it, cuts off all its pleas, discovers all its deceits,
   stops all its evasions, answers its pretences, makes the soul own its
   abomination, and lie down under the sense of it. Unless this be done
   all that follows is in vain.

   (2.) The Spirit alone reveals unto us the fulness of Christ for our
   relief; which is the consideration that stays the heart from false ways
   and from despairing despondency, 1 Cor. ii 8.

   (3.) The Spirit alone establishes the heart in expectation of relief
   from Christ; which is the great sovereign means of mortification, as
   hath been discovered, 2 Cor. i. 21.

   (4.) The Spirit alone brings the cross of Christ into our hearts with
   its sin-killing power; for by the Spirit are we baptized into the death
   of Christ.

   (5.) The Spirit is the author and finisher of our sanctification; gives
   new supplies and influences of grace for holiness and sanctification,
   when the contrary principle is weakened and abated, Eph. iii. 16-18.

   (6.) In all the soul's addresses to God in this condition, it hath
   supportment from the Spirit. Whence is the power, life, and vigour of
   prayer? whence its efficacy to prevail with God? Is it not from the
   Spirit? He is the "Spirit of supplications" promised to them "who look
   on him whom they have pierced," Zech. xii. 10, enabling them "to pray
   with sighs and groans that cannot be uttered," Rom. viii. 26. This is
   confessed to be the great medium or way of faith's prevailing with God.
   Thus Paul dealt with his temptation, whatever it were: "I besought the
   Lord that it might depart from me." [44] What is the work of the Spirit
   in prayer, whence and how it gives us in assistance and makes us to
   prevail, what we are to do that we may enjoy his help for that purpose,
   is not my present intendment to demonstrate.
