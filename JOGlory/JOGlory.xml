<p>
   The following treatise may be regarded as a series of Discourses on
   <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference> The subject is the Glory of Christ, as the
   representative of God to the church, -- in the mystery of his Person,
   -- in his office as Mediator, -- in his exaltation on high, -- in his
   relation to the church during every age of its history, -- and in the
   final consummation of his work, when all things are to be gathered into
   a blessed unity, as the result of his mediation. The treatise is
   concluded by a statement of the difference between our views of the
   Glory of Christ as beheld by faith in this world, and as it shall be
   beheld by sight in heaven.
				</p><p>
   It is not professedly a sequel to the work of the author on the Person
   of Christ; though, from some expressions in the Preface to these
   Meditations, they may be regarded in this light. Several of them are
   evidently an expansion of certain thoughts and views, of which the germ
   will be found in the preceding work. The two works are, indeed, so
   closely connected, that they have been often published together. It has
   been thought proper, therefore, to adhere to this arrangement in the
   present republication of Dr Owen's Works.
				</p><p>
   There are some facts which impart peculiar interest to these
   Meditations. They were drawn up, according to the author's own
   statement, "for the exercise of his own mind," in the first instance;
   and illustrate, accordingly, the scope and tenor of his Christian
   experience. They form, moreover, his dying testimony to the truth, --
   and to the truth, with peculiar emphasis, as it "is in Jesus;" for they
   are the substance of the last instructions which he delivered to his
   flock; and they constitute the last work which he prepared for the
   press. It is instructive to peruse the solemn musings of his soul when
   "weakness, weariness, and the near approaches of death," were calling
   him away from his earthly labours; and to mark how intently his
   thoughts were fixed on the glory of the Saviour, whom he was soon to
   behold "face to face." On the day of his death, Mr Payne, who had the
   charge of the original publication of this treatise, on bidding Dr Owen
   farewell, said to him, "Doctor, I have just been putting your book on
   the Glory of Christ to the press." "I am glad," was Owen's reply, "to
   hear that that performance is put to the press; but, O brother Payne,
   the long looked-for day is come at last, in which I shall see that
   glory in another manner than I have ever done yet, or was capable of
   doing in this world."
				</p><p>
   Mr Hervey thus expresses his admiration of this work: "To see the Glory
   of Christ is the grand blessing which our Lord solicits and demands for
   his disciples in his last solemn intercession, <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference> Should
   the reader desire assistance in this important work, I would refer him
   to a little treatise of Dr Owen's, entitled Meditations on the Glory of
   Christ;' it is little in size, -- not so in value. Were I to speak of
   it in the classical style, I should call it aureus, gemmeus, mellitus.
   But I would rather say, it is richly replenished with that unction from
   the Holy One which tends to enlighten the eyes and cheer the heart;
   which sweetens the enjoyments of life, softens the hours of death, and
   prepares for the fruitions of eternity." -- Theron and Aspasiovol. iii.
   p. 75.
				</p><p>
   The treatise was published in 1684. It was reprinted in 1696, with the
   addition of two chapters which were found among the papers of Owen, and
   in his own handwriting, though too late for insertion in the first
   edition of the work. -- Ed.

<title>Preface to the reader.</title>
<p>
   Christian Reader,
				</p><p>
   The design of the ensuing Discourse is to declare some part of that
   glory of our Lord Jesus Christ which is revealed in the Scripture, and
   proposed as the principal object of our faith, love, delight, and
   admiration. But, alas! after our utmost and most diligent inquiries, we
   must say, How little a portion is it of him that we can understand! His
   glory is incomprehensible, and his praises are unutterable. Some things
   an illuminated mind may conceive of it; but what we can express in
   comparison of what it is in itself, is even less than nothing. But as
   for those who have forsaken the only true guide herein, endeavouring to
   be wise above what is written, and to raise their contemplations by
   fancy and imagination above Scripture revelation (as many have done),
   they have darkened counsel without knowledge, uttering things which
   they understand not, which have no substance or spiritual food of faith
   in them.
				</p><p>
   Howbeit, that real view which we may have of Christ and his glory in
   this world by faith, however weak and obscure that knowledge which we
   may attain of them by divine revelation, -- is inexpressibly to be
   preferred above all other wisdom, understanding, or knowledge whatever.
   So it is declared by him who will be acknowledged a competent judge in
   these things. "Yea, doubtless," saith he, "I count all these things but
   loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." He
   who does not so has no part in him.
				</p><p>
   The revelation made of Christ in the blessed Gospel is far more
   excellent, more glorious, and more filled with rays of divine wisdom
   and goodness, than the whole creation and the just comprehension of it,
   if attainable, can contain or afford. Without the knowledge hereof, the
   mind of man, however priding itself in other inventions and
   discoveries, is wrapped up in darkness and confusion.
				</p><p>
   This, therefore, deserves the severest of our thoughts, the best of our
   meditations, and our utmost diligence in them. For if our future
   blessedness shall consist in being where he is, and beholding of his
   glory, what better preparation can there be for it than in a constant
   previous contemplation of that glory in the revelation that is made in
   the Gospel, unto this very end, that by a view of it we may be
   gradually transformed into the same glory?
				</p><p>
   I shall not, therefore, use any apology for the publishing of the
   ensuing Meditations, intended first for the exercise of my own mind,
   and then for the edification of a private congregation; which is like
   to be the last service I shall do them in that kind. Some may, by the
   consideration of them, be called to attend unto the same duty with more
   diligence than formerly, and receive directions for the discharge of
   it; and some may be provoked to communicate their greater light and
   knowledge unto the good of many. And that which I design farther in the
   present Discourse, is to give a brief account of the necessity and use,
   in life and death, of the duty exhorted unto.
				</p><p>
   Particular motives unto the diligent discharge of this duty will be
   pressed in the Discourse itself. Here some things more general only
   shall be premised. For all persons not immersed in sensual pleasures,
   -- not overdrenched in the love of this world and present things, --
   who have any generous or noble thought about their own nature, being,
   and end, -- are under the highest obligation to betake themselves unto
   this contemplation of Christ and his glory. Without this, they shall
   never attain true rest or satisfaction in their own minds. He it is
   alone in whom the race of mankind may boast and glory, on whom all its
   felicities do depend. For, --
				</p><p>
   I. He it is in whom our nature, which was debased as low as hell by
   apostasy from God, is exalted above the whole creation. Our nature, in
   the original constitution of it, in the persons of our first parents,
   was crowned with honour and dignity. The image of God, wherein it was
   made, and the dominion over the lower world wherewith it was intrusted,
   made it the seat of excellence, of beauty, and of glory. But of them
   all it was at once divested and made naked by sin, and laid grovelling
   in the dust from whence it was taken. "Dust thou are, and to dust thou
   shalt return," was its righteous doom. And all its internal faculties
   were invaded by deformed lusts, -- everything that might render the
   whole unlike unto God, whose image it had lost. Hence it became the
   contempt of angels, the dominion of Satan; who, being the enemy of the
   whole creation, never had any thing or place to reign in but the
   debased nature of man. Nothing was now more vile and base; its glory
   was utterly departed. It had both lost its peculiar nearness unto God,
   which was its honour, and was fallen into the greatest distance from
   him of all creatures, the devils only excepted; which was its ignominy
   and shame. And in this state, as unto anything in itself, it was left
   to perish eternally.
				</p><p>
   In this condition -- lost, poor, base, yea, cursed -- the Lord Christ,
   the Son of God, found our nature. And hereon, in infinite condescension
   and compassion, sanctifying a portion of it unto himself, he took it to
   be his own, in a holy, ineffable subsistence, in his own person. And
   herein again the same nature, so depressed into the utmost misery, is
   exalted above the whole creation of God. For in that very nature, God
   has "set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above
   all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name
   that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to
   come." This is that which is so celebrated by the Psalmist, with the
   highest admiration, <reference osisRef="Ps.8.3 Ps.8.4 Ps.8.5 Ps.8.6 Ps.8.7 Ps.8.8">Psalms 8:3-8</reference> This is the greatest privilege we
   have among all our fellow-creatures, -- this we may glory in, and value
   ourselves upon. Those who engage this nature in the service of sensual
   lusts and pleasures, -- who think that its felicity and utmost
   capacities consist in their satisfaction, with the accomplishment of
   other earthly, temporal desires, -- are satisfied with it in its state
   of apostasy from God; but those who have received the light of faith
   and grace, so as rightly to understand the being and end of that nature
   whereof they are partakers, cannot but rejoice in its deliverance from
   the utmost debasement, into that glorious exaltation which it has
   received in the person of Christ. And this must needs make thoughts of
   him full of refreshment unto their souls. Let us take care of our
   persons, -- the glory of our nature is safe in him. For, --
				</p><p>
   II. In him the relation of our nature unto God is eternally secured. We
   were created in a covenant relation unto God. Our nature was related
   unto him in a way of friendship, of likeness, and complacency. But the
   bond of this relation and union was quickly broken, by our apostasy
   from him. Hereon our whole nature became to be at the utmost moral
   distance from God, and enmity against him; which is the depth of
   misery. But God, in infinite wisdom and grace, did design once more to
   recover it, and take it again near unto himself. And he would do it in
   such a way as should render it utterly impossible that there would ever
   be a separation between him and it any more. Heaven and earth may pass
   away, but there shall never be a dissolution of the union between God
   and our nature any more. He did it, therefore, by assuming it into a
   substantial union with himself, in the person of the Son. Hereby the
   fulness of the Godhead dwelt in it bodily, or substantially, and
   eternally. Hereby is its relation unto God eternally secured. And among
   all the mysterious excellencies which relate hereunto, there are two
   which continually present themselves unto our consideration.
				</p><p>
   1. That this nature of ours is capable of this glorious exaltation and
   subsistence in God. No creature could conceive how omnipotent wisdom,
   power, and goodness, could actuate themselves unto the production of
   this effect. The mystery hereof is the object of the admiration of
   angels, and will be so of the whole church, unto all eternity. What is
   revealed concerning the glory, way, and manner of it, in the Scripture,
   I have declared in my treatise concerning the Mystery of Godliness, or
   the Person of Christ. What mind can conceive, what tongue can express,
   who can sufficiently admire, the wisdom, goodness, and condescension of
   God herein? And whereas he has proposed unto us this glorious object of
   our faith and meditation, how vile and foolish are we, if we spend our
   thoughts about other things in a neglect of it!
				</p><p>
   2. This is also an ineffable pledge of the love of God unto our nature.
   For although he will not take it in any other instance, save that of
   the man Christ Jesus, into this relation with himself, by virtue of
   personal union, yet therein he has given a glorious pledge of his love
   unto, and valuation of, that nature. For "verily he took not on him the
   nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham." And this
   kindness extends unto our persons, as participant of that nature. For
   he designed this glory unto the man Christ Jesus, that might be the
   firstborn of the new creation, that we might be made conformable unto
   him according to our measure; and as the members of that body, whereof
   he is the head, we are participant in this glory.
				</p><p>
   III. It is he in whom our nature has been carried successfully and
   victoriously through all the oppositions that it is liable unto, and
   even death itself. But the glory hereof I shall speak unto distinctly
   in its proper place, which follows, and therefore shall here pass it
   by.
				</p><p>
   IV. He it is who in himself has given us a pledge of the capacity of
   our nature to inhabit those blessed regions of light, which are far
   above these aspectable heavens. Here we dwell in tabernacles of clay,
   that are "crushed before the moth," -- such as cannot be raised, so as
   to abide one foot-breadth above the earth we tread upon. The heavenly
   luminaries which we can behold appear too great and glorious for our
   cohabitation. We are as grasshoppers in our own eyes, in comparison of
   those gigantic beings; and they seem to dwell in places which would
   immediately swallow up and extinguish our natures. How, then, shall we
   entertain an apprehension of being carried and exalted above them all?
   to have an everlasting subsistence in places incomprehensibly more
   glorious than the orbs wherein they reside? What capacity is there in
   our nature of such a habitation? But hereof the Lord Christ has given
   us a pledge in himself. Our nature in him is passed through these
   aspectable heavens, and is exalted far above them. Its eternal
   habitation is in the blessed regions of light and glory; and he has
   promised that where he is, there we shall be, and that for ever.
				</p><p>
   Other encouragements there are innumerable to stir us up unto diligence
   in the discharge of the duty here proposed, -- namely, a continual
   contemplation of the glory of Christ, in his person, office, and grace.
   Some of them, the principal of them which I have any acquaintance with,
   are represented in the ensuing Discourse. I shall therefore here add
   the peculiar advantage which we may obtain in the diligent discharge of
   this duty; which is, -- that it will carry us cheerfully, comfortably,
   and victoriously through life and death, and all that we have to
   conflict withal in either of them.
				</p><p>
   And let it be remembered, that I do here suppose what is written on
   this subject in the ensuing Discourse as being designed to prepare the
   minds of the readers for the due improvement of it.
				</p><p>
   As unto this present life, it is well known what it is unto the most of
   them who concern themselves in these things. Temptations, afflictions,
   changes, sorrows, dangers, fears, sickness, and pains, do fill up no
   small part of it. And on the other hand, all our earthly relishes,
   refreshments, and comfort, are uncertain, transitory, and
   unsatisfactory; all things of each sort being embittered by the
   remainders of sin. Hence everything wherein we are concerned has the
   root of trouble and sorrow in it. Some labour under wants, poverty, and
   straits all their days; and some have very few hours free from pains
   and sickness. And all these things, with others of an alike nature, are
   heightened at present by the calamitous season wherein our lot is
   fallen. All things almost in all nations are filled with confusions,
   disorders, dangers, distresses, and troubles; wars and rumours of wars
   do abound, with tokens of farther approaching judgments; distress of
   nations, with perplexity, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for
   looking after those things which are coming on the earth. There is in
   many places "no peace unto him that goeth out, nor to him that cometh
   in, but great vexations are on the inhabitants of the world: nation is
   destroyed of nation, and city of city; for God doth vex them with all
   adversity." [<reference osisRef="2Chr.15.5 2Chr.15.6">2 Chronicles 15:5-6</reference>] And in the meantime, vexation with the
   ungodly deeds of wicked men does greatly further the troubles of life;
   the sufferings of many also for the testimony of their consciences are
   deplorable, with the divisions and animosities that abound amongst all
   sorts of Christians.
				</p><p>
   But the shortness, the vanity, the miseries of human life, have been
   the subject of the complains of all sort of considering persons,
   heathens as well as Christians; nor is it my present business to insist
   upon them. My inquiry is only after the relief which we may obtain
   against all these evils, that we faint not under them, that we may have
   the victory over them.
				</p><p>
   This in general is declared by the apostle 2 Cor. iv., "We are troubled
   on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in
   despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed."
   But for this cause "we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
   yet the inward man is renewed day be day. For our light affliction,
   which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
   eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are
   seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are
   seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
				</p><p>
   Our beholding by faith things that are not seen, things spiritual and
   eternal, will alienate all our afflictions, -- make their burden light,
   and preserve our souls from fainting under them. Of these things the
   glory of Christ, whereof we treat, is the principal, and in due sense
   comprehensive of them all. For we behold the glory of God himself "in
   the face of Jesus Christ." He that can at all times retreat unto the
   contemplation of this glory, will be carried above the perplexing
   prevailing sense of any of these evils, of a confluence of them all.
   "Crus nil sentit in nervo, dum animus est in coelo."
				</p><p>
   It is a woeful kind of life, when men scramble for poor perishing
   reliefs in their distresses. This is the universal remedy and cure, --
   the only balsam for all our diseases. Whatever presseth, urgeth,
   perplexeth, if we can but retreat in our minds unto a view of this
   glory, and a due consideration of our own interest therein, comfort and
   supportment will be administered unto us. Wicked men, in their distress
   (which sometimes overtake even them also), are like "a troubled sea,
   that cannot rest." Others are heartless, and despond, -- not without
   secret repinings at the wise disposals of Divine Providence, especially
   when they look on the better condition (as they suppose) of others. And
   the best of us all are apt to wax faint and weary when these things
   press upon us in an unusual manner, or under their long continuance,
   without a prospect of relief. This is the stronghold which such
   prisoners of hope are to turn themselves unto. In this contemplation of
   the glory of Christ they will find rest unto their own souls. For, --
				</p><p>
   1. It will herein, and in the discharge of this duty, be made evident
   how slight and inconsiderable all these things are from whence our
   troubles and distresses do arise. For they all grow on this root of an
   over-valuation of temporal things. And unless we can arrive unto a
   fixed judgment that all things here below are transitory and perishing,
   reaching only unto the outward man, or the body, (perhaps unto the
   killing of it), -- that the best of them have nothing that is truly
   substantial or abiding in them, -- that there are other things, wherein
   we have an assured interest, that are incomparably better than they,
   and above them, -- it is impossible but that we must spend our lives in
   fears, sorrows, and distractions. One real view of the glory of Christ,
   and of our own concernment therein, will give us a full relief in this
   matter. For what are all the things of this life? What is the good or
   evil of them in comparison of an interest in this transcendent glory?
   When we have due apprehensions hereof, -- when our minds are possessed
   with thoughts of it, -- when our affections reach out after its
   enjoyments, -- let pain, and sickness, and sorrows, and fears, and
   dangers, and death, say what they will, we shall have in readiness
   wherewith to combat with them and overcome them; and that on this
   consideration, that they are all outward, transitory, and passing away,
   whereas our minds are fixed on those things which are eternal, and
   filled with incomprehensible glory.
				</p><p>
   2. The minds of men are apt by their troubles to be cast into disorder,
   to be tossed up and down, and disquieted with various affections and
   passions. So the Psalmist found it in himself in the time of his
   distress; whence he calls himself unto that account, "Why art thou cast
   down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted in me?" And, indeed, the
   mind on all such occasions is its own greatest troubler. It is apt to
   let loose its passions of fear and sorrow, which act themselves in
   innumerable perplexing thoughts, until it is carried utterly out of its
   own power. But in this state a due contemplation of the glory of Christ
   will restore and compose the mind, -- bring it into a sedate, quiet
   frame, wherein faith will be able to say unto the winds and waves of
   distempered passions, "Peace, be still;" and they shall obey it.
				</p><p>
   3. It is the way and means of conveying a sense of God's love unto our
   souls; which is that alone where ultimately we find rest in the midst
   of all the troubles of this life; as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.2 Rom.5.3 Rom.5.4 Rom.5.5">Romans 5:2-5</reference>
   It is the Spirit of God who alone communicates a sense of this love
   unto our souls; it is "shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost."
   Howbeit, there are ways and means to be used on our part, whereby we
   may be disposed and made meet to receive these communications of divine
   love. Among these the principal is the contemplation of the glory of
   Christ insisted on, and of God the Father in him. It is the season, it
   is the way and means, at which and whereby the Holy Ghost will give a
   sense of the love of God unto us, causing us thereon to "rejoice with
   joy unspeakable and full of glory." This will be made evident in the
   ensuing Discourse. This will lift the minds and hearts of believers
   above all the troubles of this life, and is the sovereign antidote that
   will expel all the poison that is in them; which otherwise might
   perplex and enslave their souls.
				</p><p>
   I have but touched on these things, as designing to enlarge somewhat on
   that which does ensue. And this is the advantage we may have in the
   discharge of this duty with respect unto death itself: It is the
   assiduous contemplation of the glory of Christ which will carry us
   cheerfully and comfortably into it, and through it. My principal work
   having been now for a long season to die daily, as living in a
   continual expectation of my dissolution, I shall on this occasion
   acquaint the reader with some few of my thoughts and reliefs with
   reference unto death itself.
				</p><p>
   There are sundry things required of us, that we may be able to
   encounter death cheerfully, constantly, and victoriously. For want of
   these, or some of them, I have known gracious souls who have lived in a
   kind of bondage for fear of death all their days. We know not how God
   will manage any of our minds and souls in that season, in that trial;
   for he acts towards us in all such things in a way of sovereignty. But
   these are the things which he requireth of us in way of duty: 
				</p><p>
   First, Peculiar actings of faith to resign and commit our departing
   souls into the hand of him who is able to receive them, to keep and
   preserve them, as also to dispose of them into a state of rest and
   blessedness, are required of us.
				</p><p>
   The soul is now parting with all things here below, and that for ever.
   None of all the things which it has seen, heard, or enjoyed, be it
   outward senses, can be prevailed with to stay with it one hour, or to
   take one step with it in the voyage wherein it is engaged. It must
   alone by itself launch into eternity. It is entering an invisible
   world, which it knows no more of than it has received by faith. None
   has come from the dead to inform us of the state of the other world;
   yea, God seems on purpose so to conceal it from us, that we should have
   no evidence of it, at least as unto the manner of things in it, but
   what is given unto faith by divine revelation. Hence those who died and
   were raised again from the dead unto any continuance among men, as
   Lazarus, probably knew nothing of the invisible state. Their souls were
   preserved by the power of God in their being, but bound up as unto
   present operations. This made a great emperor cry out, on the approach
   of death, "O animula, tremula, vagula, blandula; qu� nunc abibis in
   loca horrida, squalida," etc.. -- "O poor, trembling, wandering soul,
   into what places of darkness and defilement art thou going?" [1]
				</p><p>
   How is it like to be after the few moments which, under the pangs of
   death, we have to continue in this world? Is it an annihilation that
   lies at the door? Is death the destruction of our whole being, so as
   that after it we shall be no more? So some would have the state of
   things to be. Is it a state of subsistence in a wandering condition, up
   and down the world, under the influence of other more powerful spirits
   that rule in the air, visiting tombs and solitary places, and sometimes
   making appearances of themselves by the impressions of those more
   powerful spirits; as some imagine from the story concerning Samuel and
   the witch of Endor, and as it is commonly received in the Papacy, out
   of a compliance with their imagination of purgatory? Or is it a state
   of universal misery and woe? a state incapable of comfort or joy? Let
   them pretend what they please, who can understand no comfort or joy in
   this life but what they receive by their senses; -- they can look for
   nothing else. And whatever be the state of this invisible world, the
   soul can undertake nothing of its own conduct after its departure from
   the body. It knows that it must be absolutely at the disposal of
   another.
				</p><p>
   Wherefore no man can comfortably venture on and into this condition,
   but in the exercise of that faith which enables him to resign and give
   up his departing soul into the hand of God, who alone is able to
   receive it, and to dispose it into a condition of rest and blessedness.
   So speaks the apostle, "I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have
   believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have
   committed unto him again that day."
				</p><p>
   Herein, as in all other graces, is our Lord Jesus Christ our great
   example. He resigned his departing spirit into the hands of his Father,
   to be owned and preserved by him, in its state of separation: "Father,
   into thy hands I commend my spirit," <reference osisRef="Luke.23.46">Luke 23:46</reference>; as did the
   Psalmist, his type, in an alike condition, <reference osisRef="Ps.31.5">Psalms 31:5</reference> But the faith
   of our Lord Jesus Christ herein, -- the object and exercise of it, what
   he believed and trusted unto in this resignation of his spirit into the
   hand of God, -- is at large expressed in the 16^th Psalm. "I have,"
   said he, "set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right
   hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory
   rejoiceth; my flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my
   soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
   corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life; in thy presence is
   fulness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore." He
   left his soul in the hand of God, in full assurance that it should
   suffer no evil in its state of separation, but should be brought again
   with his body into a blessed resurrection and eternal glory. So Stephen
   resigned his soul, departing under violence, into the hands of Christ
   himself. When he died he said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
				</p><p>
   This is the last victorious act of faith, wherein its conquest over its
   last enemy death itself does consist. Herein the soul says in and unto
   itself, "Thou art now taking leave of time unto eternity; all things
   about thee are departing as shades, and will immediately disappear. The
   things which thou art entering into are yet invisible; such as eye hath
   not seen, nor ear heard, nor will they enter into the heart of man
   fully to conceive.' Now, therefore, with quietness and confidence give
   up thyself unto the sovereign power, grace, truth, and faithfulness of
   God, and thou shalt find assured rest and peace."
				</p><p>
   But Jesus Christ it is who does immediately receive the souls of them
   who believe in him. So we see in the instance of Stephen. And what can
   be a greater encouragement to resign them into his hands, than a daily
   contemplation of his glory, in his person, his power, his exaltation,
   his office, and grace? Who that believes in him, that belongs unto him,
   can fear to commit his departing spirit unto his love, power, and care?
   Even we also shall hereby in our dying moments see by faith heaven
   opened, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God ready to receive
   us. This, added unto the love which all believers have unto the Lord
   Jesus, which is inflamed by contemplation of his glory, and their
   desires to be with him where he is, will strengthen and confine our
   minds in the resignation of our departing souls into his hand.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, It is required in us, unto the same end, that we be ready and
   willing to part with the flesh, wherewith we are clothed, with all
   things that are useful and desirable thereunto. The alliance, the
   relation, the friendship, the union that are between the soul and the
   body, are the greatest, the nearest, the firmest that are or can be
   among mere created beings. There is nothing like it, -- nothing equal
   unto it. The union of three persons in the one single divine nature,
   and the union of two natures in one person of Christ, are infinite,
   ineffable, and exempted from all comparison. But among created beings,
   the union of these two essential parts of the same nature in one person
   is most excellent. Nor is anything equal to it, or like it, found in
   any other creatures. Those who among them have most of life have either
   no body, as angels; or no souls but what perish with them, as all brute
   creatures below.
				</p><p>
   Angels, being pure, immaterial spirits, have nothing in them, nothing
   belonging unto their essence, that can die. Beasts have nothing in them
   that can live when their bodies die. The soul of a beast cannot be
   preserved in a separate condition, no, not by an act of almighty power;
   for it is not, and that which is not cannot live. It is nothing but the
   body itself in an act of its material powers.
				</p><p>
   Only the nature of man, in all the works of God, is capable of this
   convulsion. The essential parts of it are separable by death, the one
   continuing to exist and act its especial powers in a separate state or
   condition. The powers of the whole entire nature, acting in soul and
   body in conjunction, are all scattered and lost by death. But the
   powers of one essential part of the same nature -- that is, of the soul
   -- are preserved after death in a more perfect acting and exercise than
   before. This is peculiar unto human nature, as a mean partaking of
   heaven and earth, -- of the perfection of angels above, and of the
   imperfection of the beasts below. Only there is this difference in
   these things:  Our participation of the heavenly, spiritual
   perfections of the angelical nature is for eternity; our participation
   of the imperfections of the animate creatures here below is but for a
   season. For God hath designed our bodies unto such a glorious
   refinement at the resurrection, as that they shall have no more
   alliance unto that brutish nature which perisheth forever; for we shall
   be isangeloi -- like unto angels, or equal to them. Our bodies shall no
   more be capable of those acts and operations which are now common to us
   with other living creatures here below.
				</p><p>
   This is the pre-eminence of the nature of man, as the wise man
   declares. For unto that objection of atheistical Epicureans, "As the
   one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath: so that a
   man hath no pre-eminence above a beast. All go unto one place: all are
   of the dust, and all turn to the dust again," -- he grants that, as
   unto their bodies, it is for a season in them we have a present
   participation of their nature; but, says he, here lieth the difference,
   "Who knoweth the spirit of a man that goeth upward, and the spirit of
   the beast that goeth downward to the earth?" <reference osisRef="Eccl.3.21">Ecclesiastes 3:21</reference> Unless we
   know this, unless we consider the different state of the spirit of men
   and beasts, we cannot be delivered from this atheism; but the thoughts
   hereof will set us at liberty from it. They die in like manner, and
   their bodies go equally to the dust for a season; but the beast hath no
   spirit, no soul, but what dies with the body and goes to the dust. If
   they had, their bodies also must be raised again unto a conjunction
   with them; otherwise, death would produce a new race of creatures unto
   eternity. But man hath an immortal soul, saith he, a heavenly spirit,
   which, when the body goes in the dust for a season, ascends to heaven
   (where the guilt of sin and the curse of the law interpose not), from
   whence it is there to exist and to act all its native powers in a state
   of blessedness.
				</p><p>
   But, as I said, by reason of this peculiar intimate union and relation
   between the soul and body, there is in the whole nature a fixed
   aversion from a dissolution. The soul and body are naturally and
   necessarily unwilling to fall into a state of separation, wherein the
   one shall cease to be what it was, and the other knows not clearly how
   it shall subsist. The body claspeth about the soul, and the soul
   receiveth strange impressions from its embraces; the entire nature,
   existing in the union of them both, being unalterably averse unto a
   dissolution.
				</p><p>
   Wherefore, unless we can overcome this inclination, we can never die
   comfortably or cheerfully. We would, indeed, rather choose to be
   "clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life," that the
   clothing of glory might come on our whole nature, soul and body,
   without dissolution. But if this may not be, yet then do believers so
   conquer this inclination by faith and views of the glory of Christ, as
   to attain a desire of this dissolution. So the apostle testifies of
   himself, "I have a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is
   far better" than to abide here, <reference osisRef="Phil.1.23">Philippians 1:23</reference> Saith he, Ten epithumian
   echon, -- not an ordinary desire, not that which worketh in me now and
   then; but a constant, habitual inclination, working in vehement acts
   and desires. And what does he so desire? It is analusai, -- "to
   depart," say we, out of this body, from this tabernacle, to leave it
   for a season. But it is such a departure as consists in the dissolution
   of the present state of his being, that it should not be what it is.
   But how is it possible that a man should attain such an inclination
   unto, such a readiness for, such a vehement desire of, a dissolution?
   It is from a view by faith of Christ and his glory, whence the soul is
   satisfied that to be with him is incomparably better than in its
   present state and condition.
				</p><p>
   He, therefore, that would die comfortably, must be able to say within
   himself and to himself, "Die, then, thou frail and sinful flesh: dust
   thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.' I yield thee up unto the
   righteous doom of the Holy One. Yet herein also I give thee into the
   hand of the great Refiner, who will hide thee in thy grave, and by thy
   consumption purify thee from all thy corruption and disposition to
   evil. And otherwise this will not be. After a long sincere endeavour
   for the mortification of all sin, I find it will never be absolutely
   perfect, but by this reduction into the dust. Thou shalt no more be a
   residence for the least remnant of sin unto eternity, nor any clog unto
   my soul in its actings on God. Rest therefore in hope; for God, in his
   appointed season, when he shall have a desire unto the work of his
   hands, will call unto thee, and thou shalt answer him out of the dust.
   Then shall he, by an act of his almighty power, not only restore thee
   unto thy pristine glory, as at the first creation, when thou wast the
   pure workmanship of his hands, but enrich and adorn thee with
   inconceivable privileges and advantages. Be not, then, afraid; away
   with all reluctance. Go into the dust, -- rest in hope; for thou shalt
   stand in thy lot at the end of the days.'?"
				</p><p>
   That which will enable us hereunto, in an eminent manner, is that view
   and consideration of the glory of Christ which is the object of the
   ensuing Meditation. For He who is now possessed of all that glory
   underwent this dissolution of nature as truly and really as ever we
   shall do.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly, There is required hereunto a readiness to comply with the
   times and seasons wherein God would have us depart and leave this
   world. Many think they shall be willing to die when their time is come;
   but they have many reasons, as they suppose, to desire that it may not
   yet be, -- which, for the most part, arise merely from fear and
   aversion of death. Some desire to live that they may see more of that
   glorious world of God for his church, which they believe he will
   accomplish. So Moses prayed that he might not die in the wilderness,
   but go over Jordan, and see the good land, and that goodly mountain and
   Lebanon, the seat of the church, and of the worship of God; which yet
   God thought meet to deny unto him. And this denial of the request of
   Moses, made on the highest consideration possible, is instructive unto
   all in the like case. Others may judge themselves to have some work to
   do in the world, wherein they suppose that the glory of God and the
   good of the church are concerned; and therefore would be spared for a
   season. Paul knew not clearly whether it were not best for him to abide
   a while longer in the flesh on this account; and David often deprecates
   the present season of death because of the work which he had to do for
   God in the world. Others rise no higher than their own private
   interests or concerns with respect unto their persons, their families,
   their relations, and goods in this world. They would see these things
   in a better or more settled condition before they die, and then they
   shall be most willing so to do. But it is the love of life that lies at
   the bottom of all these desires in men; which of itself will never
   forsake them. But no man can die cheerfully or comfortably who lives
   not in a constant resignation of the time and season of his death unto
   the will of God, as well as himself with respect unto death itself. Our
   times are in his hand, at his sovereign disposal; and his will in all
   things must be complied withal. Without this resolution, without this
   resignation, no man can enjoy the least solid peace in this world.
				</p><p>
   Fourthly, As the times and seasons, so the ways and means of the
   approaches of death have especial trials; which, unless we are prepared
   for them, will keep us under bondage, with the fear of death itself.
   Long, wasting, wearing consumptions, burning fevers, strong pains of
   the stone, or the lice from within; or sword, fire, tortures, with
   shame and reproach from without, may be in the way of the access of
   death unto us. Some who have been wholly freed from all fears of death,
   as a dissolution of nature, who have looked on it as amiable and
   desirable in itself, have yet had great exercise in their minds about
   these ways of its approach: they have earnestly desired that this
   peculiar bitterness of the cup might be taken away. To get above all
   perplexities on the account of these things, is part of our wisdom in
   dying daily. And we are to have always in a readiness those graces and
   duties which are necessary thereunto. Such are a constant resignation
   of ourselves, in all events, unto the sovereign will, pleasure, and
   disposal of God. "May he not do what he will with his own?" Is it not
   right and meet it should be so? Is not his will in all things
   infinitely holy, wise, just, and good? Does he not know what is best
   for us, and what conduceth most unto his own glory? Does not he alone
   do so? So is it to live in the exercise of faith, that if God calls us
   unto any of those things which are peculiarly dreadful unto our
   natures, he will give us such supplies of spiritual strength and
   patience as shall enable us to undergo them, if not with ease and joy,
   yet with peace and quietness beyond our expectation. Multitudes have
   had experience that those things which, at a distance, have had an
   aspect of overwhelming dread, have been far from unsupportable in their
   approach, when strength has been received from above to encounter with
   them. And, moreover, it is in this case required that we be frequent
   and steady in comparing these things with those which are eternal both
   as unto the misery which we are freed from and that blessedness which
   is prepared for us. But I shall proceed no farther with these
   particulars.
				</p><p>
   There is none of all the things we have insisted on -- neither the
   resignation of a departing soul into the hand of God, nor a willingness
   to lay down this flesh in the dust, nor a readiness to comply with the
   will of God, as to the times and seasons, or the way and manner of the
   approach of death -- that can be attained unto, without a prospect of
   that glory that shall give us a new state far more excellent than what
   we here leave or depart from. This we cannot have, whatever we pretend,
   unless we have some present views of the glory of Christ. An
   apprehension of the future manifestation of it in heaven will not
   relieve us, if here we know not what it is, and wherein it does
   consist, -- if we have not some previous discovery of it in this life.
   This is that which will make all things easy and pleasant unto us, even
   death itself, as it is a means to bring us unto its full enjoyment.
				</p><p>
   Other great and glorious advantages, which may be obtained in the
   diligent discharge of the duty here proposed, might be insisted on, but
   that the things themselves discoursed of will evidently discover and
   direct us unto the spring and reasons of them; besides, weakness,
   weariness, and the near approaches of death do call me off from any
   farther labour in this kind.

<p>   [1] Dr Owen refers to the Emperor Hadrian, who, among other short poems
   which have been ascribed to him, is said to have composed , towards his
   death, the following lines:

<p>     "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
     where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given
     me." -- <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference>
				</p><p>
   The high priest under the law, when he was to enter into the holy place
   on the solemn day of atonement, was to take both his hands full of
   sweet incense from the golden table of incense, to carry along with him
   in his entrance. He had also a censer filled with fire, that was taken
   from the altar of burnt-offerings, where atonement was made for sin
   with blood. Upon his actual entrance through the veil, he put the
   incense on the fire in the censer until the cloud of its smoke covered
   the ark, and the mercy seat. See <reference osisRef="Lev.16.12 Lev.16.13">Leviticus 16:12-13</reference> And the end hereof
   was to present unto God, in the behalf of the people, a sweet-smelling
   savour from the sacrifice of propitiation. See the declaration of these
   things in our exposition of Heb. ix.
				</p><p>
   In answer unto this mystical type, the great High Priest of the church,
   our Lord Jesus Christ, being to enter into the "holy place not made
   with hands," did, by the glorious prayer recorded in this chapter,
   influenced from the blood of his sacrifice, fill the heavens above, the
   glorious place of God's residence, with a cloud of incense, or the
   sweet perfume of his blessed intercession, typed by the incense offered
   by the high priest of old. By the same eternal fire wherewith he
   offered himself a bloody sacrifice to make atonement for sin, he
   kindled in his most holy soul those desires for the application of all
   its benefits unto his church which are here expressed, and wherein his
   intercession does consist.
				</p><p>
   It is only one passage in the verse above named that at present I
   design an inquiry into. And this is the subject-matter of what the Lord
   Christ here desires in the behalf of those given him by the Father, --
   namely, that they may behold his glory.
				</p><p>
   It is evident that in this prayer the Lord Christ has respect unto his
   own glory and the manifestation of it, which he had in the entrance
   asked of the Father, verses 4, 5. But in this place he has not so much
   respect unto it as his own, as unto the advantage, benefit,
   satisfaction, and blessedness of his disciples, in the beholding of it.
   For these things were the end of all that mediatory glory which was
   given unto him. So Joseph charged his brethren, when he had revealed
   himself unto them, that they should tell his father of all his "glory
   in Egypt," <reference osisRef="Gen.45.13">Genesis 45:13</reference> This he did, not for an ostentation of his own
   glory, but for the satisfaction which he knew his father would take in
   the knowledge of it. And such a manifestation of his glory unto his
   disciples does the Lord Christ here desire, as might fill them with
   blessed satisfaction for evermore.
				</p><p>
   This alone, which is here prayed for, will give them such satisfaction,
   and nothing else. The hearts of believers are like the needle touched
   by the loadstone, which cannot rest until it comes to the point
   whereunto, by the secret virtue of it, it is directed. For being once
   touched by the love of Christ, receiving therein an impression of
   secret ineffable virtue, they will ever be in motion, and restless,
   until they come unto him, and behold his glory. That soul which can be
   satisfied without it, -- that cannot be eternally satisfied with it, --
   is not partaker of the efficacy of his intercession.
				</p><p>
   I shall lay the foundation of the ensuing Meditations in this one
   assertion, -- namely, That one of the greatest privileges and
   advancements of believers, both in this world and unto eternity,
   consists in their beholding the glory of Christ. This, therefore, He
   desires for them in this solemn intercession, as the complement of all
   his other requests in their behalf; -- "That they may behold my glory,"
   -- Hina theorosi, -- that they may see, view, behold, or contemplate on
   my glory. The reasons why I assign not this glorious privilege only
   unto the heavenly state, which is principally respected in this place,
   but apply it unto the state of believers in this world also, with their
   duties and privileges therein, shall be immediately declared.
				</p><p>
   All unbelievers do in their heart call Christ "Ichabod," -- "Where is
   the glory?" They see neither "form nor comeliness in him," that he
   should be desired. They look on him as Michal, Saul's daughter, did on
   David "dancing before the ark," when she despised him in her heart.
   They do not, indeed (many of them), "call Jesus anathema," but cry,
   "Hail, Master!" and then crucify him.
				</p><p>
   Hence have we so many cursed opinions advanced in derogation unto his
   glory, -- some of them really destructive of all that is truly so; yea,
   denying the "only Lord that bought us," and substituting a false Christ
   in his room. And others there are who express their slight thoughts of
   him and his glory by bold, irreverent inquiries, of what use his Person
   is in our religion; as though there were anything in our religion that
   has either reality, substance, or truth, but by virtue of its relation
   thereunto. And, by their answers, they bring their own inquiries yet
   nearer unto the borders of blasphemy.
				</p><p>
   Never was there an age since the name of Christians was known upon the
   earth, wherein there was such a direct opposition made unto the Person
   and glory of Christ, as there is in that wherein we live. There were,
   indeed, in the first times of the church, swarms of proud, doting,
   brain-sick persons, who vented many foolish imaginations about him,
   which issued at length in Arianism, in whose ruins they were buried.
   The gates of hell in them prevailed not against the rock on which the
   church is built. But as it was said of C�sar, "Solus accesit sobrius,
   ad perdendam rempublicam," -- "He alone went soberly about the
   destruction of the commonwealth;" so we now have great numbers who
   oppose the Person and glory of Christ, under a pretence of sobriety of
   reason, as they vainly plead. Yea, the disbelief of the mysteries of
   the Trinity, and the incarnation of the Son of God, -- the sole
   foundation of Christian religion, -- is so diffused in the world, as
   that it has almost devoured the power and vitals of it. And not a few,
   who dare not yet express their minds, do give broad intimations of
   their intentions and good-will towards him, in making them the object
   of their scorn and reproach who desire to know nothing but him, and him
   crucified.
				</p><p>
   God, in his appointed time, will effectually vindicate his honour and
   glory from the vain attempts of men of corrupt minds against them.
				</p><p>
   In the meantime, it is the duty of all those who "love the Lord Jesus
   in sincerity," to give testimony in a peculiar manner unto his divine
   Person and glory, according unto their several capacities, because of
   the opposition that is made against them.
				</p><p>
   I have thought myself on many accounts obliged to cast my mite into
   this treasury. And I have chosen so to do, not in a way of controversy
   (which formerly I have engaged in), but so as, together with the
   vindication of the truth, to promote the strengthening of the faith of
   true believers, their edification in the knowledge of it; and to
   express the experience which they have, or may have, of the power and
   reality of these things.
				</p><p>
   That which at present I design to demonstrate is, that the beholding of
   the glory of Christ is one of the greatest privileges and advancements
   that believers are capable of in this world, or that which is to come.
   It is that whereby they are first gradually conformed unto it, and then
   fixed in the eternal enjoyment of it. For here in this life, beholding
   his glory, they are changed or transformed into the likeness of it, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>; and hereafter they shall be "for ever like unto him,"
   because they "shall see him as he is," <reference osisRef="1John.3.1 1John.3.2">1 John 3:1-2</reference> Hereon do our
   present comforts and future blessedness depend. This is the life and
   reward of our souls. "He that has seen him has seen the Father also,"
   <reference osisRef="John.14.9">John 14:9</reference> For we discern the "light of the knowledge of the glory of
   God only in the face of Jesus Christ," <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   There are, therefore, two ways or degrees of beholding the glory of
   Christ, which are constantly distinguished in the Scripture. The one is
   by faith, in this world, -- which is "the evidence of things not seen;"
   the other is by sight, or immediate vision in eternity, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.7">2 Corinthians 5:7</reference>,
   "We walk by faith, and not by sight." We do so whilst we are in this
   world, "whilst we are present in the body, and absent from the Lord,"
   verse 8. But we shall live and walk by sight hereafter. And it is the
   Lord Christ and his glory which are the immediate object both of this
   faith and sight. For we here "behold him darkly in a glass" (that is by
   faith); "but we shall see him face to face" (by immediate vision). "Now
   we know him in part, but then we shall know him as we are known," <reference osisRef="1Cor.13.12">1 Corinthians 13:12</reference> What is the difference between these two ways of
   beholding the glory of Christ shall be afterward declared.
				</p><p>
   It is the second way -- namely, by vision in the light of glory -- that
   is principally included in that prayer of our blessed Saviour, that his
   disciples may be where he is, to behold his glory. But I shall not
   confine my inquiry thereunto; nor does our Lord Jesus exclude from his
   desire that sight of his glory which we have by faith in this world,
   but prays for the perfection of it in heaven. It is therefore the first
   way that, in the first place, I shall insist upon; and that for the
   reasons ensuing: 
				</p><p>
   1. No man shall ever behold the glory of Christ by sight hereafter, who
   does not in some measure behold it by faith here in this world. Grace
   is a necessary preparation for glory, and faith for sight. Where the
   subject (the soul) is not previously seasoned with grace and faith, it
   is not capable of glory or vision. Nay, persons not disposed hereby
   unto it cannot desire it, whatever they pretend; they only deceive
   their own souls in supposing that so they do. Most men will say with
   confidence, living and dying, that they desire to be with Christ, and
   to behold his glory; but they can give no reason why they should desire
   any such thing, -- only they think it somewhat that is better than to
   be in that evil condition which otherwise they must be cast into for
   ever, when they can be here no more. If a man pretend himself to be
   enamoured on, or greatly to desire, what he never saw, nor was ever
   represented unto him, he does but dote on his own imaginations. And the
   pretended desires of many to behold the glory of Christ in heaven, who
   have no view of it by faith whilst they are here in this world, are
   nothing but self-deceiving imaginations.
				</p><p>
   So do the Papists delude themselves. Their carnal affections are
   excited by their outward senses to delight in images of Christ, -- in
   his sufferings, his resurrection, and glory above. Hereon they satisfy
   themselves that they behold the glory of Christ himself and that with
   love and great delight. But whereas there is not the least true
   representation made of the Lord Christ or his glory in these things, --
   that being confined absolutely unto the Gospel alone, and this way of
   attempting it being laid under a severe interdict, -- they do but sport
   themselves with their own deceivings.
				</p><p>
   The apostle tells us concerning himself and other believers, when the
   Lord Christ was present and conversed with them in the days of his
   flesh, that they "saw his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of
   the Father, full of grace and truth," <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference> And we may inquire,
   what was this glory of Christ which they so saw, and by what means they
   obtained a prospect of it. For, -- 1. It was not the glory of his
   outward condition, as we behold the glory and grandeur of the kings and
   potentates of the earth; for he made himself of no reputation, but
   being in the form of a servant, he walked in the condition of a man of
   low degree. The secular grandeur of his pretended Vicar makes no
   representation of that glory of his which his disciples saw. He kept no
   court, nor house of entertainment, nor (though he made all things) had
   of his own where to lay his head. Nor, -- 2. Was it with respect to the
   outward form of the flesh which he was made, wherein he took our nature
   on him, as we see the glory of a comely or beautiful person; -- for he
   had therein neither form nor comeliness that he should be desired, "his
   visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons
   of men," <reference osisRef="Isa.52.14">Isaiah 52:14</reference>; liii. 2, 3. All things appeared in him as became
   "a man of sorrows." Nor, -- 3. Was it absolutely the eternal essential
   glory of his divine nature that is intended; for this no man can see in
   this world. What we shall attain in a view thereof hereafter we know
   not. But, -- 4. It was his glory, as he was "full of grace and truth."
   They saw the glory of his person and his office in the administration
   of grace and truth. And how or by what means did they see this glory of
   Christ? It was by faith, and no otherwise; for this privilege was
   granted unto them only who "received him," and believed on his name,
   <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference> This was that glory which the Baptist saw, when, upon his
   coming unto him he said unto all that were present, "Behold the Lamb of
   God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" verses 29-33.
				</p><p>
   Wherefore let no man deceive himself; he that has no sight of the glory
   of Christ here, shall never have any of it hereafter unto his
   advantage. It is not, therefore, unto edification to discourse of
   beholding the glory of Christ in heaven by vision, until we go through
   a trial whether we see anything of it in this world by faith or no.
				</p><p>
   2. The beholding of Christ in glory is that which in itself is too
   high, illustrious, and marvellous for us in our present condition. It
   has a splendour and glory too great for our present spiritual visible
   [visive] faculty; as the direct, immediate sight of the sun darkens our
   sight, and does not relieve or strengthen it at all. Wherefore we have
   no way to take into our minds any true spiritual apprehensions of the
   nature of immediate vision, or what it is to see the glory of Christ in
   heaven, but by that view which we have by faith in this life of the
   same glory. Whatever otherwise falls into our minds is but conjecture
   and imagination; such as are the contemplations of most about heavenly
   things.
				</p><p>
   I have seen and read somewhat of the writings of learned men concerning
   the state of future glory; some of them are filled with excellent
   notions of truth, and elegance of speech, whereby they cannot but much
   affect the minds of them who duly consider what they say. But I know
   not well whence it comes to pass, many complain that, in reading of
   such discourses, they are like a man who "beholds his natural face in a
   glass, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was;" as one of
   old complained to the same purpose upon his perusal of Plato's
   contemplations about the immortality of the soul. The things spoken do
   not abide nor incorporate with our minds. They please and refresh for a
   little while, like a shower of rain in a dry season, that soaketh not
   unto the roots of things; the power of them does not enter into us. Is
   it not all from hence, that their notions of future things are not
   educed out of the experience which we have of the beginnings of them in
   this world? without which they can make no permanent abode in our
   minds, nor continue any influence upon our affections. Yea, the soul is
   disturbed, not edified, in all contemplations of future glory, when
   things are proposed unto it whereof in this life it has neither
   foretaste, sense, experience, nor evidence. No man ought to look for
   anything in heaven, but what one way or other he has some experience of
   in this life. If men were fully persuaded hereof, they would be, it may
   be, more in the exercise of faith and love about heavenly things than
   for the most part they are. At present they know not what they enjoy,
   and they look for they know not what.
				</p><p>
   Hence is it that men, utterly strangers unto all experience of the
   beginning of glory in themselves as an effect of faith, have filled
   their divine worship with images, pictures, and music, to represent
   unto themselves somewhat of that glory which they fancy to be above.
   For into that which is truly so, they have no prospect, or can have;
   because they have no experience of its power in themselves, nor do they
   taste of its goodness by any of its first-fruits in their own minds.
   Wherefore by that view alone, and not otherwise, which we have of the
   glory of Christ by faith here in this world, we may attain such blessed
   conceptions of our beholding his glory above by immediate vision, as
   shall draw out our hearts unto the admiration of it and desires of its
   full enjoyment.
				</p><p>
   3. Herein, then, our present edification is principally concerned; for
   in this present beholding of the glory of Christ, the life and power of
   faith are most eminently acted. And from this exercise of faith does
   love unto Christ principally, if not solely, arise and spring. If,
   therefore, we desire to have faith in its vigour or love in its power,
   giving rest, complacency, and satisfaction unto our own souls, we are
   to seek for them in the diligent discharge of this duty; -- elsewhere
   they will not be found. Herein would I live; -- herein would I die; --
   hereon would I dwell in my thoughts and affections, to the withering
   and consumption of all the painted beauties of this world, unto the
   crucifying all things here below, until they become unto me a dead and
   deformed thing, no way meet for affectionate embraces.
				</p><p>
   For these and the like reasons I shall first inquire into our beholding
   of the glory of Christ in this world by faith; and therein endeavour to
   lead the souls of them that believe into the more retired walks of
   faith, love, and holy meditation, "whereby the King is held in the
   galleries," <reference osisRef="Song.7.5">Song of Solomon 7:5</reference>
				</p><p>
   But because there is no benefit in, nor advantage by, the contemplation
   of this sacred truth, but what consists in an improvement of the
   practice of the duty declared in it, -- namely, the constant beholding
   of the glory of Christ by faith, -- I shall for the promotion of it,
   premise some few advantages which we may have thereby.
				</p><p>
   1. We shall hereby be made fit and meet for heaven. Every man is not so
   who desires it, and hopes for it; for some are not only unworthy of it,
   and excluded from it, by reason of sin, but they are unmeet for it, and
   incapable of any advantage by it. All men, indeed, think themselves fit
   enough for glory (what should hinder them?) if they could attain it;
   but it is because they know not what it is. Men shall not be clothed
   with glory, as it were, whether they will or no. It is to be received
   in that exercise of the faculties of their souls which such persons
   have no ability for. Music has no pleasure in it unto them that cannot
   hear; nor the most beautiful colours, unto them that cannot see. It
   would be no benefit unto a fish, to take him from the bottom of the
   ocean, filled with cold and darkness, and to place him under the beams
   of the sun; for he is no way meet to receive any refreshment thereby.
   Heaven itself would not be more advantageous unto persons not renewed
   by the Spirit of grace in this life.
				</p><p>
   Hence the apostle gives "thanks unto the Father, who has made us meet
   to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light," <reference osisRef="Col.1.12">Colossians 1:12</reference>
   Indeed, the beginning here, and the fulness of glory hereafter, are
   communicated unto believers, by an almighty act of the will and grace
   of God. But yet he has ordained ways, and means, whereby they may be
   made meet receptive subjects of the glory so to be communicated unto
   them. That this way and means is by the beholding of the glory of
   Christ by faith shall be fully declared in our progress. This,
   therefore, should excite us unto this duty; for all our present glory
   consists, in our preparation for future glory.
				</p><p>
   2. No man can by faith take a real view of this glory, but virtue will
   proceed from it in a transforming power to change him "into the same
   image," <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> How this is done, and how we become like unto
   Christ by beholding his glory, shall be fully declared in our progress.
				</p><p>
   3. The constant contemplation of the glory of Christ will give rest,
   satisfaction, and complacency unto the souls of them who are exercised
   therein. Our minds are apt to be filled with a multitude of perplexed
   thoughts; -- fears, cares, dangers, distresses, passions, and lusts, do
   make various impressions on the minds of men, filling them with
   disorder, darkness, and confusion. But where the soul is fixed in its
   thoughts and contemplations on this glorious object, it will be brought
   into and kept in a holy, serene, spiritual frame. For "to be
   spiritually-minded is life and peace." And this it does by taking off
   our hearts from all undue regard unto all things below, in comparison
   of the great worth, beauty, and glory of what we are conversant withal.
   See <reference osisRef="Phil.3.7 Phil.3.8 Phil.3.9 Phil.3.10 Phil.3.11">Philippians 3:7-11</reference> A defect herein makes many of us strangers unto a
   heavenly life, and to live beneath the spiritual refreshments and
   satisfactions that the Gospel does tender unto us.
				</p><p>
   4. The sight of the glory of Christ is the spring and cause of our
   everlasting blessedness. "We shall ever be with the Lord," <reference osisRef="1Thess.4.17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</reference>, or "be with Christ," which is best of all, <reference osisRef="Phil.1.23">Philippians 1:23</reference> For there
   shall we "behold his glory," <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference>; and by "seeing him as he
   is, we shall be made like him," <reference osisRef="1John.3.2">1 John 3:2</reference>; -- which is our
   everlasting blessedness.
				</p><p>
   The enjoyment of God by sight is commonly called the beatifical vision;
   and it is the sole fountain of all the actings of our souls in the
   state of blessedness: which the old philosophers knew nothing of;
   neither do we know distinctly what they are, or what is this sight of
   God. Howbeit, this we know, that God in his immense essence is
   invisible unto our corporeal eyes, and will be so to eternity; as also
   incomprehensible unto our minds. For nothing can perfectly comprehend
   that which is infinite, but what is itself infinite. Wherefore the
   blessed and blessing sight which we shall have of God will be always
   "in the face of Jesus Christ." Therein will that manifestation of the
   glory of God, in his infinite perfections, and all their blessed
   operations, so shine into our souls, as shall immediately fill us with
   peace, rest, and glory.
				</p><p>
   These things we here admire, but cannot comprehend. We know not well
   what we say when we speak of them: yet is there in true believers a
   foresight and foretaste of this glorious condition. There enters
   sometimes, by the Word and Spirit, into their hearts such a sense of
   the uncreated glory of God, shining forth in Christ, as affects and
   satiates their souls with ineffable joy. Hence ariseth that "peace of
   God which passeth all understanding," keeping "our hearts and minds
   through Jesus Christ," <reference osisRef="Phil.4.7">Philippians 4:7</reference> "Christ," in believers, "the hope
   of glory," gives them to taste of the first-fruits of it; yea,
   sometimes to bathe their souls in the fountain of life, and to drink of
   the rivers of pleasure that are at his right hand. Where any are
   utterly unacquainted with these things, they are carnal, yes, blind,
   and see nothing afar off. These enjoyments, indeed, are rare, and for
   the most part of short continuance. "Rara hora, brevis mora." But it is
   from our own sloth and darkness that we do not enjoy more visits of
   this grace, and that the dawnings of glory do not more shine on our
   souls. Such things as these may excite us to diligence in the duty
   proposed unto us.
				</p><p>
   And I shall inquire, -- 1. What is that glory of Christ which we do or
   may behold by faith? 2. How do we behold it? 3. Wherein our doing so
   differs from immediate vision in heaven? And in the whole we shall
   endeavour an answer unto the inquiry made unto the spouse, by the
   daughters of Jerusalem, <reference osisRef="Song.5.9">Song of Solomon 5:9</reference>, "What is thy beloved more than
   another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more
   than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?"
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 2 The glory of the person of Christ as the only representative of God unto the church">
<title>Chapter 2 The glory of the person of Christ as the only representative of God unto the church</title>
<p>   The glory of Christ is the glory of the person of Christ. So he calls
   it Ten doxan ten emen, <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference>, "That glory which is mine," which
   belongeth to me, unto my person.
				</p><p>
   The person of Christ may be considered two ways:  1. Absolutely in
   itself. 2. In the susception and discharge of his office, with what
   ensued thereon. His glory on these distinct accounts is distinct and
   different; but all equally his own. How in both respects we may behold
   it by faith, is that which we inquire into.
				</p><p>
   The first thing wherein we may behold the glory of the person of
   Christ, God and man, which was given him of his Father, consists in the
   representation of the nature of God, and of the divine person of the
   Father, unto the church in him; for we behold "the glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ," <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference> Otherwise we know it not, we see
   it not, we see nothing of it; that is the way of seeing and knowing
   God, declared in the Scripture as our duty and blessedness. The glory
   of God comprehends both the holy properties of his nature and the
   counsels of his will; and "the light of the knowledge" of these things
   we have only "in the face" or person "of Jesus Christ." Whatever
   obscure, imperfect notions we may have of them in other ways, we cannot
   have photismon tes gnoseos tes doxes tou Thoou, "the light of the"
   illuminating, irradiating "knowledge of the glory of God," which may
   enlighten our minds and sanctify your hearts, but only en prosopo, "in
   the face" or person "of Jesus Christ:" for he is "the image of God," <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:4</reference>; "the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express
   image of his person," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>; "the image of the invisible God," <reference osisRef="Col.1.15">Colossians 1:15</reference> I do here only mention these things because I have handled them
   at large in my discourse of the "Mystery of Godliness," or the Person
   of Christ; whereunto I refer the readers for their full declaration and
   vindication. Herein is he glorious, in that he is the great
   representative of the nature of God and his will unto us; which without
   him would have been eternally hid from us, or been invisible unto us,
   -- we should never have seen God at any time, here nor hereafter, <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference>
				</p><p>
   In his divine person absolutely considered, he is the essential image
   of God, even the Father. He is in the Father, and the Father in him, in
   the unity of the same divine essence, <reference osisRef="John.14.10">John 14:10</reference> Now he is with the
   Father, <reference osisRef="John.1.1">John 1:1</reference>, in the distinction of his person, so is he his
   essential image, <reference osisRef="Col.1.15">Colossians 1:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference> In his incarnation he becomes
   the representative image of God unto the church, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>; without
   whom our understandings can make no such approach unto the divine
   excellencies but that God continues to be unto us what he is in
   himself, -- the "invisible God." In the face of Jesus Christ we see his
   glory.
				</p><p>
   This is the original glory of Christ, given him by his Father, and
   which by faith we may behold. He, and he alone, declares, represents,
   and makes known, unto angels and men, the essential glory of the
   invisible God, his attributes and his will; without which, a perpetual
   comparative darkness would have been the whole creation, especially
   that part of it here below.
				</p><p>
   This is the foundation of our religion, the Rock whereon the church is
   built, the ground of all our hopes of salvation, of life and
   immortality: all is resolved into this, -- namely, the representation
   that is made of the nature and will of God in the person and office of
   Christ. If this fail us, we are lost for ever; if this Rock stand firm,
   the church is safe here, and shall be triumphant hereafter.
				</p><p>
   Herein, then, is the Lord Christ exceedingly glorious. Those who cannot
   behold this glory of his by faith, -- namely, as he is the great divine
   ordinance to represent God unto us, -- they know him not. In their
   worship of him, they worship but an image of their own devising.
				</p><p>
   Yea, in the ignorance and neglect hereof consists the formal nature of
   unbelief, even that which is inevitably ruinous unto the souls of men.
   He that discerns not the representation of the glory of God in the
   person of Christ unto the souls of men, is an unbeliever. Such was the
   state of the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles of old; they did not, they
   would not, they could not, behold the glory of God in him, nor how he
   did represent him. That this was both the cause and the formal nature
   of their unbelief, the apostle declares at large, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.21 1Cor.1.22 1Cor.1.23 1Cor.1.24 1Cor.1.25">1 Corinthians 1:21-25</reference> Not
   to see the wisdom of God, and the power of God, and consequently all
   the other holy properties of his nature, in Christ, is to be an
   unbeliever.
				</p><p>
   The essence of faith consists in a due ascription of glory to God, <reference osisRef="Rom.4.20">Romans 4:20</reference> This we cannot attain unto without the manifestation of those
   divine excellencies unto us wherein he is glorious. This is done in
   Christ alone, so as that we may glorify God in a saving and acceptable
   manner. He who discerns not the glory of divine wisdom, power,
   goodness, love, and grace, in the person and office of Christ, with the
   way of the salvation of sinners by him, is an unbeliever.
				</p><p>
   Hence the great design of the devil, in the beginning of the preaching
   of the gospel, was to blind the eyes of men, and fill their minds with
   prejudices, that they might not behold this glory of his; so the
   apostle gives an account of his success in this design, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.3 2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</reference>, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid unto them that are lost: in whom
   the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them." By various ways and methods of deceit, to
   secure the reputation he had got of being "god of this world," by
   pretences and appearances of supernatural power and wisdom, he laboured
   to blind the eyes of men with prejudices against that glorious light of
   the gospel which proposed the Lord Christ as the only image of God.
   This blindness, this darkness is cured in them that believe, by the
   mighty power of God; for God, who commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness, has irradiated our hearts with the knowledge of the glory of
   God in the face of Jesus Christ, verse 6, -- wherein true saving faith
   does consist. Under this darkness perished the unbelieving world of
   Jews and Gentiles: and such is the present condition of all by whom the
   divine person of Christ is denied; for no mere creature can ever make a
   perfect representation of God unto us. But we must a little farther
   inquire into this mystery.
				</p><p>
   I. Since men fell from God by sin, it is no small part of their misery
   and punishment, that they are covered with thick darkness and ignorance
   of the nature of God. They know him not, they have not seen him at any
   time. Hence is that promise to the church in Christ, <reference osisRef="Isa.60.2">Isaiah 60:2</reference>, "For,
   behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the
   people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen
   upon thee."
				</p><p>
   The ancient philosophers made great inquiries into, and obtained many
   notions of, the Divine Being -- its existence and excellencies. And
   these notions they adorned with great elegance of speech, to allure
   others unto the admiration of them. Hereon they boasted themselves to
   be the only wise men in the world, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.22">Romans 1:22</reference>, phaskontes einai sophoi,
   -- they boasted that they were the wise. But we must abide in the
   judgment of the apostle concerning them in their inquiries; he assures
   us that the world in its wisdom -- that is, these wise men in it by
   their wisdom -- knew not God, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.21">1 Corinthians 1:21</reference> And he calls the authors of
   their best notions, Atheists, or men "without God in the world," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.12">Ephesians 2:12</reference> For, --
				</p><p>
   1. They had no certain guide, rule, nor light, which, being attended
   unto, might lead them infallibly into the knowledge of the divine
   nature. All they had of this kind was their own logismoi, their
   reasonings or imaginations; whereby they commenced suzetetai tou aionos
   toutou, "the great disputes of the world;" but in them they "waxed
   vain, and their foolish heart was darkened," <reference osisRef="Rom.1.21">Romans 1:21</reference> They did at
   best but endeavour pselaphan, "to feel after God," as men do in the
   dark after what they cannot clearly discern, <reference osisRef="Acts.17.27">Acts 17:27</reference> Among
   others, Cicero's book, "De Natura Deorum," gives us an exact account of
   the intention of the apostle in that expression. And it is at this day
   not want of wit, but hatred of the mysteries of our religion, which
   makes so many prone to forego all supernatural revelation, and to
   betake themselves unto a religion declared, as they suppose, by reason
   and the light of nature; -- like bats and owls, who, being not able to
   bear the light of the sun, betake themselves unto the twilight, to the
   dawnings of light and darkness.
				</p><p>
   2. Whatever they did attain, as unto rational notions about things
   invisible and incomprehensible, yet could they never deliver themselves
   from such principles and practices in idolatry and all manner of
   flagitious sins, as that they could be of any benefit unto them. This
   is so effectually demonstrated by the apostle in the 1st chapter of the
   Epistle to the Romans, as that we need not to insist upon it.
				</p><p>
   Men may talk what they please of a light within them, or of the power
   of reason to conduct them unto that knowledge of God whereby they may
   live unto him; but if they had nothing else, if they did not boast
   themselves of that light which has its foundation and original in
   divine revelation alone, they would not excel them who, in the best
   management of their own reasonings, "knew not God," but waxed vain in
   their imaginations.
				</p><p>
   With respect unto this universal darkness, -- that is, ignorance of
   God, with horrid confusion accompany it in the minds of men, -- Christ
   is called, and is, the "light of men," the "light of the world;"
   because in and by him alone this darkness is dispelled, as he is the
   "Sun of Righteousness."
				</p><p>
   II. This darkness in the minds of men, this ignorance of God, his
   nature and his will, was the original of all evil unto the world, and
   yet continues so to be. For, --
				</p><p>
   1. Hereon did Satan erect his kingdom and throne, obtaining in his
   design until he bare himself as "the god of this world," and was so
   esteemed by the most. He exalted himself by virtue of this darkness (as
   he is the "prince of darkness") into the place and room of God, as the
   object of the religious worship of men. For the things which the
   Gentiles sacrificed they sacrificed unto devils, and not to God, <reference osisRef="1Cor.10.20">1 Corinthians 10:20</reference>; <reference osisRef="Lev.17.7">Leviticus 17:7</reference>; <reference osisRef="Deut.32.17">Deuteronomy 32:17</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.106.37">Psalms 106:37</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.4.8">Galatians 4:8</reference> This is
   the territory of Satan; yea, the power and sceptre of his kingdom in
   the minds of the "children of disobedience." Hereby he maintains his
   dominion unto this day in many and great nations, and with individual
   persons innumerable.
				</p><p>
   2. This is the spring of all wickedness and confusion among men
   themselves. Hence arose that flood of abominations in the old world,
   which God took away with a flood of desolation: hence were the sins of
   Sodom and Gomorrah, which he revenged with "fire from heaven." In
   brief; all the rage, blood, confusion, desolations, cruelties,
   oppressions, villainies, which the world has been and is filled withal,
   whereby the souls of men have been and are flooded into eternal
   destruction, have all arisen from this corrupt fountain of the
   ignorance of God.
				</p><p>
   3. Of such as those described we are the posterity and offspring. Our
   forefathers in this nation were given up unto as brutish a service of
   the devil as any nation under the sun. It is therefore an effect of
   infinite mercy, that the day has dawned on us, poor Gentiles, and that
   the "day-spring from on high hath visited us." See the glory of this
   grace expressed, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.5 Eph.3.6 Eph.3.7 Eph.3.8 Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:5-10</reference> God might have left us to perish in
   the blindness and ignorance of our forefathers; but of his own accord,
   and by his own powerful grace alone, he has "translated us out of
   darkness into his marvellous light." But, alas! the horrible
   ingratitude of men for the glorious light of the Gospel, and the abuse
   of it, will issue in a sore revenge.
				</p><p>
   God was known under the Old Testament by the revelation of his Word,
   and the institution of his worship. This was the glory and privilege of
   Israel, as the Psalmist declares, <reference osisRef="Ps.147.19 Ps.147.20">Psalms 147:19-20</reference>, "He showeth his
   word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath
   not dealt so with any nation." The church then knew him; yet so as that
   they had an apprehension that he dwelt in "thick darkness," where they
   could not have any clear views of him, <reference osisRef="Exod.20.21">Exodus 20:21</reference>; <reference osisRef="Deut.5.22">Deuteronomy 5:22</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Kgs.8.12">1 Kings 8:12</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Chr.6.1">2 Chronicles 6:1</reference> And the reason why God so represented
   himself in darkness unto them, was, to instruct them in their imperfect
   state, wherein they could not comprehend that glory which should
   afterward be revealed. For as he is now made known in Christ, we see
   that "he is light, and in him there is no darkness at all."
				</p><p>
   4. Hitherto darkness in general covered the earth, and gross darkness
   the people, as unto the knowledge of God; only there was a twilight in
   the church. The day did not yet dawn, the "shadows did not flee away,"
   nor the "day-star shine" in the hearts of men. But when the "Sun of
   Righteousness" did arise in his strength and beauty, when the Son of
   God "appeared in the flesh," and in the discharge of his office, -- God
   himself, as unto his being, and manner of existence in three distinct
   persons, with all the glorious properties of the divine nature, was
   illustriously manifested unto them that did believe; and the light of
   the knowledge of them dispelled all the shadows that were in the
   church, and shone into the darkness which was in the world, so as that
   none continued ignorant of God but those who would not see. See <reference osisRef="John.1.5 John.1.14 John.1.17 John.1.18">John 1:5, 14, 17-18</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.3 2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   Herein is the Lord Christ glorious. And this is that which I shall now
   speak unto, -- namely, how we may behold the glory of Christ in the
   representation and revelation that is made of God and his glory, in his
   person and office, unto all that do believe. For it is not so much the
   declaration of the nature of the things themselves, wherein the glory
   of Christ does consist, as our way and duty in the beholding of them,
   which at present is designed.
				</p><p>
   He calls unto us, saying, "Behold me, -- look unto me, -- and be
   saved," <reference osisRef="Isa.45.22">Isaiah 45:22</reference> What is it that we see in Christ? what do we
   behold in him? He asketh that question concerning his church, "What
   will ye see in the Shulamite?" Whereto he answers, "As it were the
   company of two armies," <reference osisRef="Song.6.13">Song of Solomon 6:13</reference>; or the two churches of the Old
   and New Testament, in order and beauty. We may inquire, What shall we,
   what do we see in him? Do we see him as "the image of the invisible
   God," representing him, his nature, properties, and will unto us? Do we
   see him as the "character," the "express image of the person of the
   Father," so that we have no need of Philip's request, "Lord, show us
   the Father?" because having seen him, we have seen the Father also,
   <reference osisRef="John.14.9">John 14:9</reference>
				</p><p>
   This is our first saving view of Christ, the first instance of our
   beholding his glory by faith. So to see him as to see God in him, is to
   behold his glory; for herein he is eternally glorious. And this is that
   glory whose view we ought to long for and labour after. And if we see
   it not, we are yet in darkness; yea, though we say we see, we are blind
   like others. So David longed and prayed for it, when yet he could
   behold it only in types and shadows, <reference osisRef="Ps.63.1 Ps.63.2">Psalms 63:1-2</reference>, "O God, thou art
   my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh
   longeth for thee; -- to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen
   thee in the sanctuary." For there was in the sanctuary an obscure
   representation of the glory of God in Christ. How much more should we
   prize that view of it which we may have with open face, though yet "as
   in a glass!" <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>
				</p><p>
   Moses, when he had seen the works of God, which were great and
   marvellous, yet found not himself satisfied therewith; wherefore, after
   all, he prays that God "would show him his glory", <reference osisRef="Exod.33.18">Exodus 33:18</reference> He
   knew that the ultimate rest, blessedness, and satisfaction of the soul,
   is not in seeing the works of God, but the glory of God himself.
   Therefore did he desire some immediate dawnings of it upon him in this
   world: "I beseech thee, show me thy glory." And if we have right
   apprehensions of the future state of blessedness, we cannot but have
   the same desire of seeing more of his glory in this life. But the
   question is, How we may attain it? If we are left unto ourselves in
   this inquiry, if we have no other way for it but the immediate rising
   of our thoughts on the immensity of the divine nature, we must come
   every one to the conclusion that Agur makes on the like consideration,
   "Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding
   of a man. I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
   Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? who has gathered the
   wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has
   established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is
   his son's name, if thou canst tell?" <reference osisRef="Prov.30.2 Prov.30.3 Prov.30.4">Proverbs 30:2-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   It is in Christ alone that we may have a clear, distinct view of the
   glory of God and his excellencies. For him, and him alone, has he
   appointed the representative of himself unto us; and we shall take an
   account hereof in one or two especial instances. See <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference>, xiv.
   7-10; <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.1.15">Colossians 1:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.3.4 Eph.3.5 Eph.3.6 Eph.3.7 Eph.3.8 Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:4-10</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   1. Infinite wisdom is one of the most glorious properties of the divine
   nature; it is that which is directive of all the external works of God,
   wherein the glory of all the other excellencies of God is manifested:
   wherefore the manifestation of the whole glory of God proceeds
   originally from infinite wisdom. But, as Job speaks, "Where shall
   [this] wisdom be found; and what is the place of understanding? chap.
   xxviii. 12. "Can we by searching find out God? can we find out the
   Almighty unto perfection?" chap. xi. 7. As it is in itself an
   essential, eternal property of the divine nature, we can have no
   comprehension of it, -- we can but adore it in that infinite distance
   wherein we stand from God; but in its operations and effects it may be
   discerned, for they are designed of God for its manifestation. Among
   these, the most excellent is the contrivance of the great work of the
   salvation of the church. So it is celebrated by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:9-10</reference>, "To make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
   which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created
   all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now, unto the
   principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the
   church the manifold wisdom of God."
				</p><p>
   If we have any interest in God, if we have any hopes of blessedness in
   beholding of his glory unto eternity, we cannot but desire a view (such
   as is attainable) of this infinite, manifold wisdom of God in this
   life. But it is in Christ alone that we can discern anything of it; for
   him has the Father chosen and sealed to represent it unto us. All the
   treasures of this wisdom are hid, laid up, and laid out in him; --
   herein lies the essence and form of faith. Believers by it do see the
   wisdom of God in Christ, in his person and office, -- Christ the wisdom
   of God. Unbelievers see it not, as the apostle argues, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.22 1Cor.1.23 1Cor.1.24">1 Corinthians 1:22-24</reference>
				</p><p>
   In beholding the glory of this infinite wisdom of God in Christ, we
   behold his own glory also, -- the glory given him of his Father; for
   this is his glory, that in and by him, and him alone, the wisdom of God
   is manifested and represented unto us. When God appointed him as the
   great and only means of this end, he gave him honour and glory above
   the whole creation; for it is but little of divine wisdom which the
   works of it declare, in comparison of what is manifested in Christ
   Jesus. We no way deny or extenuate the manifestation that is made of
   the wisdom of God in the works of creation and providence. It is
   sufficient to detect the folly of atheism and idolatry; and was
   designed of God unto that end. But its comparative insufficiency --
   with respect unto the representation of it in Christ as to the ends of
   knowing God aright and living unto him -- the Scripture does abundantly
   attest. And the abuse of it was catholic [i. e., universal], as the
   apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.20">Romans 1:20</reference>, etc.. To see this wisdom clearly is our
   wisdom; and a due apprehension of it fills the souls of believers "with
   joy unspeakable, and full of glory."
				</p><p>
   2. We may also instance in the love of God. The apostle tells us that
   "God is love," <reference osisRef="1John.4.8">1 John 4:8</reference> Divine love is not to be considered only
   in its effects, but in its nature and essence; and so it is God
   himself, for "God is love." And a blessed revelation this is of the
   divine nature; it casts out envy, hatred, malice, revenge, with all
   their fruits, in rage, fierceness, implacability, persecution, murder,
   into the territories of Satan. They belong not unto God in his nature
   or acting; for "God is love." So the same apostle tells us, that he who
   "slew his brother was of the wicked one," <reference osisRef="1John.3.12">1 John 3:12</reference> He was of the
   devil, his father, and his works did he do.
				</p><p>
   But the inquiry is as before, -- How shall we have a view of this love,
   of God as love? by what way or means shall we behold the glory of it?
   It is hidden from all living, in God himself. The wise philosophers,
   who discoursed so much of the love of God, knew nothing of this, that
   "God is love." The most of the natural notions of men about it are
   corrupt, and the best of them weak and imperfect. Generally, the
   thoughts of men about it are, that he is of a facile and easy nature,
   one that they may make bold withal in all their occasions; as the
   Psalmist declares, <reference osisRef="Ps.50.21">Psalms 50:21</reference> And whereas it must be learned in its
   effects, operations, and divine ways of its manifestation, those who
   know not Christ know nothing of them. And many things in providence do
   interpose to hinder our views of this love; -- for although, indeed,
   "God is love," yet "his wrath is revealed from heaven against the
   ungodliness of men;" as all things at this day are filled with
   evidences of his anger and displeasure. How, then, shall we know,
   wherein shall we behold, the glory of God in this, that he is love? The
   apostle declares it in the next words, <reference osisRef="1John.4.9">1 John 4:9</reference>, "In this was
   manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his
   only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him." This
   is the only evidence given us that "God is love." Hereby alone is the
   divine nature as such made known unto us, -- namely, in the mission,
   person, and office of the Son of God; without this, all is in darkness
   as unto the true nature and supreme operation of this divine love.
				</p><p>
   Herein do we behold the glory of Christ himself, even in this life.
   This glory was given him of the Father, -- namely, that he now should
   declare and evidence that "God is love;" and he did so, "that in all
   things he might have the pre-eminence." Herein we may see how
   excellent, how beautiful, how glorious and desirable he is, seeing in
   him alone we have a due representation of God as he is love; which is
   the most joyful sight of God that any creature can obtain. He who
   beholds not the glory of Christ herein is utterly ignorant of those
   heavenly mysteries; -- he knoweth neither God nor Christ, -- he has
   neither the Father nor the Son. He knows not God, because he knows not
   the holy properties of his nature in the principal way designed by
   infinite wisdom for their manifestation; he knows not Christ, because
   he sees not the glory of God in him. Wherefore, whatever notions men
   may have from the light of nature, or from the works of Providence,
   that there is love in God, -- however they may adorn them in elegant,
   affecting expressions, -- yet from them no man can know that "God is
   love." In the revelation hereof Christ has the pre-eminence; nor can
   any man comprehend anything of it aright but in him. It is that which
   the whole light of the creation cannot discover; for it is the spring
   and centre of the mystery of godliness.
				</p><p>
   These things are of the deep things of God, such as belong unto that
   wisdom of God in a mystery which they that are carnal cannot receive,
   as the apostle testifies, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.14">1 Corinthians 2:14</reference> But the meanest believer who
   lives in the exercise of faith, may have an understanding of them so
   far as is needful unto his love and obedience. The sum of the whole is
   this: If you would behold the glory of Christ as the great means of
   your sanctification and consolation, as the only preparation for the
   beholding of his glory in eternal blessedness, consider what of God is
   made known and represented unto you in him, wherein God purposed and
   designed to glorify himself in him. Now, this is all that may be known
   of God in a saving manner, -- especially his wisdom, his love, his
   goodness, grace, and mercy, whereon the life of our souls does depend;
   -- and the Lord Christ being appointed the only way and means hereof,
   how exceeding glorious must he be in the eyes of them that do believe!
				</p><p>
   These things being premised, I shall close this first consideration of
   that glory of Christ which we behold by faith in this world, with some
   such observations as may excite us unto the practice of this great
   duty, and improvement of this great privilege, -- the greatest which on
   this side heaven we can be made partakers of.
				</p><p>
   There are some who regard not these things at all, but rather despise
   them. They never entertain any serious thoughts of obtaining a view of
   the glory of God in Christ, -- which is to be unbelievers. They look on
   him as a teacher that came forth from God to reveal his will, and to
   teach us his worship; and so indeed he was. But this they say was the
   sole use of his person in religion, -- which is Mohammedanism. The
   manifestation of all the holy properties of the divine nature, with the
   representation of them unto angels above and the church in this world,
   as he is the image of the invisible God, in the constitution of his
   person and the discharge of his office, are things they regard not;
   yea, they despise and scorn what is professed concerning them: for
   pride and contempt of others were always the safest covert of
   ignorance; otherwise it would seem strange that men should openly boast
   of their own blindness. But these conceptions of men's minds are
   influenced by that unbelief of his divine person which maketh havoc of
   Christianity at this day in the world.
				</p><p>
   I speak of them whose minds are better disposed towards heavenly
   things; and unto them I say, Wherefore do you love Jesus Christ? for so
   you profess to do. Wherefore do you trust in him? wherefore do you
   honour him? wherefore do you desire to be in heaven with him? Can you
   give a reason of this hope that is in you, -- an account why you do all
   or any of these things? If you cannot, all that you pretend towards him
   is but fancy and imagination; you fight uncertainly, as men beating the
   air. Or is one of your reasons hereof, that in him you do by faith
   behold that glory of God, with the holy properties of his nature, and
   their principal operations, in order unto your own salvation and
   blessedness, which otherwise would have been eternally hid from you?
   Herein is he "precious unto them that do believe."
				</p><p>
   Let us, therefore, as many as are spiritual, be thus minded. Let us
   make use of this privilege with rejoicing, and be found in the
   discharge of this duty with diligence. For thus to behold the glory of
   God is both our privilege and our duty. The duties of the Law were a
   burden and a yoke; but those of the Gospel are privileges and
   advantages.
				</p><p>
   It is a promise concerning the days of the New Testament, that our
   "eyes shall see the King in his beauty," <reference osisRef="Isa.33.17">Isaiah 33:17</reference> We shall
   behold the glory of Christ in its lustre and excellency. What is this
   beauty of the King of saints? Is it not that God is in him, and he is
   the great representative of his glory unto us? Wherefore, in the
   contemplation of this glory consists the principal exercise of faith.
   And who can declare the glory of this privilege, that we who are born
   in darkness, and deserved to be cast out into utter darkness, should be
   translated into this marvellous "light of the knowledge of the glory of
   God in the face of Jesus Christ?"
				</p><p>
   What are all the stained glories, the fading beauties of this world? of
   all that the devil showed our Saviour from the mount? what are they in
   comparison of one view of the glory of God represented in Christ, and
   of the glory of Christ as his great representative?
				</p><p>
   The most pernicious effect of unbelief under the preaching of the
   gospel is, that, together with an influence of power from Satan, "it
   blinds the eyes of men's minds, that they should not see this glory of
   Christ;" whereon they perish eternally, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.3 2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   But the most of those who at this day are called Christians are
   strangers unto this duty. Our Lord Jesus Christ told the Pharisees,
   that notwithstanding all their boasting of the knowledge of God, they
   had not "heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape;" that is, as
   Moses did. They had no real acquaintance with him, -- they had no
   spiritual view of his glory. And so it is amongst ourselves;
   notwithstanding the general profession that is of the knowledge of
   Christ, they are but few who thus behold his glory; and therefore few
   who are transformed into his image and likeness.
				</p><p>
   Some men speak much of the imitation of Christ, and following of his
   example; and it were well if we could see more of it really in effect.
   But no man shall ever become "like unto him" by bare imitation of his
   actions, without that view or intuition of his glory which alone is
   accompanied with a transforming power to change them into the same
   image.
				</p><p>
   The truth is, the best of us all are woefully defective in this duty,
   and many are discouraged from it because a pretence of it in some has
   degenerated into superstition; but we are loath at any time seriously
   to engage in it, and come with an unwilling kind of willingness unto
   the exercise of our minds in it.
				</p><p>
   Thoughts of this glory of Christ are too high for us, or too hard for
   us, such as we cannot long delight in; we turn away from them with a
   kind of weariness: yet are they of the same nature in general with our
   beholding of the glory of Christ in heaven, wherein there shall be no
   weariness, or satiety, unto eternity. Is not the cause of it, that we
   are unspiritual or carnal, having our thoughts and affections wonted to
   give entertainment unto other things? For this is the principal cause
   of our unreadiness and incapacity to exercise our minds in and about
   the great mysteries of the Gospel, <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.1 1Cor.3.2 1Cor.3.3">1 Corinthians 3:1-3</reference> And it is so with
   us, moreover, because we do not stir up ourselves with watchfulness and
   diligence in continual acting of faith on this blessed object. This is
   that which keeps many of us at so low an ebb, as unto the powers of a
   heavenly life and spiritual joys.
				</p><p>
   Did we abound in this duty, in this exercise of faith, our life in
   walking before God would be more sweet and pleasant unto us, -- our
   spiritual light and strength would have a daily increase, -- we should
   more represent the glory of Christ in our ways and walking than usually
   we do, and death itself would be most welcome unto us.
				</p><p>
   The angels themselves desire to look into the things of the glory of
   Christ, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference> There is in them matter of inquiry and
   instruction for the most high and holy spirits in heaven. The manifold
   wisdom of God in them is made known unto "principalities and powers in
   heavenly places by the church," <reference osisRef="Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:10</reference> And shall we neglect that
   which is the object of angelical diligence to inquire into; especially
   considering that we are more than they concerned in it?
				</p><p>
   Is Christ, then, thus glorious in our eyes? Do we see the Father in
   him, or by seeing of him? Do we sedulously daily contemplate on the
   wisdom, love, grace, goodness, holiness, and righteousness of God, as
   revealing and manifesting themselves in him? Do we sufficiently
   consider that the immediate vision of this glory in heaven will be our
   everlasting blessedness? Does the imperfect view which we have of it
   here increase our desires after the perfect sight of it above? With
   respect unto these inquiries I shall briefly speak unto sundry sorts of
   men.
				</p><p>
   Some will say they understand not these things, nor any concernment of
   their own in them. If they are true, yet are they notions which they
   may safely be without the knowledge of; for, so far as they can
   discern, they have no influence of Christian practice, or duties of
   morality; and the preaching of them does but take off the minds of men
   from more necessary duties. But "if the gospel be hid, it is hid unto
   them that perish." And unto the objection I say, --
				</p><p>
   1. Nothing is more fully and clearly revealed in the gospel, than that
   unto us Jesus Christ is "the image of the invisible God;" that he is
   the character of the person of the Father, so as that in seeing him we
   see the Father also; that we have "the light of the knowledge of the
   glory of God in his face alone," as has been proved. This is the
   principal fundamental mystery and truth of the Gospel; and which if it
   be not received, believed, owned, all other truths are useless unto our
   souls. To refer all the testimonies that are given hereunto to the
   doctrine which he taught, in contradistinction unto his person as
   acting in the discharge of his office, is anti-evangelical,
   anti-christian, -- turning the whole Gospel into a fable.
				</p><p>
   2. It is so, that the light of faith is given unto us principally to
   enable us to behold the glory of God in Christ, -- to contemplate on
   it, as unto all the ends of its manifestation. So is it expressly
   affirmed, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference> If we have not this light, as it is
   communicated by the power of God unto them that do believe, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.17 Eph.1.18 Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:17-19</reference>, we must be strangers unto the whole mystery of the gospel, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.3 2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   3. That in the beholding of the glory of God in Christ, we behold his
   glory also. For herein is he infinitely glorious above the whole
   creation, in that in and by him alone the glory of the invisible God is
   represented unto us. Herein do our souls live. This is that whereby the
   image of God is renewed in us, and we are made like unto the
   first-born.
				</p><p>
   4. This is so far from being unnecessary unto Christian practice, and
   the sanctified duties of morality, that he knows not Christ, he knows
   not the Gospel, he knows not the faith of the catholic church, who
   imagines that they can be performed acceptably without it. Yea, this is
   the root whence all other Christian duties do spring, and whereon their
   grow, whereby they are distinguished from the works of heathens. He is
   no Christian who believes not that faith in the person of Christ is the
   spring of all evangelical obedience; or who knows not that faith
   respects the revelation of the glory of God in him.
				</p><p>
   If these things are so, as they are the most important truths of the
   Gospel, and whose denial overthrows the foundation of faith, and is
   ruinous to Christian religion, certainly it is our duty to live in the
   constant exercise of faith with respect unto this glory of Christ. And
   we have sufficient experience of what kind of morality the ignorance of
   it has produced.
				</p><p>
   Others there are who may be some way strangers, but are no way enemies,
   unto this mystery, and to the practical exercise of faith therein. To
   such I shall tender the ensuing directions: 
				</p><p>
   1. Reckon in your minds, that this beholding of the glory of Christ by
   beholding the glory of God, and all his holy properties in him, is the
   greatest privilege whereof in this life we can be made partakers. The
   dawning of heaven is in it, and the first-fruits of glory; for this is
   life eternal, to know the Father, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent,
   <reference osisRef="John.17.3">John 17:3</reference> Unless you value it, unless you esteem it as such a
   privilege, you will not enjoy it; and that which is not valued
   according unto its worth is despised. It is not enough to think it a
   privilege, an advantage; but it is to be valued above other things,
   according unto its greatness and excellency. "Destruction and death
   say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears," <reference osisRef="Job.28.22">Job 28:22</reference> And
   if we do no more, we shall die strangers unto it; we are to "cry after
   this knowledge, and lift up our voice for this understanding," if we
   design to attain it.
				</p><p>
   2. As it is a great privilege, which requires a due valuation; so it is
   a great mystery, which requires much spiritual wisdom to the right
   understanding of it, and to direct in its practice, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.4 1Cor.2.5">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</reference>
   Flesh and blood will not reveal it unto us, but we must be taught of
   God to apprehend it, <reference osisRef="John.1.12 John.1.13">John 1:12-13</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.16.16 Matt.16.17">Matthew 16:16-17</reference> Mere
   unsanctified reason will never enable us unto, nor guide us in, the
   discovery of this duty. Men are not so vain as to hope for skill and
   understanding in the mystery of a secular art or trade, without the
   diligent use of those means whereby it may be attained; and shall we
   suppose that we may be furnished with spiritual skill and wisdom in
   this sacred mystery, without diligence in the use of the means
   appointed of God for the attaining of it? The principal of them is
   fervent prayer. Pray, then, with Moses, that God would show you this
   his glory; pray with the apostle, that "the eyes of your understanding
   may be enlightened to behold it;" pray that the "God of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
   revelation in the knowledge of him." Fill your minds with spiritual
   thoughts and contrivances about them. Slothful and lazy souls never
   obtain one view of this glory; the "lion in the way" deters them from
   attempting it. Being carnal, they abhor all diligence in the use of
   spiritual means, such as prayer and meditation on things unto them
   uneasy, unpleasing, and difficult. Unto others the way partakes of the
   nature of the end; the means of obtaining a view of the glory of Christ
   are of the same kind, of the same pleasantness, with that view itself
   in their proportion.
				</p><p>
   3. Learn the use hereof from the acting of contrary vicious habits.
   When the minds of men are vehemently fixed on the pursuit of their
   lusts, they will be continually ruminating on the objects of them, and
   have a thousand contrivances about them, until their "eyes become full
   of adulteries, and they cannot cease from sinning," as the apostle
   speaks. The objects of their lusts have framed and raised an image of
   themselves in their minds, and transformed them into their own
   likeness. Is this the way of them who "go down to the chambers of
   death?" Do they thus frame their souls, and make them meet for
   destruction, until their words, gestures, actions, proclaim the frame
   of their minds unto all that look upon them? And shall we be slothful
   and negligent in the contemplation of that glory which transforms our
   minds into its own likeness, so as that the eyes of our understandings
   shall be continually filled with it, until we see him and behold him
   continually, so as never to cease from the holy acts of delight in him
   and love to him?
				</p><p>
   4. Would we, then, behold the glory of God as he manifesteth it in and
   by the holy properties of his nature, with their blessed operations and
   effects? -- without which we have nothing of the power of religion in
   us, whatever we pretend: this alone is the way of it. Go to the whole
   creation, and all things contained in it; they can say no more, but,
   "We have heard the fame and report of these things," and what we have
   heard we declare; but it is but a little portion of them that we are
   acquainted withal. "The heavens," indeed, "declare the glory of God,
   and the firmament showeth his handy-work." "The invisible things of God
   are understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
   Godhead." But, comparatively, it is but little that we can hence learn
   of these things, as to that we may behold of them in Christ Jesus. How
   blind herein was the best philosopher in comparison of the meanest of
   the apostles; yea, of him who is least in the kingdom of heaven!
				</p><p>
   But herein it is required that we rest not in the notion of this truth,
   and a bare assent unto the doctrine of it. The affecting power of it
   upon our hearts is that which we should aim at. Wherein does the
   blessedness of the saints above consist? Is it not herein, that they
   behold and see the glory of God in Christ? And what is the effect of it
   upon those blessed souls? Does it not change them into the same image,
   or make them like unto Christ? Does it not fill and satiate them with
   joy, rest, delight, complacency, and ineffable satisfaction? Do we
   expect, do we desire, the same state of blessedness? It is our present
   view of the glory of Christ which is our initiation thereinto, if we
   are exercised in it, until we have an experience of its transforming
   power in our souls.
				</p><p>
   These things are, it may be, of little use unto some. Such as are babes
   in spiritual knowledge and understanding, -- either because they are
   carnal, <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.1 1Cor.3.2">1 Corinthians 3:1-2</reference>, or slothful in hearing, <reference osisRef="Heb.5.12 Heb.5.13 Heb.5.14">Hebrews 5:12-14</reference>, -- are
   not capable of these divine mysteries. And therefore the apostle did,
   in an especial manner, declare this wisdom of God in a mystery unto
   them that were perfect, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.6 1Cor.2.7">1 Corinthians 2:6-7</reference>; -- that is, who were more
   grown in spiritual knowledge, and had their "senses exercised to
   discern good and evil." It is unto them who are exercised in the
   contemplation of invisible things, who delight to walk in the more
   retired paths of faith and love, that they are precious.
				</p><p>
   Some few inferences from the whole of what has been declared shall put
   a close to this part of our Discourse.
				</p><p>
   1. The holy properties of the divine nature are not only represented
   unto our faith in Christ, as to their own essential glory, but as they
   are in the exercise of their powers for the salvation of the church. In
   him do we behold the wisdom, goodness, love, grace, mercy, and power of
   God, acting themselves in the contrivance, constitution, and
   efficacious accomplishment of the great work of our redemption and
   salvation. This gives, as unto us, an unutterable lustre unto the
   native amiableness of the divine excellencies. The wisdom and love of
   God are in themselves infinitely glorious, -- infinitely amiable; --
   nothing can be added unto them, -- there can be no increase of their
   essential glory. Howbeit, as they are eternally resident in the divine
   nature, and absolutely the same with it, we cannot so comprehend them
   as to have an endearing, satiating view of their glory, but as they are
   exerted in the work of the redemption and salvation of the church, --
   as they are expressed, communicating their blessed effects unto the
   souls of them that do believe, -- which is done only in Christ; so the
   beams of their glory shine unto us with unspeakable refreshment and
   joy, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference> Hence the apostle, on the consideration of the
   acting of the holy properties of God in this blessed work, falls into
   that contemplation, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
   knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
   finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been
   his counsellor? or who hath first given to him, and it shall be
   recompensed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him,
   are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen," <reference osisRef="Rom.11.33 Rom.11.34 Rom.11.35 Rom.11.36">Romans 11:33-36</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. In and through Christ we do believe in God, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.21">1 Peter 1:21</reference> This is
   the life of our souls. God himself, in the infinite perfections of his
   divine nature, is the ultimate object of our faith. But he is not here
   the immediate object of it; but the divine way and means of the
   manifestation of himself and them unto us, are so. Through Christ we
   believe in God. By our belief in him we come to place our faith
   ultimately in God himself; and this we can no otherwise do but by
   beholding the glory of God in him, as has been declared.
				</p><p>
   3. This is the only way whereby we may attain the saving, sanctifying
   knowledge of God. Without this, every beam of divine light that shines
   on us, or gleams from without (as the light shineth into darkness when
   the darkness comprehendeth it not, <reference osisRef="John.1.5">John 1:5</reference>), every spark that ariseth
   from the remainders of the light of nature within, does rather amaze
   the minds of men than lead them into the saving knowledge of God. So a
   glance of light in a dark night, giving a transient view of various
   objects, and passing away, does rather amaze than direct a traveller,
   and leave him more exposed unto wandering than before. Such were all
   those notions of the Divine Being and his excellencies, which those who
   boasted themselves to be wise among the heathen embraced and improved.
   They did but fluctuate in their minds; they did not transform them into
   the image and likeness of God, as the saving knowledge of him does,
   <reference osisRef="Col.3.10">Colossians 3:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   So the apostle expresseth this truth, "Where is the wise? where is the
   scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish
   the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God, the
   world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of
   preaching to save them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and
   the Greeks seek after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, unto the
   Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them
   which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and
   the wisdom of God," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.20 1Cor.1.21 1Cor.1.22 1Cor.1.23 1Cor.1.24">1 Corinthians 1:20-24</reference>
				</p><p>
   After it was evident unto all, that the world, the wise, the studious,
   the contemplative part of it, in the wisdom of God, disposing them into
   that condition wherein they were left unto themselves, in their own
   wisdom, their natural light and reason, did not, could not, come to the
   saving knowledge of God, but were puffed up into a contempt of the only
   way of the revelation of himself as weakness and folly; -- it pleased
   God then to manifest all their wisdom to be folly, and to establish the
   only means of the knowledge of himself in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 3 The glory of Christ in the mysterious constitution of his person">
<title>Chapter 3 The glory of Christ in the mysterious constitution of his person</title>
<p>   The second thing wherein we may behold the glory of Christ, given him
   of his Father, is in the mysterious constitution of his Person, as he
   is God and man in one and the same person. There are in him, in his one
   single individual person, two distinct natures; the one, eternal,
   infinite, immense, almighty, -- the form and essence of God; the other,
   having a beginning in time, finite, limited, confined unto a certain
   place, -- which is our nature, which he took on him when he was "made
   flesh, and dwelt among us." The declaration of the nature of this glory
   is a part of my discourse of the Person of Christ, whereunto I refer
   the reader:  my present design is of another nature.
				</p><p>
   This is that glory whose beams are so illustrious, as that the blind
   world cannot bear the light and beauty of them. Multitudes begin openly
   to deny this incarnation of the Son of God, -- this personal union of
   God and man in their distinct natures. They deny that there is either
   glory or truth in it; and it will ere long appear (it begins already to
   evidence itself) what greater multitudes there are, who yet do not, who
   yet dare not, openly reject the doctrine of it, who in truth believe it
   not, nor see any glory in it. Howbeit, this glory is the glory of our
   religion, -- the glory of the church, -- the sole Rock whereon it is
   built, -- the only spring of present grace and future glory.
				</p><p>
   This is that glory which the angels themselves desire to behold, the
   mystery whereof they "bow down to look into," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference> So was
   their desire represented by the cherubim in the most holy place of the
   tabernacle; for they were a shadow of the ministry of angels in the
   church. The ark and the mercy seat were a type of Christ in the
   discharge of his office; and these cherubim were made standing over
   them, as being in heaven above; but earnestly looking down upon them in
   a posture of reverence and adoration. So they did of old; and in their
   present contemplation of it consists no small part of their eternal
   blessedness.
				</p><p>
   Hereon depends the ruin of Satan and his kingdom. His sin, so far as we
   can conceive, consisted of two parts. 1. His pride against the person
   of the Son of God, by whom he was created. "For by him were all things
   created that are" (or were when first created) "in heaven, whether they
   be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or power," <reference osisRef="Col.1.16">Colossians 1:16</reference>
   Against him he lifted up himself; -- which was the beginning of his
   transgression. 2. Envy against mankind, made in the image of God, of
   the Son of God the first born. This completed his sin; nothing was now
   left whereon to act his pride and malice. Unto his eternal confusion
   and ruin, God, in infinite wisdom, unites both the natures he had
   sinned against in the one person of the Son; who was the first object
   of his pride and malice. Hereby his destruction is attended with
   everlasting shame in the discovery of his folly, wherein he would have
   contended with infinite wisdom, as well as misery, by the powers of the
   two natures united in one person.
				</p><p>
   Here lies the foundation of the church. The foundation of the whole old
   creation was laid in an act of absolute sovereign power. Hereby God
   "hanged the earth upon nothing." But the foundation of the church is on
   this mysterious, immovable rock, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
   living God;" -- on the most intimate conjunction of the two natures,
   the divine and human, in themselves infinitely distant, in the same
   person.
				</p><p>
   We may name one place wherein it is gloriously represented unto us,
   <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and
   the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
   Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
   Prince of Peace." Here must the whole church fall down and worship the
   Author of this wonderful contrivance; and, captivating their
   understandings unto the obedience of faith, humbly adore what they
   cannot comprehend.
				</p><p>
   This was obscurely represented unto the church of old, <reference osisRef="Exod.3.2 Exod.3.3 Exod.3.4 Exod.3.5 Exod.3.6">Exodus 3:2-6</reference>,
   "And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of
   the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
   fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn
   aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when
   the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of
   the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
   And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet;
   for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I
   am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham," etc..
				</p><p>
   This fire was a type or declaration of the presence of God in the
   person of the Son. For with respect unto the Father he is called an
   Angel, the Angel of the covenant; but absolutely in himself, he was
   Jehovah, the "God of Abraham," etc.. And of his presence the fire was a
   proper representation. For in his nature he is as a "consuming fire;"
   and his present work was the delivery of the church out of a fiery
   trial. This fire placed itself in a bush, where it burned; but the bush
   was not consumed. And although the continuance of the fire in the bush
   was but for a short season, a present appearance, yet thence was God
   said to dwell in the bush: "The good-will of him that dwelt in the
   bush," <reference osisRef="Deut.33.16">Deuteronomy 33:16</reference> And this is so spoken, because the being of
   the fire in the bush for a season was a type of him in whom "the
   fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily," and that for ever, <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference>, --
   of him who was "made flesh, and dwelt among us," <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference> The
   eternal fire of the divine nature dwells in the bush of our frail
   nature, yet is it not consumed thereby. God thus dwells in this bush,
   with all his good-will towards sinners.
				</p><p>
   Moses looked on this sight as a marvellous and wondrous thing. And if
   it were so in the type, what is it in the truth, substance, and reality
   of it?
				</p><p>
   And by direction given unto him to "put off his shoes," we are taught
   to cast away all fleshly imaginations and carnal affections, that by
   pure acts of faith we may behold this glory, -- the glory of the
   only-begotten of the Father.
				</p><p>
   I design not here to insist on the explication or confirmation of this
   glorious truth, concerning the constitution of the person of Christ in
   and by his incarnation. What I can comprehend, what I do believe
   concerning it, I have fully declared in a large peculiar treatise. [2]
   Here I take the truth itself as known, or as it may be thence learned.
   My present business is only to stir up the minds of believers unto a
   due contemplation of the glory of Christ in the sacred, mysterious
   constitution of his person, as God and man in one. So much as we abide
   herein, so much do "we live by the faith of the Son of God;" -- and God
   can, by a spirit of wisdom and revelation, open the eyes of our
   understandings, that we may behold this glory unto our ineffable
   consolation and joy. And unto the diligent discharge of our duty herein
   I shall offer the ensuing directions: 
				</p><p>
   1. Let us get it fixed on our souls and in our minds, that this glory
   of Christ in the divine constitution of his person is the best, the
   most noble, useful, beneficial object that we can be conversant about
   in our thoughts, or cleave unto in our affections.
				</p><p>
   What are all other things in comparison of the "knowledge of Christ?"
   In the judgment of the great apostle, they are but "loss and dung,"
   <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8 Phil.3.9 Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:8-10</reference> So they were to him; and if they are not so to us we
   are carnal.
				</p><p>
   What is the world, and what are the things thereof, which most men
   spend their thoughts about, and fix their affections on? The Psalmist
   gives his judgment about them, in comparison of a view of this glory of
   Christ, <reference osisRef="Ps.4.6">Psalms 4:6</reference>, "Many say, Who will show us any good?" -- Who will
   give and help us to attain so much in and of this world as will give
   rest and satisfaction unto our minds? That is the good inquired after.
   But, saith he, "Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
   us." The light of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus is that
   satisfactory good alone which I desire and seek after.
				</p><p>
   The Scripture reproacheth the vanity and folly of the minds of men, in
   that "they spend their money for that which is not bread, and their
   labour for that which profiteth not." They engage the vigour of their
   spirits about perishing things, when they have durable substance and
   riches proposed unto them.
				</p><p>
   How do men for the most part exercise their minds? what are they
   conversant about in their thoughts?
				</p><p>
   Some by them "make provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
   thereof;" as <reference osisRef="Rom.13.14">Romans 13:14</reference> They search about continually in their
   thoughts for objects suited unto their lusts and carnal affections,
   coining, framing, and stamping of them in their imaginations. They fix
   their eyes with delight on toads and serpents, with all noisome, filthy
   objects, -- refusing, in the meantime, to behold the beauty and glory
   of the light of the sun. So is it with all that spend their thoughts
   about the objects of their sinful pleasures, -- refusing to look up
   after one view of this glory of Christ.
				</p><p>
   Some keep their thoughts in continual exercise about the things of this
   world, as unto the advantages and emoluments which they expect from
   them. Hereby are they transformed into the image of the world, becoming
   earthly, carnal, and vain. Is it because there is no God in Israel that
   these applications are made unto the idol of Ekron? That there is no
   glory, no desirableness in Christ for men to inquire after, and fix
   their minds upon? O the blindness, the darkness, the folly of poor
   sinners! Whom do they despise? and for what?
				</p><p>
   Some, of more refined parts and notional minds, do arise unto a
   sedulous meditation on the works of creation and providence. Hence many
   excellent discourses on that subject, adorned with eloquence, are
   published among us. And a work this is worthy of our nature, and suited
   unto our rational capacities; yea, the first end of our natural
   endowment with them. But in all these things, there is no glory in
   comparison of what is proposed to us in the mysterious constitution of
   the person of Christ. The sun has no glory, the moon and stars no
   beauty, the order and influence of the heavenly bodies have no
   excellency, in comparison of it.
				</p><p>
   This is that which the Psalmist designs to declare, Ps. viii., "O Lord
   our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy
   glory above the heavens. When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy
   fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man,
   that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest
   him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast
   crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion
   over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet."
				</p><p>
   He is engaged in a contemplation of the glory of God in his works; and
   he concludes that the fabric of heaven, with the moon and stars therein
   (for it was his meditation by night, when he beheld them), was
   exceeding glorious, and greatly to be admired. This casts his thoughts
   on the poor, weak, infirm nature of man, which seems as nothing in
   comparison of those glories above; but immediately hereon he falls into
   an admiration of the wisdom, goodness, and love of God, exalting that
   nature incomparably above all the works of creation in the person of
   Jesus Christ; as the apostle expounds in this place, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.5 Heb.2.6">Hebrews 2:5-6</reference>
				</p><p>
   This, therefore, is the highest, the best, the most useful object of
   our thoughts and affections. He who has had a real view of this glory,
   though he know himself to be a poor, sinful, dying worm of the earth,
   yet would he not be an angel in heaven, if thereby he should lose the
   sight of it; for this is the centre wherein all the lines of the
   manifestation of the divine glory do meet and rest.
				</p><p>
   Look unto the things of this world, -- wives, children, possessions,
   estates, power, friends, and honour; how amiable are they! how
   desirable unto the thoughts of the most of men! But he who has obtained
   a view of the glory of Christ, will, in the midst of them all, say,
   "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none on earth that I
   desire besides thee," <reference osisRef="Ps.73.25">Psalms 73:25</reference>; "For who in the heaven can be
   compared unto the Lord? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened
   unto the Lord?" <reference osisRef="Ps.89.6">Psalms 89:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   He himself, out of his infinite love and ineffable condescension, upon
   the sight and view of his church, and his own graces in her, wherewith
   she is adorned, does say, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my
   spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one
   chain of thy neck," <reference osisRef="Song.4.9">Song of Solomon 4:9</reference> How much more ought a believing soul,
   upon a view of the glory of Christ, in whom it pleased the Father that
   all fulness should dwell, to say, Thou hast ravished my heart, taken it
   away from me! "O thou whom my soul loveth," one glance of thy glorious
   beauty upon me has quite overcome me, -- hath left no heart in me unto
   things here below! If it be not thus with us frequently, -- if we value
   not this object of our minds and affections, -- if we are not diligent
   in looking up unto him to behold his glory, -- it is because we are
   carnal, and not in any good measure partakers of the promise, that "our
   eyes shall see the King in his beauty."
				</p><p>
   2. Our second direction unto the same end is, that we diligently study
   the Scripture, and the revelations that are made of this glory of
   Christ therein. To behold it, is not a work of fancy or imagination; it
   is not conversing with an image framed by the art of men without, or
   that of our own fancy within, but of faith exercised on divine
   revelations. This direction he gives us himself, <reference osisRef="John.5.39">John 5:39</reference>, "Search
   the Scriptures; for they are they which testify of me." The way whereby
   this is done is fully set before us in the example of the holy prophets
   under the Old Testament, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11 1Pet.1.12 1Pet.1.13">1 Peter 1:11-13</reference>
				</p><p>
   This principle is always to be retained in our minds in reading of the
   Scripture, -- namely, that the revelation and doctrine of the person of
   Christ and his office, is the foundation whereon all other instructions
   of the prophets and apostles for the edification of the church are
   built, and whereinto they are resolved; as is declared, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.20 Eph.2.21 Eph.2.22">Ephesians 2:20-22</reference>
   So our Lord Jesus Christ himself at large makes it manifest, <reference osisRef="Luke.24.26 Luke.24.27 Luke.24.45 Luke.24.46">Luke 24:26-27, 45-46</reference> Lay aside the consideration hereof, and the Scriptures
   are no such thing as they pretend unto, -- namely, a revelation of the
   glory of God in the salvation of the church; nor are those of the Old
   Testament so at this day unto the Jews, who own not this principle, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.13 2Cor.3.14 2Cor.3.15 2Cor.3.16">2 Corinthians 3:13-16</reference> There are, therefore, such revelations of the person
   and glory of Christ treasured up in the Scripture, from the beginning
   unto the end of it, as may exercise the faith and contemplation of
   believers in this world, and shall never, during this life, be fully
   discovered or understood; and in divine meditations of these
   revelations does much of the life of faith consist.
				</p><p>
   There are three ways whereby the glory of Christ is represented unto us
   in the Scripture. First, By direct descriptions of his glorious person
   and incarnation. See, among other places, <reference osisRef="Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.2.7 Ps.2.8 Ps.2.9">Psalms 2:7-9</reference>,
   xlv. 2-6, lxviii. 17, 18, cx.; <reference osisRef="Isa.6.1 Isa.6.2 Isa.6.3 Isa.6.4">Isaiah 6:1-4</reference>, ix. 6; <reference osisRef="Zech.3.8">Zechariah 3:8</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.1.1 John.1.2 John.1.3">John 1:1-3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:6-8</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.1 Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:1-3</reference>, ii. 14-16; <reference osisRef="Rev.1.17 Rev.1.18">Revelation of John 1:17-18</reference>
   Secondly, By prophecies, promises, and express instructions concerning
   him, all leading unto the contemplation of his glory, which are
   innumerable. Thirdly, By the sacred institutions of divine worship
   under the Old Testament: for the end of them all was to represent unto
   the church the glory of Christ in the discharge of his office; as we
   shall see afterward.
				</p><p>
   We may take notice of an instance in one kind under the Old Testament,
   and of one and another under the New.
				</p><p>
   His personal appearances under the Old Testament carried in them a
   demonstration of his glory. Such was that in the vision which Isaiah
   had, "when he saw his glory, and spake of him," chap. vi. 1, 2, "I saw
   the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train
   filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphim," etc.. It was a
   representation of the glory of the divine presence of Christ filling
   his human nature, the temple of his body, with a train of all-glorious
   graces. And if this typical representation of it was so glorious, as
   that the seraphim were not able steadfastly to behold it, but "covered
   their faces" upon its appearance, verse 2, how exceeding glorious is it
   in itself, as it is openly revealed in the Gospel!
				</p><p>
   Of the same nature are the immediate testimonies given unto him from
   heaven in the New Testament. So the apostle tells us, "he received from
   God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him
   from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased," <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.17">2 Peter 1:17</reference> The apostle intends the time of his
   transfiguration in the mount; for so he adds, verse 18, "And this voice
   which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy
   mount." Howbeit, at sundry other times he had the same testimony, or to
   the same purpose, from God, even the Father, in heaven. Herein God gave
   him honour and glory, which all those that believe in him should behold
   and admire; not only those who heard this testimony with their bodily
   ears, but all unto whom it is testified in the Scripture, are obliged
   to look after, and contemplate on, the glory of Christ, as thus
   revealed and proposed. From the throne of his excellency, by audible
   voices, by visible signs, by the opening of the heavens above, by the
   descent of the Holy Spirit upon him, God testified unto him as his
   eternal Son, and gave him therein honour and glory. The thoughts of
   this divine testimony, and the glory of Christ therein, has often
   filled the hearts of some with joy and delight.
				</p><p>
   This, therefore, in reading and studying the holy Scripture, we ought
   with all diligence to search and attend unto, as did the prophets of
   old (<reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11 1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:11-12</reference>), if we intend by them to be made "wise unto
   salvation."
				</p><p>
   We should herein be as the merchant-man that seeks for pearls; he seeks
   for all sorts of them, but when he has found one of "great price," he
   parts with all to make it his own, <reference osisRef="Matt.13.45 Matt.13.46">Matthew 13:45-46</reference> The Scripture is
   the field, the place, the mine where we search and dig for pearls. See
   <reference osisRef="Prov.2.1 Prov.2.2 Prov.2.3 Prov.2.4 Prov.2.5">Proverbs 2:1-5</reference> Every sacred truth that is made effectual unto the good
   of our souls, is a pearl whereby we are enriched; but when we meet
   with, when we fall upon this pearl of great price, the glory of Christ,
   -- this is that which the soul of a believer cleaves unto with joy.
				</p><p>
   Then do we find food for souls in the word of truth, then do we taste
   how gracious the Lord is therein, then is the Scripture full of
   refreshment unto us as a spring of living water, -- when we are taken
   into blessed views of the glory of Christ therein. And we are in the
   best frame of duty, when the principal motive in our minds to contend
   earnestly for retaining the possession of the Scripture against all
   that would deprive us of it, or discourage us from a daily diligent
   search into it, is this, -- that they would take from us the only glass
   wherein we may behold the glory of Christ. This is the glory of the
   Scripture, that it is the great, yea, the only, outward means of
   representing unto us the glory of Christ; and he is the sun in the
   firmament of it, which only has light in itself, and communicates it
   unto all other things besides.
				</p><p>
   3. Another direction unto this same end is, that having attained the
   light of the knowledge of the glory of Christ from the Scripture, or by
   the dispensation of the truth in the preaching of the gospel, we would
   esteem it our duty frequently to meditate thereon.
				</p><p>
   Want hereof is that fundamental mistake which keeps many among us so
   low in their grace, so regardless of their privileges. They hear of
   these things, they assent unto their truth, at least they do not
   gainsay them; but they never solemnly meditate upon them. This they
   esteem a world that is above them, or are ignorant totally of it, or
   esteem themselves not much concerned in it, or dislike it as
   fanaticism. For it is that which no considerations can engage a carnal
   mind to delight in. The mind must be spiritual and holy, freed from
   earthly affections and encumbrances, raised above things here below,
   that can in a due manner meditate on the glory of Christ. Therefore are
   the most strangers unto this duty, because they will not be at the
   trouble and charge of that mortification of earthly affections, -- that
   extirpation of sensual inclinations, -- that retirement from the
   occasions of life, which are required whereunto. See the treatise on
   Spiritual-mindedness.
				</p><p>
   It is to be feared that there are some who profess religion with an
   appearance of strictness, who never separate themselves from all other
   occasions, to meditate on Christ and his glory; and yet, with a strange
   inconsistency of apprehensions, they will profess that they desire
   nothing more than to behold his glory in heaven for ever. But it is
   evident, even in the light of reason, that these things are
   irreconcilable. It is impossible that he who never meditates with
   delight on the glory of Christ here in this world, who labours not to
   behold it by faith as it is revealed in the Scripture, should ever have
   any real gracious desire to behold it in heaven. They may love and
   desire the fruition of their own imaginations; -- they cannot do so of
   the glory of Christ, whereof they are ignorant, and wherewith they are
   unacquainted. It is, therefore, to be lamented that men can find time
   for, and have inclinations to think and meditate on, other things, that
   may be earthly and vain; but have neither heart, nor inclination, nor
   leisure, to meditate on this glorious object. What is the faith and
   love which such men profess? How will they find themselves deceived in
   the issue!
				</p><p>
   4. Let your occasional thoughts of Christ be many, and multiplied every
   day. He is not far from us; we may make a speedy address unto him at
   any time. So the apostle informs us, <reference osisRef="Rom.10.6 Rom.10.7 Rom.10.8">Romans 10:6-8</reference>, "Say not in thine
   heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down
   from above;) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
   Christ again from the dead.)" For "the word is nigh thee, even in thy
   mouth, and in thy heart." The things that Christ did were done at a
   distance from us, and they are long since past. But, saith the apostle,
   "The word" of the Gospel wherein these things are revealed, and whereby
   an application is made of them unto our souls, is nigh unto us, even in
   our hearts; that is, if we are true believers, and have mixed the word
   with faith, -- and so it exhibiteth Christ and all the benefits of his
   mediation unto us. If, therefore, this word is in our hearts, Christ is
   nigh unto us. If we turn at any time into ourselves to converse with
   the word that abideth in us, there we shall find him ready to receive
   us into communion with himself; that is, in the light of the knowledge
   of Christ which we have by the word, we may have sudden, occasional
   thoughts of him continually: and where our minds and affections are so
   filled with other things that we are not ready for converse with him
   who is thus nigh unto us by the word, we are spiritually indisposed.
				</p><p>
   So, to manifest how nigh he is unto us, it is said that "he stands at
   the door, and knocks," <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference>, in the continual tender that he
   makes of himself and his grace unto our souls. For he is always
   accompanied with the glorious train of his graces; and if they are not
   received, he himself is not so. It is to no purpose to boast of Christ,
   if we have not an evidence of his graces in our hearts and lives. But
   unto whom he is the hope of future glory, unto them he is the life of
   present grace.
				</p><p>
   Sometimes it may be that He is withdrawn from us, so as that we cannot
   hear his voice, nor behold his countenance, nor obtain any sense of his
   love, though we seek him with diligence. In this state, all our
   thoughts and meditations concerning him will be barren and fruitless,
   bringing in no spiritual refreshment into our souls. And if we learn to
   be content with such lifeless, unaffecting thoughts of him as bring in
   no experience of his love, nor give us a real view of the glory of his
   person, we shall wither away as unto all the power of religion.
				</p><p>
   What is our duty in this case is so fully expressed by the spouse in
   the Canticles, as represents it plainly unto the minds of believers,
   who have any experience of these things, chap. iii. 1-4, "By night on
   my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him
   not. I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the
   broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I
   found him not. The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I
   said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? It was but a little that I passed
   from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would
   not let him go." The like account she gives of herself, and of her
   behaviour on the like occasion, chap. v. 2-8.
				</p><p>
   This is the substance of what by this example we are instructed unto.
   The Lord Christ is pleased sometimes to withdraw himself from the
   spiritual experience of believers; as to any refreshing sense of his
   love, or the fresh communications of consolatory graces. Those who
   never had experience of any such thing, who never had any refreshing
   communion with him, cannot be sensible of his absence; -- they never
   were so of his presence. But those whom he has visited, -- to whom he
   has given of his loves, -- with whom he has made his abode, -- whom he
   has refreshed, relieved, and comforted, -- in whom he has lived in the
   power of his grace, -- they know what it is to be forsaken by him,
   though but for a moment. And their trouble is increased, when they seek
   him with diligence in the wonted ways of obtaining his presence, and
   cannot find him. Our duty, in this case, is to persevere in our
   inquiries after him, in prayer, meditation, mourning, reading and
   hearing of the Word, in all ordinances of divine worship, private and
   public, in diligent obedience, -- until we find him, or he return unto
   us, as in former days.
				</p><p>
   It were well if all churches and professors now would manifest the same
   diligence herein as did the church of old in this example. Many of
   them, if they are not hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, cannot but
   be sensible that the Lord Christ is variously withdrawn from them, if
   ever they had experience of the power of his presence. Yet are the
   generality of them far from the frame of heart here described in the
   spouse; for they are slothful, careless, negligent, and stir not up
   themselves to inquire after him, or his return unto their souls. So was
   it with Laodicea of old, so was it with Sardis, and so it is to be
   feared that it is with many at present. But to return.
				</p><p>
   Generally, Christ is nigh unto believers, and of a ready access; and
   the principal actings of the life of faith consist in the frequency of
   our thoughts concerning him; for hereby Christ liveth in us, as he is
   said to do, <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference> This we cannot do, unless we have frequent
   thoughts of him and converse with him. It is often said among men, that
   one lives in another; this cannot be but where the affections of one
   are so engaged unto another, that night and day he thinks of him, and
   is thereby, as it were, present with him. So ought it to be between
   Christ and believers. He dwells in them by faith; but the actings of
   this life in them (as wherever life is, it will be in act and exercise)
   are proportionable unto their thoughts of him, and delight in him.
				</p><p>
   If, therefore, we would behold the glory of Christ, the present
   direction is, that on all occasions, and frequently when there are no
   occasions for it by the performance of other duties, we would abound in
   thoughts of him and his glory. I intend not at present fixed and stated
   meditations, which were spoken unto before; but such thoughts as are
   more transient, according as our opportunities are. And a great rebuke
   it ought to be unto us, when Christ has at any time in a day been long
   out of our minds. The spouse affirms that, ere she was aware, her soul
   made her as the chariots of Ammi-nadib, <reference osisRef="Song.6.12">Song of Solomon 6:12</reference> It so fell out,
   that when she had no thoughts, no design or purpose, for attendance on
   communion with Christ, that she was surprised into a readiness and
   willingness unto it. So it will be with them that love him in
   sincerity. Their own souls, without previous designs or outward
   occasions, will frequently engage them in holy thoughts of him; which
   is the most eminent character of a truly spiritual Christian.
				</p><p>
   5. The next direction is, that all our thoughts concerning Christ and
   his glory should be accompanied with admiration, adoration, and
   thanksgiving. For this is such an object of our thoughts and affections
   as, in this life, we can never fully comprehend, -- an ocean whose
   depths we cannot look into. If we are spiritually renewed, all the
   faculties of our souls are enabled by grace to exert their respective
   powers towards this glorious object. This must be done in various
   duties, by the exercise of various graces, as they are to be acted by
   the distinct powers of the faculties of our minds. This is that which
   is intended where we are commanded "to love the Lord with all our
   souls, with all our minds, with all our strength." All the distinct
   powers of our souls are to be acted by distinct graces and duties in
   cleaving unto God by love. In heaven, when we are come to our centre,
   that state of rest and blessedness which our nature is ultimately
   capable of, nothing but one infinite, invariable object of our minds
   and affections, received by vision, can render that state uninterrupted
   and unchangeable. But whilst we are here we know or see but in part,
   and we must also act our faith and love on part of that glory, which is
   not at once entirely proposed unto us, and which as yet we cannot
   comprehend. Wherefore we must act various graces in great variety about
   it; -- some at one time, some at another, according unto the powers of
   all our renewed faculties. Of this sort are those mentioned of
   adoration, admiration, and thanksgiving; which are those acts of our
   minds wherein all others do issue when the object is incomprehensible.
   For unto them we are enabled by grace.
				</p><p>
   One end of his illustrious coming unto the judgment of the last day is,
   that he may be "admired in all them that believe," <reference osisRef="2Thess.1.10">2 Thessalonians 1:10</reference> Even
   believers themselves shall be filled with an overwhelming admiration
   upon his glorious appearance. Or if the meaning be, not that he shall
   be admired by them, but admired in them, because of the mighty works of
   his grace and power in their redemption, sanctification, resurrection,
   and glory, it is to the same purpose, -- he "comes to be admired." And,
   according to the prospect which we have of that glory ought our
   admiration to be.
				</p><p>
   And this admiration will issue in adoration and thanksgiving; whereof
   we have an eminent instance and example in the whole church of the
   redeemed, <reference osisRef="Rev.5.9 Rev.5.10 Rev.5.11 Rev.5.12 Rev.5.13 Rev.5.14">Revelation of John 5:9-14</reference>, "They sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy
   to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain,
   and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and
   tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and
   priests: and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld, and I heard the
   voice of many angels round about the throne, and of the living
   creatures, and of the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand
   times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud
   voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches,
   and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And
   every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the
   earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I
   saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that
   sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever."
				</p><p>
   The design of this Discourse is no more, but that when by faith we have
   attained a view of the glory of Christ, in our contemplations on his
   person, we should not pass it over as a notion of truth which we assent
   unto, -- namely, that he is thus glorious in himself, -- but endeavour
   to affect our hearts with it, as that wherein our own principal
   interest does lie; wherein it will be effectual unto the transformation
   of our souls into his image.
				</p><p>
   But some, it may be, will say, at least I fear some may truly say, that
   these things do not belong unto them; they do not find that ever they
   had any benefit by them: they hope to be saved as well as others by the
   mediation of Christ; but as to this beholding of his glory by constant
   meditation and acting of faith therein, they know nothing of it, nor
   are concerned in it. The doctrine which they are taught out of the
   Scripture concerning the person of Christ, they give their assent unto;
   but his glory they hope they shall see in another world; -- here they
   never yet inquired after it.
				</p><p>
   So it will be. It is well if these things be not only neglected,
   because the minds of men are carnal, and cannot discern spiritual
   things, but also despised, because they have an enmity unto them. It is
   not for all to walk in these retired paths; -- not for them who are
   negligent and slothful whose minds are earthly and carnal. Nor can they
   herein sit at the feet of Christ with Mary when she chose the better
   part, who, like Martha, are cumbered about many things here in this
   world. Those whose principal design is to add unto their present
   enjoyments (in the midst of the prosecution whereof they are commonly
   taken from them, so as that their thoughts do perish, because not
   accomplished) will never understand these things. Much less will they
   do so, whose work it is to make provision for the flesh, to fulfil it
   in the lusts thereof.
				</p><p>
   They must make it their design to be heavenly-minded who will find a
   relish in these things. Those who are strangers unto holy meditation in
   general will be strangers unto this mystery in a peculiar manner.
				</p><p>
   Some men can think of the world, of their relations, and the manifold
   occasions of life; but as unto the things that are above, and within
   the veil, they are not concerned in them.
				</p><p>
   With some it is otherwise. They profess their desire to behold the
   glory of Christ by faith; but they find it, as they complain, too high
   and difficult for them. They are at a loss in their minds, and even
   overwhelmed, when they begin to view his glory. They are like the
   disciples who saw him in his transfiguration; -- they were filled with
   amazement, and knew not what to say, or said they knew not what. And I
   do acknowledge, that the weakness of our minds in the comprehension of
   this eternal glory of Christ, and their instability in meditations
   thereon, whence we cannot steadfastly look on it or behold it, gives us
   an afflicting, abasing consideration of our present state and
   condition. And I shall say no more unto this case but this alone: When
   faith can no longer hold open the eyes of our understandings unto the
   beholding the Sun of Righteousness shining in his beauty, nor exercise
   orderly thoughts about this incomprehensible object, it will betake
   itself unto that holy admiration which we have spoken unto; and therein
   it will put itself forth in pure acts of love and complacency.

<title>Chapter 4 The glory of Christ in his susception of the office of a mediator first in his condescension</title>
<p>   The things whereof we have thus far discoursed, relating immediately
   unto the person of Christ in itself, may seem to have somewhat of
   difficulty in them unto such whose minds are not duly exercised in the
   contemplation of heavenly things. Unto others they are evident in their
   own experience, and instructive unto them that are willing to learn.
   That which remains will be yet more plain unto the understanding and
   capacity of the meanest believer. And this is, the glory of Christ in
   his office of mediator, and the discharge thereof.
				</p><p>
   In our beholding of the glory of Christ herein does the exercise of
   faith in this life principally consist; so the apostle declares it,
   <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8 Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:8, 10</reference>, "Yea doubtless, and I count all things loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: that I may know
   him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his
   sufferings, being made conformable unto his death." This therefore, we
   must treat of somewhat more at large.
				</p><p>
   "There is one God," saith the apostle, "and one mediator between God
   and men, the man Christ Jesus," <reference osisRef="1Tim.2.5">1 Timothy 2:5</reference> In that great difference
   between God and man occasioned by our sin and apostasy from him, which
   of itself could issue in nothing but the utter ruin of the whole race
   of mankind, there was none in heaven or earth, in their original nature
   and operations, who was meet or able to make up righteous peace between
   them. Yet must this be done by a mediator, or cease for ever.
				</p><p>
   This mediator could not be God himself absolutely considered; for "a
   mediator is not of one, but God is one," <reference osisRef="Gal.3.20">Galatians 3:20</reference> Whatever God
   might do herein in a way of sovereign grace, yet he could not do it in
   the way of mediation; which yet was necessary unto his own glory, as we
   have at large discoursed elsewhere.
				</p><p>
   And as for creatures, there was none in heaven or earth that was meet
   to undertake this office. For "if one man sin against another, the
   judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall
   entreat for him?" <reference osisRef="1Sam.2.25">1 Samuel 2:25</reference> There is not "any days-man betwixt us,
   that might lay his hand upon us both," <reference osisRef="Job.9.33">Job 9:33</reference>
				</p><p>
   In this state of things the Lord Christ, as the Son of God, said, "Lo,
   I come to do thy will, O God. Sacrifice and burnt-offerings thou
   wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me; and, lo, I come to do
   thy will," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.5 Heb.10.9">Hebrews 10:5, 9</reference> By the assumption of our nature into union
   with himself, in his own divine person he became every way meet for the
   discharge of this office, and undertakes it accordingly.
				</p><p>
   That which we inquire after at present, is, the glory of Christ herein,
   and how we may behold that glory. And there are three things wherein we
   may take a prospect of it.
				</p><p>
   1. In his susception of this office.
				</p><p>
   2. In his discharge of it.
				</p><p>
   3. In the event and consequence thereof, or what ensued thereon.
				</p><p>
   In the susception of this office we may behold the glory of Christ, --
   I. In his condescension; II. In his love.
				</p><p>
   I. We may behold this glory in his infinite condescension to take this
   office on him, and our nature to be his own unto that end. It did not
   befall him by lot or chance; -- it was not imposed on him against his
   will; -- it belonged not unto him by any necessity of nature or
   condition, he stood not in need of it; -- it was no addition unto him;
   but of his own mind and accord he graciously condescended unto the
   susception and discharge of it.
				</p><p>
   So the apostle expresseth it, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5 Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:5-8</reference>, "Let this mind be in you
   which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought
   it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation,
   and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness
   of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
   became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
				</p><p>
   It was the mind that was in Jesus Christ which is proposed unto our
   consideration and imitation, -- what he was inclined and disposed unto
   from himself and his own mind alone. And that in general which is
   ascribed unto him is kenosis, exinanition, or self-emptying; he emptied
   himself. This the ancient church called his sunkatabasis, as we do his
   condescension; an act of which kind in God is called the "humbling of
   himself," <reference osisRef="Ps.113.6">Psalms 113:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   Wherefore, the susception of our nature for the discharge of the office
   of mediation therein was an infinite condescension in the Son of God,
   wherein he is exceedingly glorious in the eyes of believers.
				</p><p>
   And I shall do these three things:  1. Show in general the greatness
   of his condescension; 2. Declare the especial nature of it; and, 3.
   Take what view we are able of the glory of Christ therein.
				</p><p>
   1. Such is the transcendent excellency of the divine nature, that it is
   said of God that he "dwelleth on high," and "humbleth himself to behold
   the things that are in heaven, and in the earth," <reference osisRef="Ps.113.5 Ps.113.6">Psalms 113:5-6</reference> He
   condescends from the prerogative of his excellency to behold, to look
   upon, to take notice of, the most glorious things in heaven above, and
   the greatest things in the earth below. All his respect unto the
   creatures, the most glorious of them, is an act of infinite
   condescension. And it is so on two accounts.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Because of the infinite distance that is between his essence,
   nature, or being, and that of the creatures. Hence all nations before
   him "are as the drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of
   the balance;" yea, that they "are as nothing, that they are counted
   unto him less than nothing, and vanity." All being is essentially in
   him, and in comparison thereunto all other things are as nothing. And
   there are no measures, there is no proportion between infinite being
   and nothing, -- nothing that should induce a regard from the one unto
   the other. Wherefore, the infinite, essential greatness of the nature
   of God, with his infinite distance from the nature of all creatures
   thereby, causeth all his dealings with them to be in the way of
   condescension or humbling himself. So it is expressed, <reference osisRef="Isa.57.15">Isaiah 57:15</reference>,
   "Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, I dwell in
   the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble
   spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of
   the contrite ones." He is so the high and lofty one, and so inhabiteth
   eternity, or existeth in his own eternal being, that it is an act of
   mere grace in him to take notice of things below; and therefore he does
   it in an especial manner of those whom the world does most despise.
				</p><p>
   (2.) It ariseth from his infinite self-sufficiency unto all the acts
   and ends of his own eternal blessedness. What we have a regard unto,
   what we respect and desire, it is that it may add unto our
   satisfaction. So it is, so it must be, with every creature; no creature
   is self-sufficient unto its own blessedness. The human nature of Christ
   himself in heaven is not so; it lives in God, and God in it, in a full
   dependence on God, and in receiving blessed and glorious communications
   from him. No rational creature, angel or man, can do, think, act any
   thing, but it is all to add to their perfection and satisfaction; --
   they are not self-sufficient. God alone wants nothing, stands in need
   of nothing; nothing can be added unto him, seeing he "giveth unto all
   life, and breath, and all things," <reference osisRef="Acts.17.25">Acts 17:25</reference> The whole creation,
   in all its excellency, cannot contribute one mite unto the satisfaction
   or blessedness of God. He has it all in infinite perfection from
   himself and in his own nature. Our goodness extends not unto him. A man
   cannot profit God, as he may profit his neighbour. "If thou sinnest,
   what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied,
   what doest thou unto him?" God loseth nothing of his own
   self-sufficiency and blessedness therein by all this. And "if thou be
   righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?"
   <reference osisRef="Job.35.6 Job.35.7">Job 35:6-7</reference> And from hence also it follows that all God's
   concernment in the creation is by an act of condescension.
				</p><p>
   How glorious, then, is the condescension of the Son of God in his
   susception of the office of mediation! For if such be the perfection of
   the divine nature, and its distance so absolutely infinite from the
   whole creation, -- and if such be his self-sufficiency unto his own
   eternal blessedness, as that nothing can be taken from him, nothing
   added unto him, so that every regard in him unto any of the creatures
   is an act of self-humiliation and condescension from the prerogative of
   his being and state, -- what heart can conceive, what tongue can
   express, the glory of that condescension in the Son of God, whereby he
   took our nature upon him, took it to be his own, in order unto a
   discharge of the office of mediation on our behalf?
				</p><p>
   2. But, that we may the better behold the glory of Christ herein, we
   may briefly consider the especial nature of this condescension, and
   wherein it does consist.
				</p><p>
   But whereas not only the denial, but misapprehensions hereof, have
   pestered the church of God in all ages, we must, in the first place,
   reject them, and then declare the truth.
				</p><p>
   (1.) This condescension of the Son of God did not consist in a laying
   aside, or parting with, or separation from, the divine nature, so as
   that he should cease to be God by being man. The foundation of it lay
   in this, that he was "in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to
   be equal with God," <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6">Philippians 2:6</reference>; -- that is, being really and
   essentially God in his divine nature, he professed himself therein to
   be equal with God, or the person of the Father. He was in the form of
   God, -- that is, he was God, participant of the Divine nature, for God
   has no form but that of his essence and being; and hence he was equal
   with God, in authority, dignity, and power. Because he was in the form
   of God, he must be equal with God; for there is order in the Divine
   Persons, but no inequality in the Divine Being. So the Jews understood
   him, that when he said, "God was his Father, he made himself equal with
   God." For in his so saying, he ascribed unto himself equal power with
   the Father, as unto all divine operations. "My Father," saith he,
   "worketh hitherto, and I work," <reference osisRef="John.5.17 John.5.18">John 5:17-18</reference> And they by whom his
   divine nature is denied do cast this condescension of Christ quite out
   of our religion, as that which has no reality or substance in it. But
   we shall speak of them afterward.
				</p><p>
   Being in this state, it is said that he took on him the form of a
   servant, and was found in fashion as a man, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.7">Philippians 2:7</reference> This is his
   condescension. It is not said that he ceased to be in the form of God;
   but continuing so to be, he "took upon him the form of a servant" in
   our nature: he became what he was not, but he ceased not to be what he
   was. So he testifieth of himself, <reference osisRef="John.3.13">John 3:13</reference>, "No man has ascended up
   to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man which is
   in heaven." Although he was then on earth as the Son of man, yet he
   ceased not to be God thereby; -- in his divine nature he was then also
   in heaven.
				</p><p>
   He who is God, can no more be not God, than he who is not God can be
   God; and our difference with the Socinians herein is, -- we believe
   that Christ being God, was made man for our sakes; they say, that being
   only a man, he was made a god for his own sake.
				</p><p>
   This, then, is the foundation of the glory of Christ in this
   condescension, the life and soul of all heavenly truth and mysteries,
   -- namely, that the Son of God becoming in time to be what he was not,
   the Son of man, ceased not thereby to be what he was, even the eternal
   Son of God. Wherefore, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) Much less did this condescension consist in the conversion of the
   divine nature into the human, -- which was the imagination of some of
   the Arians of old; and we have yet (to my own knowledge) some that
   follow them in the same dotage. They say that the "Word which was in
   the beginning," by which all things were made, being in itself an
   effect of the divine will and power, was in the fulness of time turned
   into flesh; -- that is, the substance of it was so, as the water in the
   miracle wrought by our Saviour was turned into wine; for, by an act of
   the divine power of Christ, it ceased to be water substantially, and
   was wine only, -- not water mixed with wine. So these men suppose a
   substantial change of the one nature into the other, -- of the divine
   nature into the human, -- like what the Papists imagine in their
   transubstantiation. So they say God was made man, his essence being
   turned into that of a man.
				</p><p>
   But this no way belongs unto the condescension of Christ. We may call
   it Ichabod, -- it has no glory in it. It destroys both his natures, and
   leaves him a person in whom we are not concerned. For, according unto
   this imagination, that divine nature, wherein he was in the form of
   God, did in its own form cease to be, yea, was utterly destroyed, as
   being substantially changed into the nature of man, as the water did
   cease to be when it was turned into wine; and that human nature which
   was made thereof has no alliance or kindred unto us or our nature,
   seeing it was not "made of a woman," but of the substance of the Word.
				</p><p>
   (3.) There was not in this condescension the least change or alteration
   in the divine nature. Eutyches and those that followed him of old
   conceived that the two natures of Christ, the divine and human, were
   mixed and compounded, as it were, into one. And this could not be
   without an alteration in the divine nature, for it would be made to be
   essentially what it was not; -- for one nature has but one and the same
   essence.
				</p><p>
   But, as we said before, although the Lord Christ himself in his person
   was made to be what he was not before, in that our nature hereby was
   made to be his, yet his divine nature was not so. There is in it
   neither "variableness nor shadow of turning." It abode the same in him,
   in all its essential properties, acting, and blessedness, as it was
   from eternity. It neither did, acted, nor suffered any thing but what
   is proper unto the Divine Being. The Lord Christ did and suffered many
   things in life and death, in his own person, by his human person,
   wherein the divine neither did nor suffered any thing at all --
   although, in the doing of them, his person be denominated from that
   nature; so, "God purchased his church with his own blood," <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference>
				</p><p>
   (4.) It may, then, be said, What did the Lord Christ, in this
   condescension, with respect unto his divine nature? The apostle tells
   us that he "humbled himself, and made himself of no reputation," <reference osisRef="Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:7-8</reference> He veiled the glory of his divine nature in ours, and what he
   did therein, so as that there was no outward appearance or
   manifestation of it. The world hereon was so far from looking on him as
   the true God, that it believed him not to be a good man. Hence they
   could never bear the least intimation of his divine nature, supposing
   themselves secured from any such thing, because they looked on him with
   their eyes to be a man, -- as he was, indeed, no less truly and really
   than any one of themselves. Wherefore, on that testimony given of
   himself, "Before Abraham was, I am," -- which asserts a pre-existence
   from eternity in another nature than what they saw, -- they were filled
   with rage, and "took up stones to cast at him," <reference osisRef="John.8.58 John.8.59">John 8:58-59</reference> And
   they gave reason of their madness, <reference osisRef="John.10.33">John 10:33</reference>, -- namely, that "he,
   being a man, should make himself to be God." This was such a thing,
   they thought, as could never enter into the heart of a wise and sober
   man, -- namely, that being so, owning himself to be such, he should yet
   say of himself that he was God. This is that which no reason can
   comprehend, which nothing in nature can parallel or illustrate, that
   one and the same person should be both God and man. And this is the
   principal plea of the Socinians at this day, who, through the
   Mohammedans, succeed unto the Jews in an opposition unto the divine
   nature of Christ.
				</p><p>
   But all this difficulty is solved by the glory of Christ in this
   condescension; for although in himself, or his own divine person, he
   was "over all, God blessed for ever," yet he humbled himself for the
   salvation of the church, unto the eternal glory of God, to take our
   nature upon him, and to be made man: and those who cannot see a divine
   glory in his so doing, do neither know him, nor love him, nor believe
   in him, nor do any way belong unto him.
				</p><p>
   So is it with the men of these abominations. Because they cannot behold
   the glory hereof, they deny the foundation of our religion, -- namely,
   the divine person of Christ. Seeing he would be made man, he shall be
   esteemed by them no more than a man. So do they reject that glory of
   God, his infinite wisdom, goodness, and grace, wherein he is more
   concerned than in the whole creation. And they dig up the root of all
   evangelical truths, which are nothing but branches from it.
				</p><p>
   It is true, and must be confessed, that herein it is that our Lord
   Jesus Christ is "a stumbling-stone and a rock of offence" unto the
   world. If we should confess him only as a prophet, a man sent by God,
   there would not be much contest about him, nor opposition unto him. The
   Mohammedans do all acknowledge it, and the Jews would not long deny it;
   for their hatred against him was, and is, solely because he professed
   himself to be God, and as such was believed on in the world. And at
   this day, partly through the insinuation of the Socinians, and partly
   from the efficacy of their own blindness and unbelief, multitudes are
   willing to grant him to be a prophet sent of God, who do not, who will
   not, who cannot, believe the mystery of this condescension in the
   susception of our nature, nor see the glory of it. But take this away,
   and all our religion is taken away with it. Farewell Christianity, as
   to the mystery, the glory, the truth, the efficacy of it; -- let a
   refined heathenism be established in its room. But this is the rock on
   which the church is built, against which the gates of hell shall not
   prevail.
				</p><p>
   (5.) This condescension of Christ was not by a phantasm or an
   appearance only. One of the first heresies that pestered the church
   immediately after the days of the apostles was this, that all that was
   done or suffered by Christ as a man were not the acts, doings or
   sufferings of one that was truly and really a man, but an outward
   representation of things, like the appearance of angels in the shape of
   men, eating and drinking, under the Old Testament; and suitably
   hereunto some in our days have spoken, -- namely, that there was only
   an appearance of Christ in the man Jesus at Jerusalem, in whom he
   suffered no more than in other believers. [3] But the ancient
   Christians told those men the truth, -- namely, that "as they had
   feigned unto themselves an imaginary Christ, so they should have an
   imaginary salvation only."
				</p><p>
   But the true nature of this divine condescension does consist in these
   three things: 
				</p><p>
   1. That "the eternal person of the Son of God, or the divine nature in
   the person of the Son, did, by an ineffable act of his divine power and
   love, assume our nature into an individual subsistence in or with
   himself; that is, to be his own, even as the divine nature is his."
   This is the infallible foundation of faith, even to them who can
   comprehend very little of these divine mysteries. They can and do
   believe that the Son of God did take our nature to be his own; so as
   that whatever was done therein was done by him, as it is with every
   other man. Every man has human nature appropriated unto himself by an
   individual subsistence, whereby he becomes to be that man which he is
   and not another; or that nature which is common unto all, becomes in
   him to be peculiarly his own, as if there were none partaker of it but
   himself. Adam, in his first creation, when all human nature was in him
   alone, was no more that individual man which he was, than every man is
   now the man that he is, by his individual subsistence. So the Lord
   Christ taking that nature which is common unto all into a peculiar
   subsistence in his own person, it becometh his, and he the man Christ
   Jesus. This was the mind that was in him.
				</p><p>
   2. By reason of this assumption of our nature, with his doing and
   suffering therein whereby he was found in fashion as a man, the glory
   of his divine person was veiled, and he made himself of no reputation.
   This also belongs unto his condescension, as the first general effect
   and fruit of it. But we have spoken of it before.
				</p><p>
   3. It is also to be observed, that in the assumption of our nature to
   be his own, he did not change it into a thing divine and spiritual; but
   preserved it entire in all its essential properties and actings. Hence
   it really did and suffered, was tried, tempted, and forsaken, as the
   same nature in any other man might do and be. That nature (as it was
   peculiarly his, and therefore he, or his person therein) was exposed
   unto all the temporary evils which the same nature is subject unto in
   any other person.
				</p><p>
   This is a short general view of this incomprehensible condescension of
   the Son of God, as it is described by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5 Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:5-8</reference> And
   this is that wherein in an especial manner we are to behold the glory
   of Christ by faith whilst we are in this world.
				</p><p>
   But had we the tongue of men and angels, we were not able in any just
   measure to express the glory of this condescension; for it is the most
   ineffable effect of the divine wisdom of the Father and of the love of
   the Son, -- the highest evidence of the care of God towards mankind.
   What can be equal unto it? what can be like it? It is the glory of
   Christian religion, and the animating soul of all evangelical truth.
   This carrieth the mystery of the wisdom of God above the reason or
   understanding of men and angels, to be the object of faith and
   admiration only. A mystery it is that becomes the greatness of God,
   with his infinite distance from the whole creation, -- which renders it
   unbecoming him that all his ways and works should be comprehensible by
   any of his creatures, <reference osisRef="Job.11.7 Job.11.8 Job.11.9">Job 11:7-9</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.11.33 Rom.11.34 Rom.11.35 Rom.11.36">Romans 11:33-36</reference>
				</p><p>
   He who was eternally in the form of God, -- that is, was essentially
   so, God by nature, equally participant of the same divine nature with
   God the Father; "God over all, blessed for ever;" who humbleth himself
   to behold the things that are in heaven and earth, -- he takes on him
   the nature of man, takes it to be his own, whereby he was no less truly
   a man in time than he was truly God from eternity. And to increase the
   wonder of this mystery, because it was necessary unto the end he
   designed, he so humbled himself in this assumption of our nature, as to
   make himself of no reputation in this world, -- yea, unto that degree,
   that he said of himself that he was a worm, and no man, in comparison
   of them who were of any esteem.
				</p><p>
   We speak of these things in a poor, low, broken manner, -- we teach
   them as they are revealed in the Scripture, -- we labour by faith to
   adhere unto them as revealed; but when we come into a steady, direct
   view and consideration of the thing itself, our minds fail, our hearts
   tremble, and we can find no rest but in a holy admiration of what we
   cannot comprehend. Here we are at a loss, and know that we shall be so
   whilst we are in this world; but all the ineffable fruits and benefits
   of this truth are communicated unto them that do believe.
				</p><p>
   It is with reference hereunto that that great promise concerning him is
   given unto the church, <reference osisRef="Isa.8.14">Isaiah 8:14</reference>, "He shall be for a sanctuary"
   (namely, unto all that believe, as it is expounded, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.7 1Pet.2.8">1 Peter 2:7-8</reference>);
   "but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence," -- "even to
   them that stumble at the word, being disobedient; whereunto also they
   were appointed."
				</p><p>
   He is herein a sanctuary, an assured refuge unto all that betake
   themselves unto him. What is it that any man in distress, who flies
   whereunto, may look for in a sanctuary? A supply of all his wants, a
   deliverance from all his fears, a defence against all his dangers, is
   proposed unto him therein. Such is the Lord Christ herein unto
   sin-distressed souls; he is a refuge unto us in all spiritual diseases
   and disconsolations, <reference osisRef="Heb.6.18">Hebrews 6:18</reference> See the exposition of the place. [4]
   Are we, or any of us, burdened with a sense of sin? are we perplexed
   with temptations? are we bowed down under the oppression of any
   spiritual adversary? do we, on any of these accounts, "walk in darkness
   and have no light?" One view of the glory of Christ herein is able to
   support us and relieve us.
				</p><p>
   Unto whom we betake ourselves for relief in any case, we have regard to
   nothing but their will and their power. If they have both, we are sure
   of relief. And what shall we fear in the will of Christ as unto this
   end? What will he not do for us? He who thus emptied and humbled
   himself, who so infinitely condescended from the prerogative of his
   glory in his being and self-sufficiency, in the susception of our
   nature for the discharge of the office of a mediator on our behalf, --
   will he not relieve us in all our distresses? will he not do all for us
   we stand in need of, that we may be eternally saved? will he not be a
   sanctuary unto us? Nor have we hereon any ground to fear his power;
   for, by this infinite condescension to be a suffering man, he lost
   nothing of his power as God omnipotent, -- nothing of his infinite
   wisdom or glorious grace. He could still do all that he could do as God
   from eternity. If there be any thing, therefore, in a coalescency of
   infinite power with infinite condescension, to constitute a sanctuary
   for distressed sinners, it is all in Christ Jesus. And if we see him
   not glorious herein, it is because there is no light of faith in us.
				</p><p>
   This, then, is the rest wherewith we may cause the weary to rest, and
   this is the refreshment. Herein is he "a hiding-place from the wind,
   and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, and
   as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land." Hereon he says, "I have
   satiated the weary soul, and have refreshed every sorrowful soul."
   Under this consideration it is that, in all evangelical promises and
   invitations for coming to him, he is proposed unto distressed sinners
   as their only sanctuary.
				</p><p>
   Herein is he "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence" unto the
   unbelieving and disobedient, who stumble at the word. They cannot, they
   will not, see the glory of this condescension; -- they neither desire
   nor labour so to do, -- yea, they hate it and despise it. Christ in it
   is "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence" unto them. Wherefore
   they choose rather utterly to deny his divine person than allow that he
   did thus abase himself for our sakes. Rather than they will own this
   glory, they will allow him no glory. A man they say he was, and no
   more; and this was his glory. This is that principle of darkness and
   unbelief which works effectually at this day in the minds of many. They
   think it an absurd thing, as the Jews did of old, that he, being a man,
   should be God also; or, on the other hand, that the Son of God should
   thus condescend to take our nature on him. This they can see no glory
   in, no relief, no refuge, no refreshment unto their souls in any of
   their distresses; therefore do they deny his divine person. Here faith
   triumphs against them; it finds that to be a glorious sanctuary which
   they cannot at all discern.
				</p><p>
   But it is not so much the declaration or vindication of this glory of
   Christ which I am at present engaged in, as an exhortation unto the
   practical contemplation of it in a way of believing. And I know that
   among many this is too much neglected; yea, of all the evils which I
   have seen in the days of my pilgrimage, now drawing to their close,
   there is none so grievous as the public contempt of the principal
   mysteries of the Gospel among them that are called Christians.
   Religion, in the profession of some men, is withered in its vital
   principles, weakened in its nerves and sinews; but thought to be put
   off with outward gaiety and bravery.
				</p><p>
   But my exhortation is unto diligence in the contemplation of this glory
   of Christ, and the exercise of our thoughts about it. Unless we are
   diligent herein, it is impossible we should be steady in the principal
   acts of faith, or ready unto the principal duties of obedience. The
   principal act of faith respects the divine person of Christ, as all
   Christians must acknowledge. This we can never secure (as has been
   declared) if we see not his glory in this condescension: and whoever
   reduceth his notions unto experience, will find that herein his faith
   stands or falls. And the principal duty of our obedience is
   self-denial, with readiness for the cross. Hereunto the consideration
   of this condescension of Christ is the principal evangelical motive,
   and that whereinto our obedience in it is to be resolved; as the
   apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5 Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:5-8</reference> And no man does deny himself in a due
   manner, who does it not on the consideration of the self-denial of the
   Son of God. But a prevalent motive this is thereunto. For what are the
   things wherein we are to deny ourselves, or forego what we pretend to
   have a right unto? It is in our goods, our liberties, our relations, --
   our lives. And what are they, any or all of them, in themselves, or
   unto us, considering our condition, and the end for which we were made?
   Perishing things, which, whether we will or no, within a few days death
   will give us an everlasting separation from, under the power of a fever
   or an asthma, etc.., as unto our interest in them. But how incomparable
   with respect hereunto is that condescension of Christ, whereof we have
   given an account! If, therefore, we find an unwillingness in us, a
   tergiversation in our minds about these things, when called unto them
   in a way of duty, one view by faith of the glory of Christ in this
   condescension, and what he parted from therein when he "made himself of
   no reputation," will be an effectual cure of that sinful distemper.
				</p><p>
   Herein, then, I say, we may by faith behold the glory of Christ, as we
   shall do it by sight hereafter. If we see no glory in it, if we discern
   not that which is matter of eternal admiration, we walk in darkness. It
   is the most ineffable effect of divine wisdom and grace. Where are our
   hearts and minds, if we can see no glory in it? I know in the
   contemplation of it, it will quickly overwhelm our reason, and bring
   our understanding into a loss: but unto this loss do I desire to be
   brought every day; for when faith can no more act itself in
   comprehension, when it finds the object it is fixed on too great and
   glorious to be brought into our minds and capacities, it will issue (as
   we said before) in holy admiration, humble adoration, and joyful
   thanksgiving. In and by its acting in them does it fill the soul with
   "joy unspeakable, and full of glory."

<p>   [3] The Docet�, to whom Dr Owen refers, were a sect of the Asiatic
   Gnostics. The founder of the sect was Marcion, who was born in Pontus,
   near the beginning of the second century. He held that Christ was a
   manifestation of God under the appearance of man. The name was applied
   to some who, in the beginning of the sixth century, held that the body
   of Christ was not created, and therefore, that he only appeared to
   sleep, hunger, thirst, and suffer. -- Ed.

   is nothing of dread or terror accompanying it, -- nothing but what is
   amiable and infinitely refreshing. Now, that we may take a view of the
   glory of Christ herein by faith, the nature of it must be inquired
   into.
				</p><p>
   1. The eternal disposing cause of the whole work wherein the Lord
   Christ was engaged by the susception of this office, for the redemption
   and salvation of the church, is the love of the Father. Hereunto it is
   constantly ascribed in the Scripture. And this love of the Father acted
   itself in his eternal decrees, "before the foundation of the world,"
   <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</reference>; and afterward in the sending of his Son to render it
   effectual, <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference> Originally, it is his eternal election of a
   portion of mankind to be brought unto the enjoyment of himself, through
   the mystery of the blood of Christ, and the sanctification of the
   Spirit, <reference osisRef="2Thess.2.13 2Thess.2.16">2 Thessalonians 2:13, 16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4 Eph.1.5 Eph.1.6 Eph.1.7 Eph.1.8 Eph.1.9">Ephesians 1:4-9</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.2">1 Peter 1:2</reference>
				</p><p>
   This eternal act of the will of God the Father does not contain in it
   an actual approbation of, and complacency in, the state and condition
   of those that are elected; but only designeth that for them on the
   account whereof they shall be accepted and approved. And it is called
   his love on sundry accounts.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Because it is an act suited unto that glorious excellency of his
   nature wherein he is love; for "God is love," <reference osisRef="1John.4.8 1John.4.9">1 John 4:8-9</reference> And the
   first egress of the divine properties must, therefore, be in an act of
   communicative love. And whereas this election, being an eternal act of
   the will of God, can have no moving cause but what is in himself, -- if
   we could look into all the treasures of the divine excellencies, we
   should find none whereunto it could be so properly ascribed as unto
   love. Wherefore, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) It is styled love, because it was free and undeserved, as unto
   anything on our part; for whatever good is done unto any altogether
   undeserved, if it be with a design of their profit and advantage, it is
   an act of love, and can have no other cause. So is it with us in
   respect of eternal election. There was nothing in us, nothing foreseen,
   as that which, from ourselves, would be in us, that should any way move
   the will of God unto this election; for whatever is good in the best of
   men is an effect of it, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</reference> Whereas, therefore, it tends unto
   our eternal good, the spring of it must be love. And, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) The fruits or effects of it are inconceivable acts of love. It is
   by multiplied acts of love that it is made effectual; <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="Jer.31.3">Jeremiah 31:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3 Eph.1.4 Eph.1.5">Ephesians 1:3-5</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.4.8 1John.4.9 1John.4.16">1 John 4:8-9, 16</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. This is the eternal spring which is derived unto the church through
   the mediation of Christ. Wherefore, that which put all the design of
   this eternal love of the Father into execution, and wrought out the
   accomplishment of it, was the love of the Son, which we inquire after;
   and light may be given unto it in the ensuing observations: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) The whole number or society of the elect were creatures made in
   the image of God, and thereby in a state of love with him. All that
   they were, had, or hoped for, were effects of divine goodness and love.
   And the life of their souls was love unto God. And a blessed state it
   was, preparatory for the eternal life of love in heaven.
				</p><p>
   (2.) From this state they fell by sin into a state of enmity with God;
   which is comprehensive of all miseries, temporal and eternal.
				</p><p>
   (3.) Notwithstanding this woeful catastrophe of our first state, yet
   our nature, on many accounts, was recoverable unto the enjoyment of
   God; as I have at large elsewhere declared.
				</p><p>
   (4.) In this condition, the first act of love in Christ towards us was
   in pity and compassion. A creature made in the image of God, and fallen
   into misery, yet capable of recovery, is the proper object of divine
   compassion. That which is so celebrated in the Scripture, as the
   bowels, the pity, the compassion of God, is the acting of divine love
   towards us on the consideration of our distress and misery. But all
   compassion ceaseth towards them whose condition is irrecoverable.
   Wherefore the Lord Christ pitied not the angels that fell, because
   their nature was not to be relieved. Of this compassion in Christ, see
   <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.15 Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:14-16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.63.9">Isaiah 63:9</reference>
				</p><p>
   (5.) As then we lay under the eye of Christ in our misery, we were the
   objects of his pity and compassion; but as he looketh on us as
   recoverable out of that state, his love worketh in and by delight. It
   was an inconceivable delight unto him, to take a prospect of the
   deliverance of mankind unto the glory of God; which is also an act of
   love. See this divinely expressed, <reference osisRef="Prov.8.30 Prov.8.31">Proverbs 8:30-31</reference>, as that place
   has been elsewhere explained. [5]
				</p><p>
   (6.) If it be inquired, whence this compassion and delight in him
   should arise, what should be the cause of them, that he who was
   eternally blessed in his own self-sufficiency should so deeply concern
   himself in our lost, forlorn condition? I say it did so merely from the
   infinite love and goodness of his own nature, without the least
   procuring inducement from us or any thing in us, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.5">Titus 3:5</reference>
				</p><p>
   (7.) In this his readiness, willingness, and delight, springing from
   love and compassion, the counsel of God concerning the way of our
   recovery is, as it were, proposed unto him. Now, this was a way of
   great difficulties and perplexities unto himself, -- that is, unto his
   person as it was to be constituted. To the divine nature nothing is
   grievous, -- nothing is difficult; but he was to have another nature,
   wherein he was to undergo the difficulties of this way and work. It was
   required of him that he should pity us until he had none left to pity
   himself when he stood in need of it, -- that he should pursue his
   delight to save us until his own soul was heavy and sorrowful unto
   death, -- that he should relieve us in our sufferings by suffering the
   same things that we should have done. But he was not in the least
   hereby deterred from undertaking this work of love and mercy for us;
   yea, his love rose on this proposal like the waters of a mighty stream
   against opposition. For hereon he says, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O
   God;" -- it is my delight to do it, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.5 Heb.10.6 Heb.10.7">Hebrews 10:5-7</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.50.5 Isa.50.6 Isa.50.7">Isaiah 50:5-7</reference>
				</p><p>
   (8.) Being thus inclined, disposed, and ready, in the eternal love of
   his divine person, to undertake the office of mediation and the work of
   our redemption, a body was prepared for him. In this body or human
   nature, made his own, he was to make this love effectual in all its
   inclinations and actings. It was provided for him unto this end, and
   filled with all grace in a way unmeasurable, especially with fervent
   love unto mankind. And hereby it became a meet instrument to actuate
   his eternal love in all the fruits of it.
				</p><p>
   (9.) It is hence evident, that this glorious love of Christ does not
   consist alone in the eternal acting of his divine person, or the divine
   nature in his person. Such, indeed, is the love of the Father, --
   namely, his eternal purpose for the communication of grace and glory,
   with his acquiescence therein; but there is more in the love of Christ.
   For when he exercised this love he was man also, and not God only. And
   in none of those eternal acts of love could the human nature of Christ
   have any interest or concern; yet is the love of the man Christ Jesus
   celebrated in the Scripture.
				</p><p>
   (10.) Wherefore this love of Christ which we inquire after is the love
   of his person, -- that is, which he in his own person acts in and by
   his distinct natures, according unto their distinct essential
   properties. And the acts of love in these distinct natures are
   infinitely distinct and different; yet are they all acts of one and the
   same person. So, then, whether that act of love in Christ which we
   would at any time consider, be an eternal act of the divine nature in
   the person of the Son of God; or whether it be an act of the human,
   performed in time by the gracious faculties and powers of that nature,
   it is still the love of one and the selfsame person, -- Christ Jesus.
				</p><p>
   It was an act of inexpressible love in him, that he assumed our nature,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.17">Hebrews 2:14, 17</reference> But it was an act in and of his divine nature only;
   for it was antecedent unto the existence of his human nature, which
   could not, therefore, concur therein. His laying down his life for us
   was an act of inconceivable love, <reference osisRef="1John.3.16">1 John 3:16</reference> Yet was it only an
   act of the human nature, wherein he offered himself and died. But both
   the one and the other were acts of his divine person; whence it is said
   that God laid down his life for us, and purchased the church with his
   own blood.
				</p><p>
   This is that love of Christ wherein he is glorious, and wherein we are
   by faith to behold his glory. A great part of the blessedness of the
   saints in heaven, and their triumph therein, consists in their
   beholding of this glory of Christ, -- in their thankful contemplation
   of the fruits of it. See <reference osisRef="Rev.5.9 Rev.5.10">Revelation of John 5:9-10</reference>, etc..
				</p><p>
   The illustrious brightness wherewith this glory shines in heaven, the
   all-satisfying sweetness which the view of it gives unto the souls of
   the saints there possessed of glory, are not by us conceivable, nor to
   be expressed. Here, this love passeth knowledge, -- there, we shall
   comprehend the dimensions of it. Yet even here, if we are not slothful
   and carnal, we may have a refreshing prospect of it; and where
   comprehension fails, let admiration take place.
				</p><p>
   My present business is, to exhort others unto the contemplation of it,
   though it be but a little, a very little, a small portion of it, that I
   can conceive; and less than that very little that I can express. Yet
   may it be my duty to excite not only myself, but others also, unto due
   inquiries after it; unto which end I offer the things ensuing.
				</p><p>
   1. Labour that your minds may continually be fitted and prepared for
   such heavenly contemplations. If they are carnal and sensual, or need
   with earthly things, a due sense of this love of Christ and its glory
   will not abide in them. Virtue and vice, in their highest degrees, are
   not more diametrically opposite and inconsistent in the same mind, than
   are a habitual course of sensual, worldly thoughts and a due
   contemplation of the glory of the love of Christ; yea, an earnestness
   of spirit, pregnant with a multitude of thoughts about the lawful
   occasions of life, is obstructive of all due communion with the Lord
   Jesus Christ herein.
				</p><p>
   Few there are whose minds are prepared in a due manner for this duty.
   The actions and communications of the most evidence what is the inward
   frame of their souls. They rove up and down in their thoughts, which
   are continually led by their affections into the corners of the earth.
   It is in vain to call such persons unto contemplations of the glory of
   Christ in his love. A holy composure of mind, by virtue of spiritual
   principles, an inclination to seek after refreshment in heavenly
   things, and to bathe the soul in the fountain of them, with constant
   apprehensions of the excellency of this divine glory, are required
   hereunto.
				</p><p>
   2. Be not satisfied with general notions concerning the love of Christ,
   which represent no glory unto the mind, wherewith many deceive
   themselves. All who believe his divine person, profess a valuation of
   his love, -- and think them not Christians who are otherwise minded;
   but they have only general notions, and not any distinct conceptions of
   it, and really know not what it is. To deliver us from this snare,
   peculiar meditations on its principal concerns are required of us. As,
   --
				</p><p>
   (1.) Whose love it is, -- namely, of the divine person of the Son of
   God. He is expressly called God, with respect unto the exercise of this
   love, that we may always consider whose it is, <reference osisRef="1John.3.16">1 John 3:16</reference>, "Hereby
   perceive we the love [of God], because he laid down his life for us."
				</p><p>
   (2.) By what ways and means this wonderful love of the Son of God does
   act itself, -- namely, in the divine nature, by eternal acts of wisdom,
   goodness, and grace proper thereunto; and in the human, by temporary
   acts of pity or compassion, with all the fruits of them in doing and
   suffering for us. See <reference osisRef="Eph.3.19">Ephesians 3:19</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.15">Hebrews 2:14-15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5">Revelation of John 1:5</reference>
				</p><p>
   (3.) What is the freedom of it, as to any desert on our part, <reference osisRef="1John.4.10">1 John 4:10</reference> It was hatred, not love, that we in ourselves deserved; which
   is a consideration suited to fill the soul with self-abasement, -- the
   best of frames in the contemplation of the glory of Christ.
				</p><p>
   (4.) What is the efficacy of it in its fruits and effects, with sundry
   other considerations of the like nature.
				</p><p>
   By a distinct prospect and admiration of these things, the soul may
   walk in this paradise of God, and gather here and there a heavenly
   flower, conveying unto it a sweet savour of the love of Christ. See
   <reference osisRef="Song.2.2 Song.2.3 Song.2.4">Song of Solomon 2:2-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   Moreover, be not contented to have right notions of the love of Christ
   in your minds, unless you can attain a gracious taste of it in your
   hearts; no more than you would be to see a feast or banquet richly
   prepared, and partake of nothing of it unto your refreshment. It is of
   that nature that we may have a spiritual sensation of it in our minds;
   whence it is compared by the spouse to apples and flagons of wine. We
   may taste that the Lord is gracious; and if we find not a relish of it
   in our hearts, we shall not long retain the notion of it in our minds.
   Christ is the meat, the bread, the food of our souls. Nothing is in him
   of a higher spiritual nourishment than his love, which we should always
   desire.
				</p><p>
   In this love is he glorious; for it is such as no creatures, angels or
   men, could have the least conceptions of, before its manifestation by
   its effects; and, after its manifestation, it is in this world
   absolutely incomprehensible.

<title>Chapter 6 The glory of Christ in the discharge of his mediatory office</title>
<p>   Secondly, As the Lord Christ was glorious in the susception of his
   office, so was he also in its discharge.
				</p><p>
   An unseen glory accompanied him in all that he did, in all that he
   suffered. Unseen it was unto the eyes of the world, but not in His who
   alone can judge of it. Had men seen it, they would not have crucified
   the Lord of glory. Yet to some of them it was made manifest. Hence they
   testified that, in the discharge of his office, they "beheld his glory,
   the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father," <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>; and that
   when others could see neither "form nor comeliness in him that he
   should be desired," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.2">Isaiah 53:2</reference> And so it is at this day. I shall
   only make some few observations; first, on what he did in a way of
   obedience; and then on what he suffered in the discharge of his office
   so undertaken by him.
				</p><p>
   I. 1. What he did, what obedience he yielded unto the law of God in the
   discharge of his office (with respect whereunto he said, "Lo, I come to
   do thy will, O God; yea, thy law is in my heart"), it was all on his
   own free choice or election, and was resolved thereinto alone. It is
   our duty to endeavour after freedom, willingness, and cheerfulness in
   all our obedience. Obedience has its formal nature from our wills. So
   much as there is of our wills in what we do towards God, so much there
   is of obedience, and no more. Howbeit we are, antecedently unto all
   acts of our own wills, obliged unto all that is called obedience. From
   the very constitution of our natures we are necessarily subject unto
   the law of God. All that is left unto us is a voluntary compliance with
   unavoidable commands; with him it was not so. An act of his own will
   and choice preceded all obligation as unto obedience. He obeyed because
   he would, before because he ought. He said, "Lo, I come to do thy will,
   O God," before he was obliged to do that will. By his own choice, and
   that in an act of infinite condescension and love, as we have showed,
   he was "made of a woman," and thereby "made under the law." In his
   divine person he was Lord of the law, -- above it, -- no more obnoxious
   unto its commands than its curse. Neither was he afterwards in himself,
   on his own account, unobnoxious unto its curse merely because he was
   innocent, but also because he was every way above the law itself, and
   all its force.
				</p><p>
   This was the original glory of his obedience. This wisdom, the grace,
   the love, the condescension that was in this choice, animated every
   act, every duty of his obedience, -- rendering it amiable in the sight
   of God, and useful unto us. So, when he went to John to be baptised,
   he, who knew he had no need of it on his own account, would have
   declined the duty of administering that ordinance unto him; but he
   replied, "Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all
   righteousness," <reference osisRef="Matt.3.15">Matthew 3:15</reference> This I have undertaken willingly, of my
   own accord, without any need of it for myself, and therefore will
   discharge it. For him, who was Lord of all universally, thus to submit
   himself to universal obedience, carrieth along with it an evidence of
   glorious grace.
				</p><p>
   2. This obedience, as unto the use and end of it, was not for himself,
   but for us. We were obliged unto it, and could not perform it; -- he
   was not obliged unto it any otherwise but by a free act of his own
   will, and did perform it. God gave him this honour, that he should obey
   for the whole church, -- that by "his obedience many should be made
   righteous," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.19">Romans 5:19</reference> Herein, I say, did God give him honour and
   glory, that his obedience should stand in the stead of the perfect
   obedience of the church as unto justification.
				</p><p>
   3. His obedience being absolutely universal, and absolutely perfect,
   was the great representative of the holiness of God in the law. It was
   represented glorious when the ten words were written by the finger of
   God in tables of stone; it appears yet more eminently in the spiritual
   transcription of it in the hearts of believers: but absolutely and
   perfectly it is exemplified only in the holiness and obedience of
   Christ, which answered it unto the utmost. And this is no small part of
   his glory in obedience, that the holiness of God in the law was
   therein, and therein alone, in that one instance, as unto human nature,
   fully represented.
				</p><p>
   4. He wrought out this obedience against all difficulties and
   oppositions. For although he was absolutely free from that disorder
   which in us has invaded our whole natures, which internally renders all
   obedience difficult unto us, and perfect obedience impossible; yet as
   unto opposition from without, in temptations, sufferings, reproaches,
   contradictions, he met with more than we all. Hence is that glorious
   word, "although he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
   which he suffered," <reference osisRef="Heb.5.8">Hebrews 5:8</reference> See our exposition of that place. But,
   --
				</p><p>
   5. The glory of this obedience ariseth principally from the
   consideration of the person who thus yielded it unto God. This was no
   other but the Son of God made man, -- God and man in one person. He who
   was in heaven, above all, Lord of all, at the same time lived in the
   world in a condition of no reputation, and a course of the strictest
   obedience unto the whole law of God. He unto whom prayer was made,
   prayed himself night and day. He whom all the angels of heaven and all
   creatures worshipped, was continually conversant in all the duties of
   the worship of God. He who was over the house, diligently observed the
   meanest office of the house. He that made all men, in whose hand they
   are all as clay in the hand of the potter, observed amongst them the
   strictest rules of justice, in giving unto every one his due; and of
   charity, in giving good things that were not so due. This is that which
   renders the obedience of Christ in the discharge of his office both
   mysterious and glorious.
				</p><p>
   II. Again, the glory of Christ is proposed unto us in what he suffered
   in the discharge of the office which he had undertaken. There belonged,
   indeed, unto his office, victory, success, and triumph with great
   glory, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.1 Isa.63.2 Isa.63.3 Isa.63.4 Isa.63.5">Isaiah 63:1-5</reference>; but there were sufferings also required of him
   antecedently thereunto: "Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and
   to enter into his glory?"
				</p><p>
   But such were these sufferings of Christ, as that in our thoughts about
   them our minds quickly recoil in a sense of their insufficiency to
   conceive aright of them. Never any one launched into this ocean with
   his meditations, but he quickly found himself unable to fathom the
   depths of it; nor shall I here undertake an inquiry into them. I shall
   only point at this spring of glory, and leave it under a veil.
				</p><p>
   We might here look on him as under the weight of the wrath of God, and
   the curse of the law; taking on himself, and on his whole soul, the
   utmost of evil that God had ever threatened to sin or sinners. We might
   look on him in his agony and bloody sweat, in his strong cries and
   supplications, when he was sorrowful unto the death, and began to be
   amazed, in apprehensions of the things that were coming on him, -- of
   that dreadful trial which he was entering into. We might look upon him
   conflicting with all the powers of darkness, the rage and madness of
   men, -- suffering in his soul, his body, his name, his reputation, his
   goods, his life; some of these sufferings being immediate from God
   above, others from devils and wicked men, acting according to the
   determinate counsel of God. We might look on him praying, weeping,
   crying out, bleeding, dying, -- in all things making his soul an
   offering for sin; so was he "taken from prison, and from judgment: and
   who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off from the land of
   the living: for the transgression," says God, "of my people was he
   smitten," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.8">Isaiah 53:8</reference> But these things I shall not insist on in
   particular, but leave them under such a veil as may give us a prospect
   into them, so far as to fill our souls with holy admiration.
				</p><p>
   Lord, what is man, that thou art thus mindful of him? and the son of
   man, that thou visitest him? Who has known thy mind, or who has been
   thy counsellor? O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
   knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
   finding out! What shall we say unto these things? That God spared not
   his only Son, but gave him up unto death, and all the evils included
   therein, for such poor, lost sinners as we were; -- that for our sakes
   the eternal Son of God should submit himself unto all the evils that
   our natures are obnoxious unto, and that our sins had deserved, that we
   might be delivered!
				</p><p>
   How glorious is the Lord Christ on this account, in the eyes of
   believers! When Adam had sinned, and thereby eternally, according unto
   the sanction of the law, ruined himself and all his posterity, he stood
   ashamed, afraid, trembling, as one ready to perish for ever, under the
   displeasure of God. Death was that which he had deserved, and immediate
   death was that which he looked for. In this state the Lord Christ in
   the promise comes unto him, and says, Poor creature! how woeful is thy
   condition! how deformed is thy appearance! What is become of the
   beauty, of the glory of that image of God wherein thou wast created?
   how hast thou taken on thee the monstrous shape and image of Satan? And
   yet thy present misery, thy entrance into dust and darkness, is no way
   to be compared with what is to ensue. Eternal distress lies at the
   door. But yet look up once more, and behold me, that thou mayest have
   some glimpse of what is in the designs of infinite wisdom, love, and
   grace. Come forth from thy vain shelter, thy hiding-place I will put
   myself into thy condition. I will undergo and bear that burden of guilt
   and punishment which would sink thee eternally into the bottom of hell.
   I will pay that which I never took; and be made temporally a curse for
   thee, that thou mayest attain unto eternal blessedness. To the same
   purpose he speaks unto convinced sinners, in the invitation he gives
   them to come unto him.
				</p><p>
   Thus is the Lord Christ set forth in the Gospel, "evidently crucified"
   before our eyes, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.1">Galatians 3:1</reference>, -- namely, in the representation that is
   made of his glory, -- in the sufferings he underwent for the discharge
   of the office he had undertaken. Let us, then, behold him as poor,
   despised, persecuted, reproached, reviled, hanged on a tree, -- in all,
   labouring under a sense of the wrath of God due unto our sins. Unto
   this end are they recorded in the gospel, -- read, preached, and
   presented unto us. But what can we see herein? -- what glory is in
   these things? Are not these the things which all the world of Jews and
   Gentiles stumbled and took offence at? -- those wherein he was
   appointed to be a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence? Was it not
   esteemed a foolish thing, to look for help and deliverance by the
   miseries of another? -- to look for life by his death? The apostle
   declares at large that such it was esteemed, 1 Cor. i. So was it in the
   wisdom of the world. But even on the account of these things is he
   honourable, glorious, and precious in the sight of them that do
   believe, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.6 1Pet.2.7">1 Peter 2:6-7</reference> For even herein he was "the power of God, and
   the wisdom of God," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.24">1 Corinthians 1:24</reference> And the apostle declares at large the
   grounds and reasons of the different thoughts and apprehensions of men
   concerning the cross and sufferings of Christ, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.3 2Cor.4.4 2Cor.4.5 2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</reference>

<title>Chapter 7 The glory of Christ in his exaltation after the accomplishment of the work of mediation in this world</title>
<p>   We may, in the next place, behold the glory of Christ, with respect
   unto his office, in the actings of God towards him which ensued on his
   discharge of it in this world, in his own exaltation.
				</p><p>
   These are the two heads whereunto all the prophecies and predictions
   concerning Jesus Christ under the Old Testament are referred, --
   namely, his sufferings, and the glory that ensued thereon, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11">1 Peter 1:11</reference> All the prophets testified beforehand "of the Sufferings of Christ,
   and the glory that should follow." So when he himself opened the
   Scriptures unto his disciples, he gave them this as the sum of the
   doctrine contained in them, "Ought not Christ to have suffered these
   things, and to enter into his glory?" <reference osisRef="Luke.24.26">Luke 24:26</reference> The same is
   frequently expressed elsewhere, <reference osisRef="Rom.14.9">Romans 14:9</reference>; <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5 Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8 Phil.2.9">Philippians 2:5-9</reference>
				</p><p>
   So much as we know of Christ, his sufferings, and his glory, so much do
   we understand of the Scripture, and no more.
				</p><p>
   These are the two heads of the mediation of Christ and his kingdom, and
   this is their order which they communicate unto the church, -- first
   sufferings, and then glory: "If we suffer, we shall also reign with
   him," <reference osisRef="2Tim.2.12">2 Timothy 2:12</reference> They do but deceive themselves who design any
   other method of these things. Some would reign here in this world; and
   we may say, with the apostle, "Would you did reign, that we might reign
   with you." But the members of the mystical body must be conformed unto
   the Head. In him sufferings went before glory; and so they must in
   them. The order in the kingdom of Satan and the world is contrary
   hereunto. First the good things of this life, and then eternal misery,
   is the method of that kingdom, <reference osisRef="Luke.16.25">Luke 16:25</reference>
				</p><p>
   These are the two springs of the salvation of the church, -- the two
   anointed ones that stand before the Lord of the whole earth, from which
   all the golden oil, whereby the church is dedicated unto God and
   sanctified, does flow. This glory of Christ in his exaltation, which
   followed on his sufferings, is that which we now inquire into. And we
   shall state our apprehensions of it in the ensuing observations: 
				</p><p>
   1. This is peculiarly that glory which the Lord Christ prays that his
   disciples may be where he is to behold it. It is not solely so, as it
   is considered absolutely; but it is that wherein all the other parts of
   his glory are made manifest. It is the evidence, the pledge, the means
   of the manifestation of them all. As unto all the instances of his
   glory before insisted on, there was a veil drawn over them whilst he
   was in this world. Hence the most saw nothing of it, and the best saw
   it but obscurely. But in this glory that veil is taken off, whereby the
   whole glory of his person in itself and in the work of mediation is
   most illustriously manifested. When we shall immediately behold this
   glory, we shall see him as he is. This is that glory whereof the Father
   made grant unto him before the foundation of the world, and wherewith
   he was actually invested upon his ascension.
				</p><p>
   2. By this glory of Christ I do not understand the essential glory of
   his divine nature, or his being absolutely in his own person "over all,
   God blessed for ever;" but the manifestation of this glory in
   particular, after it had been veiled in this world under the "form of a
   servant," belongs hereunto. The divine glory of Christ in his person
   belongs not unto his exaltation; but the manifestation of it does so.
   It was not given him by free donation; but the declaration of it unto
   the church of angels and men after his humiliation was so. He left it
   not whilst he was in this world; but the direct evidence and
   declaration of it he laid aside, until he was "declared to be the Son
   of God with power," by the resurrection from the dead.
				</p><p>
   When the sun is under a total eclipse, he loseth nothing of his native
   beauty, light, and glory. He is still the same that he was from the
   beginning, -- a "great light to rule the day." To us he appears as a
   dark, useless meteor; but when he comes by his course to free himself
   from the lunar interposition, unto his proper aspect towards us, he
   manifests again his native light and glory. So was it with the divine
   nature of Christ, as we have before declared. He veiled the glory of it
   by the interposition of the flesh, or the assumption of our nature to
   be his own; with this addition, that therein he took on him the "form
   of a servant," -- of a person of mean and low degree. But this
   temporary eclipse being past and over, it now shines forth in its
   infinite lustre and beauty, which belongs unto the present exaltation
   of his person. And when those who beheld him here as a poor, sorrowful,
   persecuted man, dying on the cross, came to see him in all the
   infinite, untreated glories of the divine nature, manifesting
   themselves in his person, it could not but fill their souls with
   transcendent joy and admiration. And this is one reason of his prayer
   for them whilst he was on the earth, that they might be where he is to
   behold his glory; for he knew what ineffable satisfaction it would be
   unto them for evermore.
				</p><p>
   3. I do not understand absolutely the glorification of the human nature
   of Christ, -- that very soul and body wherein he lived and died,
   suffered and rose again, -- though that also be included herein. This
   also were a subject meet for our contemplation, especially as it is the
   exemplar of that glory which he will bring all those unto who believe
   in him. But because at present we look somewhat farther, I shall
   observe only one or two things concerning it.
				</p><p>
   (1.) That very nature itself which he took on him in this world, is
   exalted into glory. Some under a pretence of great subtlety and
   accuracy, do deny that he has either flesh or blood in heaven; that is,
   as to the substance of them, however you may suppose that they are
   changed, purified, glorified. The great foundation of the church and
   all gospel faith, is, that he was made flesh, that he did partake of
   flesh and blood, even as did the children. That he has forsaken that
   flesh and blood which he was made in the womb of the blessed Virgin, --
   wherein he lived and died, which he offered unto God in sacrifice, and
   wherein he rose from the dead, -- is a Socinian fiction. What is the
   true nature of the glorification of the humanity of Christ, neither
   those who thus surmise, nor we, can perfectly comprehend. It does not
   yet appear what we ourselves shall be; much less is it evident unto us
   what he is, whom we shall be like. But that he is still in the same
   human nature wherein he was on the earth, that he has the same rational
   soul and the same body, is a fundamental article of the Christian
   faith.
				</p><p>
   (2.) This nature of the man Christ Jesus is filled with all the divine
   graces and perfections whereof a limited, created nature is capable. It
   is not deified, it is not made a god; -- it does not in heaven coalesce
   into one nature with the divine by a composition of them, -- it has not
   any essential property of the Deity communicated unto it, so as
   subjectively to reside in it; -- it is not made omniscient,
   omnipresent, omnipotent; but it is exalted in a fulness of all Divine
   perfection ineffably above the glory of angels and men. It is
   incomprehensibly nearer God than they all, -- hath communications from
   God, in glorious light, love, and power, ineffably above them all; but
   it is still a creature.
				</p><p>
   For the substance of this glory of the human nature of Christ,
   believers shall be made partakers of it; for when we see him as he is,
   we shall be like him; but as unto the degrees and measures of it, his
   glory is above all that we can be made partakers of. "There is one
   glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
   stars; and one star differeth from another in glory," as the apostle
   speaks, <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.41">1 Corinthians 15:41</reference> And if there be a difference in glory among the
   stars themselves as to some degrees of the same glory, how much more is
   there between the glory of the sun and that of any star whatever! Such
   is the difference that is, and will be unto eternity, between the human
   nature of Christ and what glorified believers do attain unto. But yet
   this is not that properly wherein the glory of Christ in his
   exaltation, after his humiliation and death, does consist. The things
   that belong unto it may be reduced unto the ensuing heads.
				</p><p>
   1. It consisteth in the exaltation of the human nature, as subsisting
   in the divine person, above the whole creation of God in power,
   dignity, authority, and rule, with all things that the wisdom of God
   has appointed to render the glory of it illustrious. I have so largely
   insisted on the explication and confirmation of this part of the
   present glory of Christ, in the exposition of <reference osisRef="Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:2-3</reference>, that I have
   nothing more to add thereunto.
				</p><p>
   2. It does so in the evidence given of the infinite love of God the
   Father unto him, and his delight in him, with the eternal approbation
   of his discharge of the office committed unto him. Hence he is said "to
   sit at the right hand of God," or at "the right hand of the majesty on
   high." That the glory and dignity of Christ in his exaltation is
   singular, the highest that can be given to a creature,
   incomprehensible; -- that he is, with respect unto the discharge of his
   office, under the eternal approbation of God; -- that, as so gloriously
   exalted, he is proclaimed unto the whole creation, -- are all contained
   in this expression.
				</p><p>
   3. Hereunto is added the full manifestation of his own divine wisdom,
   love, and grace, in the work of mediation and redemption of the church.
   This glory is absolutely singular and peculiar unto him. Neither angels
   nor men have the least interest in it. Here, we see it darkly as in a
   glass; above, it shines forth in its brightness, to the eternal joy of
   them who behold him.
				</p><p>
   This is that glory which our Lord Jesus Christ in an especial manner
   prayed that his disciples might behold. This is that whereof we ought
   to endeavour a prospect by faith; -- by faith, I say, and not by
   imagination. Vain and foolish men, having general notions of this glory
   of Christ, knowing nothing of the real nature of it, have endeavoured
   to represent it in pictures and images, with all that lustre and beauty
   which the art of painting, with the ornaments of gold and jewels, can
   give unto them. This is that representation of the present glory of
   Christ, which, being made and proposed unto the imagination and carnal
   affections of superstitious persons, carrieth such a show of devotion
   and veneration in the Papal Church. But they err, not knowing the
   Scripture, nor the eternal glory of the Son of God.
				</p><p>
   This is the sole foundation of all our meditations herein. The glory
   that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the real actual possession of in
   heaven can be no otherwise seen or apprehended in this world, but in
   the light of faith fixing itself on divine revelation. To behold this
   glory of Christ is not an act of fancy or imagination. It does not
   consist in framing unto ourselves the shape of a glorious person in
   heaven. But the steady exercise of faith on the revelation and
   description made of this glory of Christ in the Scripture, is the
   ground, rule, and measure, of all divine meditations thereon.
				</p><p>
   Hereon our duty it is to call ourselves to an account as unto our
   endeavour after a gracious view of this glory of Christ:  When did we
   steadily behold it? when had we such a view of it as wherein our souls
   have been satisfied and refreshed? It is declared and represented unto
   us as one of the chief props of our faith, as a help of our joy, as an
   object of our hope, as a ground of our consolation, -- as our greatest
   encouragement unto obedience and suffering. Are our minds every day
   conversant with thoughts hereof? or do we think ourselves not much
   concerned herein? Do we look upon it as that which is without us and
   above us, -- that which we shall have time enough to consider when we
   come to heaven? So is it with many. They care neither where Christ is
   nor what he is, so that one way or other they may be saved by him. They
   hope, as they pretend, that they shall see him and his glory in heaven,
   -- and that they suppose to be time enough; but in vain do they pretend
   a desire thereof, -- in vain are their expectations of any such thing.
   They who endeavour not to behold the glory of Christ in this world, as
   has been often said, shall never behold him in glory hereafter unto
   their satisfaction; nor do they desire so to do, only they suppose it a
   part of that relief which they would have when they are gone out of
   this world. For what should beget such a desire in them? Nothing can do
   it but some view of it here by faith; which they despise, or totally
   neglect. Every pretence of a desire of heaven, and of the presence of
   Christ therein, that does not arise from, that is not resolved into,
   that prospect which we have of the glory of Christ in this world by
   faith, is mere fancy and imagination.
				</p><p>
   Our constant exercise in meditation on this glory of Christ will fill
   us with joy on his account; which is an effectual motive unto the duty
   itself. We are for the most part selfish, and look no farther than our
   own concernments. So we may be pardoned and saved by him, we care not
   much how it is with himself, but only presume it is well enough. We
   find not any concernment of our own therein. But this frame is directly
   opposite unto the genius of divine faith and love. For their principal
   actings consist in preferring Christ above ourselves, and our concerns
   in him above all our own. Let this, then, stir us up unto the
   contemplation of this glory. Who is it that is thus exalted over all?
   Who is thus encompassed with glory, majesty, and power? Who is it that
   sits down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, -- all his enemies
   being made his footstool? Is it not he who in this world was poor,
   despised, persecuted, and slain, -- all for our sakes? Is it not the
   same Jesus who loved us, and gave himself for us, and washed us in his
   own blood? So the apostle told the Jews that the same "Jesus whom they
   slew and hanged on a tree, God had exalted with his right hand to be a
   Prince and Saviour, to give repentance unto Israel, and the forgiveness
   of sins," <reference osisRef="Acts.5.30 Acts.5.31">Acts 5:30-31</reference> If we have any valuation of his love, if we
   have any concernment in what he has done and suffered for the church,
   we cannot but rejoice in his present state and glory.
				</p><p>
   Let the world rage whilst it pleaseth; let it set itself with all its
   power and craft against every thing of Christ that is in it, -- which,
   whatever is by some otherwise pretended, proceeds from a hatred unto
   his person; let men make themselves drunk with the blood of his saints;
   we have this to oppose unto all their attempts, unto our supportment,
   -- namely, what he says of himself: "Fear not; I am the first and the
   last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for
   evermore, and have the keys of hell and of death," <reference osisRef="Rev.1.17 Rev.1.18">Revelation of John 1:17-18</reference>
				</p><p>
   Blessed Jesus! we can add nothing to thee, nothing to thy glory; but it
   is a joy of heart unto us that thou art what thou art, -- that thou art
   so gloriously exalted at the right hand of God; and we do long more
   fully and clearly to behold that glory, according to thy prayer and
   promise.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 8 Representations of the glory of Christ under the Old Testament">
<title>Chapter 8 Representations of the glory of Christ under the Old Testament</title>
<p>   It is said of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, "beginning at Moses and all
   the prophets, he declared unto his disciples in all the Scriptures the
   things concerning himself," <reference osisRef="Luke.24.27">Luke 24:27</reference> It is therefore manifest
   that Moses, and the Prophets, and all the Scriptures, do give testimony
   unto him and his glory. This is the line of life and light which runs
   through the whole Old Testament; without the conduct whereof we can
   understand nothing aright therein: and the neglect hereof is that which
   makes many as blind in reading the books of it as are the Jews, -- the
   veil being upon their minds. It is faith alone, discovering the glory
   of Christ, that can remove that veil of darkness which covers the minds
   of men in reading the Old Testament, as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.14 2Cor.3.15 2Cor.3.16">2 Corinthians 3:14-16</reference> I shall, therefore, consider briefly some of those ways and
   means whereby the glory of Christ was represented unto believers under
   the Old Testament.
				</p><p>
   1. It was so in the institution of the beautiful worship of the law,
   with all the means of it. Herein have they the advantage above all the
   splendid ceremonies that men can invent in the outward worship of God;
   they were designed and framed in divine wisdom to represent the glory
   of Christ, in his person and his office. This nothing of human
   invention can do, or once pretend unto. Men cannot create mysteries,
   nor can give unto anything natural in itself a mystical signification.
   But so it was in the old divine institutions. What were the tabernacle
   and temple? What was the holy place with the utensil of it? What was
   the oracle, the ark, the cherubim, the mercy-seat, placed therein? What
   was the high priest in all his vestments and administrations? What were
   the sacrifices and annual sprinkling of blood in the most holy place?
   What was the whole system of their religious worship? Were they
   anything but representations of Christ in the glory of his person and
   his office? They were a shadow, and the body represented by that shadow
   was Christ. If any would see how the Lord Christ was in particular
   foresignified and represented in them, he may peruse our exposition on
   the 9^th chapter of the Epistle unto the Hebrews, where it is handled
   so at large as that I shall not here again insist upon it. The sum is,
   "Moses was faithful in all the house of God, for a testimony of those
   things which were to be spoken afterward," <reference osisRef="Heb.3.5">Hebrews 3:5</reference> All that Moses
   did in the erection of the tabernacle, and the institution of all its
   services, was but to give an antecedent testimony by way of
   representation, unto the things of Christ that were afterward to be
   revealed. And that also was the substance of the ministry of the
   prophets, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11 1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:11-12</reference> The dark apprehensions of the glory of
   Christ, which by these means they obtained, were the life of the church
   of old.
				</p><p>
   2. It was represented in the mystical account which is given us of his
   communion with his church in love and grace. As this is intimated in
   many places of Scripture, so there is one entire book designed unto its
   declaration. This is the divine Song of Solomon, who was a type of
   Christ, and a penman of the Holy Ghost therein. A gracious record it is
   of the divine communications of Christ in love and grace unto his
   church, with their returns of love unto him, and delight in him. And
   then may a man judge himself to have somewhat profited in the
   experience of the mystery of a blessed intercourse and communion with
   Christ, when the expressions of them in that holy dialogue do give
   light and life unto his mind, and efficaciously communicate unto him an
   experience of their power. But because these things are little
   understood by many, the book itself is much neglected, if not despised;
   yea, to such impudence have some arrived, in foaming out their own
   shame, as that they have ridiculed the expressions of it. But we are
   foretold of such mockers in the last days, that should walk after their
   own ungodly lusts; they are not of our present consideration.
				</p><p>
   The former instance of the representations of the glory of Christ in
   their institutions of outward worship, with this record of the inward
   communion they had with Christ in grace, faith, and love, gives us the
   substance of that view which they had of his glory. What holy strains
   of delight and admiration, what raptures of joy, what solemn and divine
   complacency, what ardency of affection, and diligence in attendance
   unto the means of enjoying communion with him, this discovery of the
   glory of Christ wrought in the souls of them that did believe, is
   emphatically expressed in that discourse. A few days, a few hours spent
   in the frame characterised in it, is a blessedness excelling all the
   treasures of the earth; and if we, whose revelations of the same glory
   do far exceed theirs, should be found to come short of them in ardency
   of affection unto Christ, and continual holy admiration of his
   excellencies, we shall one day be judged unworthy to have received
   them.
				</p><p>
   3. It was so represented and made known under the Old Testament, in his
   personal appearances on various occasions unto several eminent persons,
   leaders of the church in their generations This he did as a pr�ludium
   to his incarnation. He was as yet God only; but appeared in the assumed
   shape of a man, to signify what he would be. He did not create a human
   nature, and unite it unto himself for such a season; only by his divine
   power he acted the shape of a man composed of what ethereal substance
   he pleased, immediately to be dissolved. So he appeared to Abraham, to
   Jacob, to Moses, to Joshua, and others; as I have at large elsewhere
   proved and confirmed. And hereon, also, because he was the divine
   person who dwelt in and dwelt with the church, under the Old Testament,
   from first to last, in so doing he constantly assumes unto himself
   human affections, to intimate that a season would come when he would
   immediately act in that nature. And, indeed, after the fall there is
   nothing spoken of God in the Old Testament, nothing of his
   institutions, nothing of the way and manner of dealing with the church,
   but what has respect unto the future incarnation of Christ. And it had
   been absurd to bring in God under perpetual anthropopathies, as
   grieving, repenting, being angry, well pleased, and the like, were it
   not but that the divine person intended was to take on him the nature
   wherein such affections do dwell.
				</p><p>
   4. It was represented in prophetical visions. So the apostle affirms
   that the vision which Isaiah had of him was when he saw his glory, <reference osisRef="John.12.41">John 12:41</reference> And it was a blessed representation thereof; for his divine
   person being exalted on a throne of glory, "his train filled the
   temple." The whole train of his glorious grace filled the temple of his
   body. This is the true tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man; --
   the temple which was destroyed, and which he raised again in three
   days, wherein dwelt the fulness of the Godhead, <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference> This glory
   was now presented unto the view of Isaiah, chap. vi. 1-5; which filled
   him with dread and astonishment. But from thence he was relieved, by an
   act of the ministry of that glorious one, taking away his iniquity by a
   coal from the altar; which typified the purifying efficacy of his
   sacrifice. This was food for the souls of believers: in these and on
   the like occasions did the whole church lift up their voice in that
   holy cry, "Make haste, our Beloved, and be thou like to a roe, or to a
   young hart, on the mountains of spices."
				</p><p>
   Of the same nature was his glorious appearance on mount Sinai at the
   giving of the law, Exod. xix.; -- for the description thereof by the
   Psalmist, <reference osisRef="Ps.68.17 Ps.68.18">Psalms 68:17-18</reference>, is applied by the apostle unto the
   ascension of Christ after his resurrection, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.8">Ephesians 4:8</reference> Only, as it was
   then full of outward terror, because of the giving of the fiery law, it
   was referred unto by the Psalmist as full of mercy, with respect unto
   his accomplishment of the same law. His giving of it was as death unto
   them concerned, because of its holiness, and the severity of the curse
   wherewith it was attended; his fulfilling of it was life, by the pardon
   and righteousness which issued from thence.
				</p><p>
   5. The doctrine of his incarnation, whereby he became the subject of
   all that glory which we inquire after, was revealed, although not so
   clearly as by the Gospel, after the actual accomplishment of the thing
   itself. In how many places this is done in the Old Testament I have
   elsewhere declared; at least I have explained and vindicated many of
   them (for no man can presume to know them all), -- "Vindici�
   Evangelic�." [6] One instance, therefore, shall here suffice; and this
   is that of the same prophet Isaiah, chap. ix. 6, 7, "Unto us a child is
   born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his
   shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The
   mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the
   increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the
   throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it
   with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal
   of the Lord of hosts will perform this." This one testimony is
   sufficient to confound all Jews, Socinians, and other enemies of the
   glory of Christ. I do acknowledge that, notwithstanding this
   declaration of the glory of Christ in his future incarnation and rule,
   there remained much darkness in the minds of them unto whom it was then
   made. For although they might and did acquiesce in the truth of the
   revelation, yet they could frame to themselves no notions of the way or
   manner of its accomplishment. But now, when every word of it is
   explained, declared, and its mystical sense visibly laid open unto us
   in the Gospel, and by the accomplishment exactly answering every
   expression in it, it is judicial blindness not to receive it. Nothing
   but the satanical pride of the hearts of men, which will admit of no
   effects of infinite wisdom but what they suppose they can comprehend,
   can shut their eyes against the light of this truth.
				</p><p>
   6. Promises, prophecies, predictions, concerning his person, his
   coming, his office, his kingdom, and his glory in them all, with the
   wisdom, grace, and love of God to the church in him, are the line of
   life, as was said, which runs through all the writings of the Old
   Testament, and takes up a great portion of them. Those were the things
   which he expounded unto his disciples out of Moses and all the
   Prophets. Concerning these things he appealed to the Scriptures against
   all his adversaries: "Search the Scriptures; for they are they which
   testify of me." And if we find them not, if we discern them not
   therein, it is because a veil of blindness is over our minds. Nor can
   we read, study, or meditate on the writings of the Old Testament unto
   any advantage, unless we design to find out and behold the glory of
   Christ, declared and represented in them. For want hereof they are a
   sealed book to many unto this day.
				</p><p>
   7. It is usual in the Old Testament to set out the glory of Christ
   under metaphorical expressions; yea, it aboundeth therein. For such
   allusions are exceedingly suited to let in a sense into our minds of
   those things which we cannot distinctly comprehend. And there is an
   infinite condescension of divine wisdom in this way of instruction,
   representing unto us the power of things spiritual in what we naturally
   discern. Instances of this kind, in calling the Lord Christ by the
   names of those creatures which unto our senses represent that
   excellency which is spiritually in him, are innumerable. So he is
   called the rose, for the sweet savour of his love, grace, and
   obedience; -- the lily, for his gracious beauty and amiableness; -- the
   pearl of great price, for his worth, for to them that believe he is
   precious; -- the vine, for his fruitfulness; -- the lion, for his
   power; -- the lamb, for his meekness and fitness for sacrifice; with
   other things of the like kind almost innumerable.
				</p><p>
   These things have I mentioned, not with any design to search into the
   depth of this treasury of those divine truths concerning the glory of
   Christ: but only to give a little light unto the words of the
   evangelist, that he opened unto his disciples out of Moses and all the
   Prophets the things which concerned himself; and to stir up our own
   souls unto a contemplation of them as contained therein.

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 9 The glory of Christ in his intimate conjunction with the church">
<title>Chapter 9 The glory of Christ in his intimate conjunction with the church</title>
<p>   What concerns the glory of Christ in the mission of the Holy Ghost unto
   the church, with all the divine truths that are branched from it, I
   have at large declared in my discourse concerning the whole
   dispensation of the Holy Spirit. Here, therefore, it must have no place
   amongst those many other things which offer themselves unto our
   contemplation as part of this glory, or intimately belonging thereunto.
   I shall insist briefly on three only, which cannot be reduced directly
   unto the former heads.
				</p><p>
   And the first of these is, -- That intimate conjunction that is between
   Christ and the church; whence it is just and equal in the sight of God,
   according unto the rules of his eternal righteousness, that what he did
   and suffered in the discharge of his office, should be esteemed,
   reckoned, and imputed unto us, as unto all the fruits and benefits of
   it, as if we had done and suffered the same things ourselves. For this
   conjunction of his with us was an act of his own mind and will, wherein
   he is ineffably glorious.
				</p><p>
   The enemies of the glory of Christ and of his cross do take this for
   granted, that there ought to be such a conjunction between the guilty
   person and him that suffers for him, as that in him the guilty person
   may be said, in some sense, to undergo the punishment himself. But then
   they affirm, on the other hand, that there was no such conjunction
   between Christ and sinners, -- none at all; but that he was a man, as
   they were men; and otherwise, that he was at the greatest distance from
   them all as it is possible for one man to be from another, Socin. de
   Servat. lib. iii. cap. 3. The falseness of this latter assertion, and
   the gross ignorance of the Scripture, under a pretence of subtlety, in
   them that make it, will evidently appear in our ensuing Discourse.
				</p><p>
   The apostle tells us, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.24">1 Peter 2:24</reference>, that in "his own self he bare our
   sins in his own body on the tree;" and, chap. iii. 18, that he
   "suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to
   God." But this seems somewhat strange unto reason. Where is the
   justice, where is the equity, that the just should suffer for the
   unjust? Where is divine righteousness herein? For it was an act of God:
   "The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.6">Isaiah 53:6</reference> The
   equity hereof, with the grounds of it, must be here a little inquired
   into.
				</p><p>
   First of all, it is certain that all the elect, the whole church of
   God, fell in Adam under the curse due to the transgression of the law.
   It is so also, that in this curse death, both temporal and eternal, was
   contained. This curse none could undergo and be saved. Nor was it
   consistent with the righteousness, or holiness, or truth of God, that
   sin should go unpunished. Wherefore there was a necessity, upon a
   supposition of God's decree to save his church, of a translation of
   punishment, -- namely, from them who had deserved it, and could not
   bear it, unto one who had not deserved it, but could bear it.
				</p><p>
   A supposition of this translation of punishment by divine dispensation
   is the foundation of Christian religion, yea, of all supernatural
   revelation contained in the Scripture. This was first intimated in the
   first promise; and afterward explained and confirmed in all the
   institutions of the Old Testament. For although in the sacrifices of
   the law, there was a revival of the greatest and most fundamental
   principle of the law of nature, -- namely, that God is to be worshipped
   with our best, -- yet the principal end and use of them was to
   represent this translation of punishment from the offender unto
   another, who was to be a sacrifice in his stead.
				</p><p>
   The reasons of the equity hereof, and the unspeakable glory of Christ
   herein, is what we now inquire into. And I shall reduce what ought to
   be spoken hereunto to the ensuing heads: 
				</p><p>
   I. It is not contrary unto the nature of divine justice, it does not
   interfere with the principles of natural light in man, that in sundry
   cases some persons should suffer punishment for the sins and offences
   of others.
				</p><p>
   I shall at present give this assertion no other confirmation, but only
   that God has often done so, who will, who can, do no iniquity.
				</p><p>
   So he affirms that he will do, <reference osisRef="Exod.20.5">Exodus 20:5</reference>, "Visiting the iniquity of
   the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation." It
   is no exception of weight, that they also are sinners, continuing in
   their fathers' sins; for the worst of sinners must not be dealt
   unjustly withal: but they must be so if they are punished for their
   fathers' sins, and it be absolutely unlawful that any one should be
   punished for the sin of another.
				</p><p>
   So the church affirms, "Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we
   have borne their iniquities," <reference osisRef="Lam.5.7">Lamentations 5:7</reference> And so it was; for in the
   Babylonish captivity God punished the sins of their forefathers,
   especially those committed in the days of Manasseh, <reference osisRef="2Kgs.23.26 2Kgs.23.27">2 Kings 23:26-27</reference>; as afterward, in the final destruction of that church and nation,
   God punished in them the guilt of all bloody persecutions from the
   beginning of the world, <reference osisRef="Luke.11.50 Luke.11.51">Luke 11:50-51</reference>
				</p><p>
   So Canaan was cursed for the sin of his father, <reference osisRef="Gen.9.25">Genesis 9:25</reference> Saul's
   seven sons were put to death for their father's bloody cruelty, <reference osisRef="2Sam.21.9 2Sam.21.14">2 Samuel 21:9, 14</reference> For the sin of David, seventy thousand of the people were
   destroyed by an angel, concerning whom he said, "It is I that have
   sinned and done evil; these sheep, what have they done?" <reference osisRef="2Sam.24.15 2Sam.24.16 2Sam.24.17">2 Samuel 24:15-17</reference> See also <reference osisRef="1Kgs.21.29">1 Kings 21:29</reference> So was it with all the children or
   infantry that perished in the flood, or in the conflagration of Sodom
   and Gomorrah. And other instances of the like nature may be assigned.
				</p><p>
   It is therefore evident that there is no inconsistency with the nature
   of divine justice, nor the rules of reason among men, that in sundry
   cases the sins of some may be punished on others.
				</p><p>
   II. It is to be observed, that this administration of justice is not
   promiscuous, -- that any whatever may be punished for the sins of any
   others. There is always a special cause and reason of it; and this is a
   peculiar conjunction between them who sin and those who are punished
   for their sins. And two things belong unto this conjunction. 1.
   Especial relation; 2. Especial mutual interest.
				</p><p>
   1. There is an especial relation required unto this translation of
   punishment; such as that between parents and children, as in most of
   the instances before given; or between a king and subjects, as in the
   case of David. Hereby the persons sinning and those suffering are
   constituted one body, wherein if one member offend, another may justly
   suffer: the back may answer for what the hand takes away.
				</p><p>
   2. It consists in mutual interest. Those whose sins are punished in
   others have such an interest in them, as that their being so is a
   punishment unto themselves. Therefore are such sinners threatened with
   the punishment and evils that shall befall their posterity or children
   for their sakes; which is highly penal unto themselves, <reference osisRef="Num.14.33">Numbers 14:33</reference>,
   "Your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear
   your whoredoms." The punishment due to their sins is in part
   transferred unto their children; and therein did the sting of their own
   punishment also consist.
				</p><p>
   III. There is a greater, a more intimate conjunction, a nearer
   relation, a higher mutual interest, between Christ and the church, than
   ever was or can be between any other persons or relations in the world,
   whereon it became just and equal in the sight of God that he should
   suffer for us, and that what he did and suffered would be imputed unto
   us; which is farther to be cleared.
				</p><p>
   There neither is nor can be any more than a threefold conjunction
   between divers distinct persons. The first is natural; the second is
   moral, whereunto I refer that which is spiritual or mystical; and the
   third federal, by virtue of mutual compact. In all thee ways is Christ
   in conjunction with his church, and in every one of them in a way
   singular and peculiar.
				</p><p>
   1. The first conjunction of distinct periods is natural. God has made
   all mankind "of one blood," <reference osisRef="Acts.17.26">Acts 17:26</reference>, -- whereby there is a
   cognation and alliance between them all. Hence every man is every man's
   brother or neighbour, unto whom loving-kindness is to be showed, <reference osisRef="Luke.10.36">Luke 10:36</reference> And this conjunction was between Christ and the church, as the
   apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.15">Hebrews 2:14-15</reference>, "Forasmuch then as the children are
   partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the
   same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death
   were all their lifetime subject to bondage." Hence "both he that
   sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one," verse 11. His
   infinite condescension, in coming into this communion and conjunction
   of nature with us, was before declared; but it is not common, like that
   between all other men, partakers of the same nature. There are two
   things wherein it was peculiar and eminent.
				</p><p>
   (1.) This conjunction between him and the church did not arise from a
   necessity of nature, but from a voluntary act of his will. The
   conjunction that is between all others is necessary. Every man is every
   man's brother, Whether he will or no, by being a man. Natural
   generation, communicating to every one his subsistence in the same
   nature, prevents all acts of their own will and choice. With the Lord
   Christ it was otherwise, as the text affirms. For such reasons as are
   there expressed, he did, by an act of his own will, partake of flesh
   and blood, or came into this conjunction with us. He did it of his own
   choice, because the children did partake of the same. He would be what
   the children were. Wherefore the conjunction of Christ in human nature
   with the church is ineffably distinct from that common conjunction
   which is amongst all others in the same nature. And, therefore,
   although it should not be meet amongst mere men, that one should act
   and suffer in the stead of others, because they are all thus related to
   one another, as it were, whether they will or no; yet this could not
   reach the Lord Christ, who, in a strange and wonderful manner, came
   into this conjunction by a mere act of his own.
				</p><p>
   (2.) He came into it on this design, and for this only end, -- namely,
   that in our nature, taken to be his own, he might do and suffer what
   was to be done and suffered for the church: so it is added in the text,
   "That by death he might destroy him who had the power of death; and
   deliver them who through fear of death were subject to bondage." This
   was the only end of his conjunction in nature with the church; and this
   puts the case between him and it at a vast distance from what is or may
   be between other men.
				</p><p>
   It is a foolish thing to argue, that because a mere participation of
   the same nature among men is not sufficient to warrant the
   righteousness of punishing one for another, -- therefore the
   conjunction in the same nature betwixt Christ and the church is not a
   sufficient and just foundation of his suffering for us, and in our
   stead. For, by an act of his own will and choice, he did partake of our
   nature, and that for this very end, that therein he might suffer for
   us; as the Holy Ghost expressly declares. Amongst others, there neither
   is nor can be any thing of this nature, and so no objection from what
   is equal or unequal amongst them can arise against what is equal
   between Christ and the church. And herein is he glorious and precious
   unto them that believe, as we shall see immediately.
				</p><p>
   2. There is a mystical conjunction between Christ and the church, which
   answers all the most strict, real, or moral unions or conjunctions
   between other persons or things. Such is the conjunction between the
   head of a body and its members, or the tree of the vine and its
   branches, which are real; or between a husband and wife, which is moral
   and real also. That there is such a conjunction between Christ and his
   church the Scripture plentifully declares, as also that it is the
   foundation of the equity of his suffering in its stead. So speaks the
   apostle, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25 Eph.5.26 Eph.5.27 Eph.5.28 Eph.5.29 Eph.5.30 Eph.5.31 Eph.5.32">Ephesians 5:25-32</reference>, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also
   loved the church," -- that is, his wife, the bride, the Lamb's wife, --
   "and gave himself for it," etc.. Being the head and husband of the
   church, which was to be sanctified and saved, and could be so no
   otherwise but by his blood and sufferings, he was both meet so to
   suffer, and it was righteous also that what he did and suffered should
   be imputed unto them for whom he both did it and suffered. Let the
   adversaries of the glory of Christ assign any one instance of such a
   conjunction, union, and relation between any amongst mankind, as is
   between Christ and the church, and they may give some countenance unto
   their cavils against his obedience and sufferings in our stead, with
   the imputation of what he did and suffered unto us. But the glory of
   Christ is singular herein, and as such it appears unto them by whom the
   mystery of it is, in any measure, spiritually apprehended.
				</p><p>
   But yet it will be said, that this mystical conjunction of Christ with
   his church is consequential unto what he did and suffered for it; for
   it ensues on the conversion of men unto him. For it is by faith that we
   are implanted into him. Until that be actually wrought in us, we have
   no mystical conjunction with him. He is not a head or a husband unto
   unregenerate, unsanctified unbelievers, whilst they continue so to be;
   and such was the state of the whole church when Christ suffered for us,
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.8">Romans 5:8</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.2.5">Ephesians 2:5</reference> There was, therefore, no such mystical
   conjunction between him and the church as to render it meet and equal
   that he should suffer in its stead. Wherefore the church is the effect
   of the work of redemption, -- that which rose out of it, which was made
   and constituted by it; and cannot be so the object of it as that which
   was to be redeemed by virtue of an antecedent conjunction with it. I
   answer, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) Although this mystical conjunction is not actually consummate
   without an actual participation of the Spirit of Christ, yet the church
   of the elect was designed antecedently unto all his sufferings to be
   his spouse and wife, so as that he might love her and suffer for her;
   so it is said, <reference osisRef="Hos.12.12">Hosea 12:12</reference>, "Israel served for a wife, and for a wife
   he kept sheep." Howbeit she was not his married wife until after he had
   served for her, and thereby purchased her to be his wife; yet as he
   served for her she is called his wife, because of his love unto her,
   and because she was so designed to be, upon his service. So was the
   church designed to be the spouse of Christ in the counsel of God;
   whereon he loved her and gave himself for her.
				</p><p>
   Hence, in the work of redemption the church was the object of it, as
   designed to be the spouse of Christ; and the effect of it, inasmuch as
   that thereby it was made meet for the full consummation of that
   alliance; as the apostle expressly declares, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25 Eph.5.26 Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:25-27</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) Antecedently unto all that the Lord Christ did and suffered for
   the church, there was a supreme act of the will of God the Father,
   giving all the elect unto him, intrusting them with him, to be
   redeemed, sanctified, and saved; as himself declares, <reference osisRef="John.17.6 John.17.9">John 17:6, 9</reference>;
   x. 14-16. And on these grounds this mystical conjunction between Christ
   and the church has its virtue and efficacy before it be actually
   consummate.
				</p><p>
   3. There is a federal conjunction between distinct persons: and as this
   is various, according unto the variety of the interests and ends of
   them that enter into it; so that is most eminent, where one, by the
   common consent of all that are concerned, undertakes to be a sponsor or
   surety for others, to do and answer what on their part is required of
   them for attaining the ends of the covenant. So did the Lord Christ
   undertake to be surety of the new covenant in behalf of the church,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.7.22">Hebrews 7:22</reference>, and thereon tendered himself unto God, to do and suffer
   for them, in their stead, and on their behalf, whatever was required,
   that they might be sanctified and saved. These things I have treated of
   at large elsewhere, as containing a great part of the mystery of the
   wisdom of God in the salvation of the church. Here, therefore, I do
   only observe, that this is that whereby the mystical conjunction that
   was between Christ and the church, whereon it was meet, just, and equal
   in the sight of God, that what he did and suffered should be imputed
   unto us, is completed.
				</p><p>
   These are some of the foundations of that mystery of transmitting the
   sins of the church, as to the guilt and punishment of them, from the
   sinners themselves unto another, every way innocent, pure, and
   righteous in himself, -- which is the life, soul, and centre of all
   Scripture revelations. And herein is he exceedingly glorious and
   precious unto them that believe. No heart can conceive, no tongue can
   express the glory of Christ herein. Now, because his infinite
   condescension and love herein have been spoken to before, I shall here
   only instance its greatness in some of its effects.
				</p><p>
   1. It shines forth in the exaltation of the righteousness of God in the
   forgiveness of sins. There is no more adequate conception of the divine
   nature, than that of justice in rule and government. Hereunto it
   belongs to punish sin according unto its desert; and herein consisted
   the first actings of God as the governor of the rational creation. They
   did so in the eternal punishment of the angels that sinned, and the
   casting of Adam out of Paradise, -- an emblem also of everlasting ruin.
   Now, all the church, all the elect of God, are sinners; -- they were so
   in Adam, -- they have been and are so in themselves. What does become
   the justice of God to do thereon? Shall it dismiss them all unpunished?
   Where, then, is that justice which spared not the angels who sinned,
   nor Adam at the first? Would this procedure have any consonance
   thereunto, -- be reconcilable unto it? Wherefore the establishment of
   the righteousness of God on the one hand, and the forgiveness of sin on
   the other, seem so contradictory, as that many stumble and fall at it
   eternally. See <reference osisRef="Rom.10.3 Rom.10.4">Romans 10:3-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   But in this interposition of Christ, in this translation of punishment
   from the church unto him, by virtue of his conjunction therewith, there
   is a blessed harmony between the righteousness of God and the
   forgiveness of sins; -- the exemplification whereof is his eternal
   glory. "O blessed change! O sweet permutation!" as Justin Martyr
   speaks.
				</p><p>
   By virtue of his union with the church, which of his own accord he
   entered into, and his undertaking therein to answer for it in the sight
   of God, it was a righteous thing with God to lay the punishment of all
   our sins upon him, so as that he might freely and graciously pardon
   them all, to the honour and exaltation of his justice, as well as of
   his grace and mercy, <reference osisRef="Rom.3.24 Rom.3.25 Rom.3.26">Romans 3:24-26</reference>
				</p><p>
   Herein is he glorious in the sight of God, angels, and men. In him
   there is at the same time, in the same divine acting, a glorious
   resplendence of justice and mercy; -- of the one in punishing, of the
   other in pardoning. The appearing inconsistency between the
   righteousness of God and the salvation of sinners, wherewith the
   consciences of convinced persons are exercised and terrified, and which
   is the rock on which most of them split themselves into eternal ruin,
   is herein removed and taken away. In his cross were divine holiness and
   vindictive justice exercised and manifested; and through his triumph,
   grace and mercy are exerted to the utmost. This is that glory which
   ravisheth the hearts and satiates the souls of them that believe. For
   what can they desire more, what is farther needful unto the rest and
   composure of their souls, than at one view to behold God eternally well
   pleased in the declaration of his righteousness and the exercise of his
   mercy, in order unto their salvation? In due apprehensions hereof let
   my soul live; -- in the faith hereof let me die, and let present
   admiration of this glory make way for the eternal enjoyment of it in
   its beauty and fulness.
				</p><p>
   2. He is glorious in that the law of God in its preceptive part, or as
   to the obedience which it required, was perfectly fulfilled and
   accomplished. That it should be so, was absolutely necessary, from the
   wisdom, holiness, and righteousness of him by whom it was given. For
   what could be more remote from those divine perfections, than to give a
   law which never was to be fulfilled in them unto whom it was given, and
   who were to have the advantages of it? This could not be done by us;
   but through the obedience of Christ, by virtue of this his mystical
   conjunction with the church, the law was so fulfilled in us by being
   fulfilled for us, as that the glory of God in the giving of it, and
   annexing eternal rewards unto it, is exceedingly exalted. See <reference osisRef="Rom.8.3 Rom.8.4">Romans 8:3-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   This is that glory of Christ whereof one view by faith will scatter all
   the fear, answer all the objections, and give relief against all the
   despondencies, of poor, tempted, doubting souls; and an anchor it will
   be unto all believers, which they may cast within the veil, to hold
   them firm and steadfast in all trials, storms, and temptations in life
   and death.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 10 The glory of Christ in the communication of himself unto believers">
<title>Chapter 10 The glory of Christ in the communication of himself unto believers</title>
<p>   Another instance of the glory of Christ, which we are to behold here by
   faith, and hope that we shall do so by sight hereafter, consists in the
   mysterious communication of himself, and all the benefits of his
   mediation, unto the souls of them that do believe, to their present
   happiness and future eternal blessedness.
				</p><p>
   Hereby he becomes theirs as they are his; which is the life, the glory,
   and consolation of the church, <reference osisRef="Song.6.3">Song of Solomon 6:3</reference>; ii. 16; vii. 10, -- he and
   all that he is being appropriated unto them, by virtue of their
   mystical union. There is, there must be, some ground, formal reason,
   and cause of this relation between Christ and the church, whereby he is
   theirs, and they are his; -- he is in them, and they in him, so as it
   is not between him and other men in the world.
				</p><p>
   The apostle, speaking of this communication of Christ unto the church,
   and the union between them which does ensue thereon, affirms that it is
   "a great mystery;" for "I speak," saith he, "concerning Christ and the
   church," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.32">Ephesians 5:32</reference>
				</p><p>
   I shall very briefly inquire into the causes, ways, and means of this
   mysterious communication, whereby he is made to be ours, to be in us,
   to dwell with us, and all the benefits of his mediation to belong unto
   us. For, as was said, it is evident that he does not thus communicate
   himself unto all by natural necessity, as the sun gives light equally
   unto the whole world, -- nor is he present with all by a ubiquity of
   his human nature, -- nor, as some dream, by a diffusion of his rational
   soul into all, -- nor does he become ours by a carnal eating of him in
   the sacrament; but this mystery proceeds from, and depends on, other
   reasons and causes, as we shall briefly declare.
				</p><p>
   But yet, before I proceed to declare the way and manner whereby Christ
   communicateth himself unto the church, I must premise something of
   divine communications in general and their glory. And I shall do this
   by touching a little on the harmony and correspondence that is between
   the old creation and the new.
				</p><p>
   1. All being, power, goodness, and wisdom, were originally essentially,
   infinitely in God. And in them, with the other perfections of his
   nature, consisted his essential glory.
				</p><p>
   2. The old creation was a communication of being and goodness by
   almighty power, directed by infinite wisdom, unto all things that were
   created for the manifestation of that glory. This was the first
   communication of God unto anything without himself; and it was
   exceeding glorious. See <reference osisRef="Ps.19.1">Psalms 19:1</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.1.20">Romans 1:20</reference> And it was a curious
   machine, framed in the subordination and dependency of one thing on
   another; without which they could not subsist, nor have a continuance
   of their beings. All creatures below live on the earth and the products
   of it; the earth, for its whole production, depends on the sun and
   other heavenly bodies; as God declares, <reference osisRef="Hos.2.21 Hos.2.22">Hosea 2:21-22</reference>, "I will hear,
   saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;
   and the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they
   shall hear Jezreel." God has given a subordination of things in a
   concatenation of causes, whereon their subsistence does depend. Yet, --
				</p><p>
   3. In this mutual dependency on and supplies unto one another, they all
   depend on and are influenced from God himself, -- the eternal fountain
   of being, power, and goodness. "He hears the heavens;" and in the
   continuation of this order, by constant divine communication of being,
   goodness, and power, unto all things, God is no less glorified than in
   the first creation of them, <reference osisRef="Acts.14.15 Acts.14.16 Acts.14.17">Acts 14:15-17</reference>; xvii. 24-29.
				</p><p>
   4. This glory of God is visible in the matter of it, and is obvious
   unto the reason of mankind; for from his works of creation and
   providence they may learn his eternal power and godhead, wherein he is
   essentially glorious.
				</p><p>
   5. But by this divine communication, God did not intend only to glorify
   himself in the essential properties of his nature, but his existence
   also in three persons, of Father, Son, and Spirit. For although the
   whole creation in its first framing, and in its perfection, was, and
   is, by an emanation of power and goodness from the divine nature, in
   the person of the Father, as he is the fountain of the Trinity, whence
   he is said peculiarly to be the Creator of all things; yet the
   immediate operation in the creation was from the Son, the power and
   wisdom of the Father, <reference osisRef="John.1.1 John.1.2 John.1.3">John 1:1-3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.1.16">Colossians 1:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.2">Hebrews 1:2</reference> And as upon
   the first production of the mass of the creation, it was under the
   especial care of the Spirit of God, to preserve and cherish it unto the
   production of all distinct sorts of creatures, <reference osisRef="Gen.1.2">Genesis 1:2</reference>, -- so in the
   continuance of the whole, there is an especial operation of the same
   Spirit in all things. Nothing can subsist one moment by virtue of the
   dependence which all things have on one another, without a continual
   emanation of power from him. See <reference osisRef="Ps.104.29 Ps.104.30">Psalms 104:29-30</reference>
				</p><p>
   By these divine communications, in the production and preservation of
   the creature, does God manifest his glory, and by them alone in the way
   of nature he does so; and without them, although he would have been for
   ever essentially glorious, yet was it impossible that his glory should
   be known unto any but himself. Wherefore, on these divine
   communications does depend the whole manifestation of the glory of God.
   But this is far more eminent, though not in the outward effects of it
   so visible, in the new creation; as we shall see.
				</p><p>
   1. All goodness, grace, life, light, mercy, and power, which are the
   springs and causes of the new creation, are all originally in God, in
   the divine nature, and that infinitely and essentially. In them is God
   eternally or essentially glorious; and the whole design of the new
   creation was to manifest his glory in them, by external communications
   of them, and from them.
				</p><p>
   2. The first communication of and from these things is made unto
   Christ, as the Head of the church. For, in the first place, it pleased
   God that in him should all the fulness of these things dwell, so as
   that the whole new creation might consist in him, <reference osisRef="Col.1.17 Col.1.18 Col.1.19">Colossians 1:17-19</reference> And
   this was the first egress of divine wisdom for the manifestation of the
   glory of God in these holy properties of his nature. For, --
				</p><p>
   3. This communication was made unto him as a repository and treasury of
   all that goodness, grace, life, light, power, and mercy, which were
   necessary for the constitution and preservation of the new creation.
   They were to be laid up in him, to be hid in him, to dwell in him; and
   from him to be communicated unto the whole mystical body designed unto
   him, -- that is, the church. And this is the first emanation of divine
   power and wisdom, for the manifestation of his glory in the new
   creation. This constitution of Christ as the head of it, and the
   treasuring up in him all that was necessary for its production and
   preservation, wherein the church is chosen and preordained in him unto
   grace and glory, is the spring and fountain of divine glory, in the
   communications that ensue thereon.
				</p><p>
   4. This communication unto Christ is, (1.) Unto his person; and then,
   (2.) With respect unto his office. It is in the person of Christ that
   all fulness does originally dwell. On the assumption of human nature
   into personal union with the Son of God, all fulness dwells in him
   bodily, <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference> And thereon receiving the Spirit in all fulness,
   and not by measure, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge were hid
   in him, <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference>, and he was filled with the unsearchable riches of
   divine grace, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.8 Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10 Eph.3.11">Ephesians 3:8-11</reference> And the office of Christ is nothing but
   the way appointed in the wisdom of God for the communication of the
   treasures of grace which were communicated unto his person. This is the
   end of the whole office of Christ, in all the parts of it, as he is a
   priest, a prophet, and a king. They are, I say, nothing but the ways
   appointed by infinite wisdom for the communication of the grace laid up
   in his person unto the church. The transcendent glory hereof we have in
   some weak measure inquired into.
				</p><p>
   5. The decree of election prepared, if I may so say, the mass of the
   new creation. In the old creation, God first prepared and created the
   mass or matter of the whole; which afterward, by the power of the Holy
   Spirit, was formed into all the distinct beings whereof the whole
   creation was to consist, and animates according to their distinct
   kinds.
				</p><p>
   And in order unto the production and perfecting of the work of the new
   creation, God did from eternity, in the holy purpose of his will,
   prepare, and in design set apart unto himself, that portion of mankind
   whereof it was to consist. Hereby they were only the peculiar matter
   that was to be wrought upon by the Holy Ghost, and the glorious fabric
   of the church erected out of it. What was said, it may be, of the
   natural body by the Psalmist, is true of the mystical body of Christ,
   which is principally intended, <reference osisRef="Ps.139.15 Ps.139.16">Psalms 139:15-16</reference>, "My substance was
   not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in
   the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance yet
   being imperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them." The
   substance of the church, whereof it was to be formed, was under the eye
   of God, as proposed in the decree of election; yet was it as such
   imperfect. It was not formed or shaped into members of the mystical
   body; but they were all written in the book of life. And in pursuance
   of the purpose of God, there they are by the Holy Spirit, in the whole
   course and continuance of time, in their several generations fashioned
   into the shape designed for them.
				</p><p>
   6. This, therefore, is herein the glorious order of divine
   communications. From the infinite, eternal spring of wisdom, grace,
   goodness and love, in the Father, -- all the effects whereof unto this
   end were treasured up in the person and mediation of the Son, -- the
   Holy Spirit, unto whom the actual application of them is committed,
   communicates life, light, power, grace, and mercy, unto all that are
   designed parts of the new creation. Hereon does God glorify both the
   essential properties of his nature, -- his infinite wisdom, power,
   goodness, and grace, -- as the only eternal spring of all these things,
   and also his ineffable glorious existence in three persons by the order
   of the communication of these things unto the church, which are
   originally from his nature. And herein is the glorious truth of the
   blessed Trinity, -- which by some is opposed, by some neglected, by
   most looked on as that which is so much above them as that it does not
   belong unto them, -- made precious unto them that believe, and becomes
   the foundation of their faith and hope. In a view of the glorious order
   of those divine communications, we are in a steady contemplation of the
   ineffable glory of the existence of the nature of God in the three
   distinct persons of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   7. According unto this divine order, the elect in all ages are, by the
   Holy Spirit moving and acting on that mass of the new creation, formed
   and animated with spiritual life, light, grace, and power, unto the
   glory of God. They are not called accidentally, according unto the
   external occasions and causes of their conversion unto God; but in
   every age, at his own time and season, the Holy Spirit communicates
   these things unto them in the order declared, unto the glory of God.
				</p><p>
   8. And in the same manner is the whole new creation preserved every
   day; -- every moment there is vital power and strength, mercy and
   grace, communicated in this divine order to all believers in the world.
   There is a continual influence from the Fountain, from the Head, into
   all the members, whereby they all consist in him, are acted by him, who
   worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good pleasure. And the
   apostle declares that the whole constitution of church order is suited,
   as an external instrument, to promote these divine communications unto
   all the members of the church itself, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.13 Eph.4.14 Eph.4.15">Ephesians 4:13-15</reference>
				</p><p>
   This in general is the order of divine communications, which is for the
   substance of it continued in heaven, and shall be so unto eternity; for
   God is, and ever will be, all, and in all. But at present it is
   invisible unto eyes of flesh, yea, the reason of men. Hence it is by
   the most despised; -- they see no glory in it. But let us consider the
   prayer of the apostle, that it may be otherwise with us, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.16 Eph.1.17 Eph.1.18 Eph.1.19 Eph.1.20 Eph.1.21 Eph.1.22 Eph.1.23">Ephesians 1:16-23</reference>
   For the revelation made of the glory of God in the old creation is
   exceeding inferior to that which he makes of himself in the new.
				</p><p>
   Having premised these things in general concerning the glory of divine
   communications, I shall proceed to declare, in particular, the grounds
   and way whereby the Lord Christ communicates himself and wherewithal
   all the benefits of his mediation, unto them that do believe, as it was
   before proposed.
				</p><p>
   We on our part are said herein to receive him, and that by faith, <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference> Now, where he is received by us, he must be tendered, given,
   granted, or communicated unto us. And this he is by some divine acts of
   the Father, and some of his own.
				</p><p>
   The foundation of the whole is laid in a sovereign act of the will, the
   pleasure, the grace of the Father. And this is the order and method of
   all divine operations in the way and work of grace. They originally
   proceed all from him; and having effected their ends, do return, rest,
   and centre in him again. See <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4 Eph.1.5 Eph.1.6">Ephesians 1:4-6</reference> Wherefore, that Christ is
   made ours, that he is communicated unto us, is originally from the free
   act, grant, and donation, of the Father, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.5.15 Rom.5.16 Rom.5.17">Romans 5:15-17</reference>
   And hereunto sundry things do concur. As, -- 1. His eternal purpose,
   which he purposed in himself, to glorify his grace in all his elect, by
   this communication of Christ and the benefits of his mediation unto
   them; which the apostle declares at large, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.2">Ephesians 1:2</reference> His granting all
   the elect unto Christ, to be his own, so to do and suffer for them what
   was antecedaneously necessary unto the actual communication of himself
   unto them: "Thine they were, and thou gavest them me," <reference osisRef="John.17.6">John 17:6</reference> 3.
   The giving of the promise, or the constitution of the rule and law of
   the Gospel, whereby a participation of Christ, an interest in him and
   all that he is, is made over and assured unto believers, <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.1.1 1John.1.2 1John.1.3 1John.1.4">1 John 1:1-4</reference> 4. An act of almighty power, working and creating faith in
   the souls of the elect, enabling them to receive Christ so exhibited
   and communicated unto them by the Gospel, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.19 Eph.1.20">Ephesians 1:19-20</reference>; ii. 5-8.
				</p><p>
   These things, which I have but named, have an influence into the glory
   of Christ herein; for this communication of him unto the church is an
   effect of the eternal counsel, wisdom, grace, and power of the Father.
				</p><p>
   But they are the acts of Christ himself herein, which principally we
   inquire into, as those which manifest the glory of his wisdom, love,
   and condescension.
				</p><p>
   And, -- 1. He gives and communicates unto them his Holy Spirit; -- the
   Holy Spirit as peculiarly his, as granted unto him of the Father, as
   inhabiting in him in all fulness. This Spirit -- abiding originally as
   to his person, and immeasurably as unto his effects and operations, in
   himself -- he gives unto all believers, to inhabit and abide in them
   also, <reference osisRef="John.14.14 John.14.15 John.14.16 John.14.17 John.14.18 John.14.19 John.14.20">John 14:14-20</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.17">1 Corinthians 6:17</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.8.9">Romans 8:9</reference> Hence follows an
   ineffable union between him and them. For as in his incarnation he took
   our nature into personal union with his own; so herein he takes our
   persons into a mystical union with himself. Hereby he becomes ours, and
   we are his.
				</p><p>
   And herein he is unspeakably glorious. For this mystery of the
   inhabitation of the same Spirit in him as the head, and the church as
   his body, animating the whole, is a transcendent effect of divine
   wisdom. There is nothing of this nature in the whole creation besides,
   -- no such union, no such mutual communication. The strictest unions
   and relations in nature are but shadows of it, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25 Eph.5.26 Eph.5.27 Eph.5.28 Eph.5.29 Eph.5.30 Eph.5.31 Eph.5.32">Ephesians 5:25-32</reference> Herein
   also is the Lord Christ precious unto them that do believe, but a stone
   of stumbling and a rock of offence unto the disobedient. This glorious,
   ineffable effect of his wisdom and grace; this rare, peculiar, singular
   way of the communication of himself unto the church, is by many
   despised. They know, it may be, some of them, what it is to be joined
   unto a harlot so as to become one flesh; but what it is to be joined
   unto the Lord so as to become one spirit, they know not. But this
   principle and spring of the spiritual life of the church, and of all
   vital, spiritual motions towards God and things heavenly, wherein and
   whereby "our life is hid with Christ in God," is the glory, the
   exaltation, the honour, the security of the church, unto the praise of
   the grace of God. The understanding of it in its causes, effects,
   operations, and privileges wherewith it is accompanied, is to be
   preferred above all the wisdom in and of the world.
				</p><p>
   2. He thus communicates himself unto us, by the formation of a new
   nature, his own nature, in us; so as that the very same spiritual
   nature is in him and in the church. Only, it is so with this
   difference, that in him it is in the absolute perfection of all those
   glorious graces wherein it does consist; in the church it is in various
   measures and degrees, according as he is pleased to communicate it. But
   the same divine nature it is that is in him and us; for, through the
   precious promises of the Gospel, we are made partakers of his Divine
   nature. It is not enough for us that he has taken our nature to be his,
   unless he gives us also his nature to be ours; -- that is, implants in
   our souls all those gracious qualifications, as unto the essence and
   substance of them, wherewith he himself in his human nature is endued.
   This is that new man, that new creature, that divine nature, that
   spirit which is born of the Spirit, that transformation into the image
   of Christ, that putting of him on, that worship of God whereunto in him
   we are created, that the Scripture so fully testifieth unto, <reference osisRef="John.3.6">John 3:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.6.3 Rom.6.4 Rom.6.5 Rom.6.6 Rom.6.7 Rom.6.8">Romans 6:3-8</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>; v. 17; <reference osisRef="Eph.4.20 Eph.4.21 Eph.4.22 Eph.4.23 Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:20-24</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.4">2 Peter 1:4</reference>
				</p><p>
   And that new heavenly nature which is thus formed in believers, as the
   first vital act of that union which is between Christ and them by the
   inhabitation of the same Spirit, is peculiarly his nature. For both is
   it so as it is in him the idea and the exemplar of it in us, --
   inasmuch as we are predestinated to be conformed unto his image, -- and
   as it is wrought or produced in our souls by an emanation of power,
   virtue, and efficiency from him.
				</p><p>
   This is a most heavenly way of the communication of himself unto us,
   wherein of God "he is made unto us wisdom and sanctification." Hereon
   he says of his church, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
   flesh;" -- I see myself, my own nature, in them; whence they are comely
   and desirable. Hereby he makes way to "present it to himself a glorious
   church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but holy and
   without blemish." On this communication of Christ unto us, by the
   forming of his own nature in us, depends all the purity, the beauty,
   the holiness, the inward glory of the church. Hereby is it really,
   substantially, internally separated from the world, and distinguished
   from all others, who, in the outward form of things, in the profession
   and duties of religion, seem to be the same with them. Hereby it
   becomes the first fruits of the creation unto God, bearing forth the
   renovation of his image in the world; -- herein the Lord Christ is, and
   will be, glorious unto all eternity. I only mention these things, which
   deserve to be far more largely insisted on.
				</p><p>
   3. He does the same by that actual insition or implantation into
   himself which he gives us by faith, which is of his own operation. For
   hereon two things do ensue; -- one by the grace or power, the other by
   the law or constitution, of the Gospel; which have a great influence
   into this mystical communication of Christ unto the church.
				</p><p>
   And the first of these is, that hereby there is communicated unto us,
   and we do derive, supplies of spiritual life, sustentation, motion,
   strength in grace, and perseverance from him continually. This is that
   which himself so divinely teacheth in the parable of the vine and its
   branches, <reference osisRef="John.15.1 John.15.2 John.15.3 John.15.4 John.15.5">John 15:1-5</reference> Hereby is there a continual communication from
   his all-fulness of grace unto the whole church and all the members of
   it, unto all the ends and duties of spiritual life. They live,
   nevertheless not they, but Christ liveth in them; and the life which
   they lead in the flesh is by the faith of the Son of God. And the
   other, -- by virtue of the law and constitution of the Gospel, -- is,
   that hereon his righteousness and all the fruits of his mediation are
   imputed unto us; the glory of which mystery the apostle unfolds, Rom.
   iii.-v.
				</p><p>
   I might add hereunto the mutual inbeing that is between him and
   believers by love; for -- the way of the communication of his love unto
   them being by the shedding of it abroad in their hearts by the Holy
   Ghost, and their returns of love unto him being wrought in them by an
   almighty efficiency of the same Spirit -- there is that which is deeply
   mysterious and glorious in it. I might mention also the continuation of
   his discharge of all his offices towards us, whereon all our receptions
   from him, or all the benefits of his mediation whereof we are made
   partakers, do depend. But the few instances that have been given of the
   glory of Christ in this mysterious communication of himself unto his
   church may suffice to give us such a view of it as to fill our hearts
   with holy admiration and thanksgiving.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 11 The glory of Christ in the recapitulation of all things in him">
<title>Chapter 11 The glory of Christ in the recapitulation of all things in him</title>
<p>   In the last place, the Lord Christ is peculiarly and eminently glorious
   in the recapitulation of all things in him, after they had been
   scattered and disordered by sin. This the apostle proposeth as the most
   signal effect of divine wisdom, and the sovereign pleasure of God.
				</p><p>
   "He has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; having made
   known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure,
   which he has purposed in himself: that, in the dispensation of the
   fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ,
   both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.8 Eph.1.9 Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:8-10</reference>
				</p><p>
   For the discovery of the mind of the Holy Ghost in these words, so far
   as I am at present concerned, -- namely, as unto the representation of
   the glory of Christ in them, -- sundry brief observations must be
   premised; and in them it will be necessary that we briefly declare the
   original of all these things in heaven and earth, their primitive
   order, the confusion that ensued thereon, with their restitution in
   Christ, and his glory thereby.
				</p><p>
   1. God alone has all being in him. Hence he gives himself that name, "I
   am," <reference osisRef="Exod.3.14">Exodus 3:14</reference> He was eternally All; when all things else that
   ever were, or now are, or shall be, were nothing. And when they are,
   they are no otherwise but as "they are of him, and through him, and to
   him," <reference osisRef="Rom.11.36">Romans 11:36</reference> Moreover, his being and goodness are the same. The
   goodness of God is the meetness of the Divine Being to be communicative
   of itself in its effects. Hence this is the first notion of the divine
   nature, -- infinite being and goodness, in a nature intelligent and
   self-subsistent. So the apostle declares it, "He that comes to God must
   believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder," <reference osisRef="Heb.11.6">Hebrews 11:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. In this state of infinite, eternal being and goodness, antecedent
   unto any act of wisdom or power without himself to give existence unto
   other things, God was, and is, eternally in himself all that he will
   be, all that he can be, unto eternity. For where there is infinite
   being and infinite goodness, there is infinite blessedness and
   happiness, whereunto nothing can be added. God is always the same. That
   is his name, 'th hv' -- <reference osisRef="Ps.102.27">Psalms 102:27</reference>, "Thou art he," -- always the same.
   All things that are, make no addition unto God, no change in his state.
   His blessedness, happiness, self-satisfaction, as well as all other his
   infinite perfections, were absolutely the same before the creation of
   any thing, whilst there was nothing but himself, as they are since he
   has made all things: for the blessedness of God consists in the
   ineffable mutual inbeing of the three holy persons in the same nature,
   with the immanent reciprocal acting of the Father and the Son in the
   eternal love and complacency of the Spirit. Hereunto nothing can be
   added, herein no change can be made by any external work or effect of
   power. Herein does God act in the perfect knowledge and perfect love of
   his own perfections, unto an infinite acquiescence therein, -- which is
   the divine blessedness. This gives us the true notion of the divine
   nature antecedent unto the manifestation of it made by any outward
   effects:  infinite being and goodness, eternally blessed in the
   knowledge and enjoyment of itself by inconceivable, ineffable, internal
   acting, answering the manner of its subsistence, which is in three
   distinct persons.
				</p><p>
   3. This being and goodness of God, by his own will and pleasure acting
   themselves in infinite wisdom and power, produced the creation of all
   things. Herein he communicated a finite, limited dependent being and
   goodness unto other things without himself. For all being and goodness
   being, as was said, in him alone, it was necessary that the first
   outward work and effect of the divine nature must be the communication
   of being and goodness unto other things. Wherefore, as when he had
   given unto every thing its being out of nothing, by the word of his
   power, saying, Let them be, and they were; so it is said, that he
   looked on all that he had made, "and, behold, they were exceeding
   good," <reference osisRef="Gen.1.31">Genesis 1:31</reference> Being and goodness must be the first outward effects
   of the divine nature, which, being wrought by infinite power and
   wisdom, do represent unto us the glory of God in the creation of all
   things. Infinite being in self-subsistence, which is necessary in the
   first cause and spring of all things, -- infinite goodness to
   communicate the effect of this being unto that which was not, -- and
   infinite wisdom and power in that communication, -- are gloriously
   manifested therein.
				</p><p>
   4. In this state, all things that were made, depended immediately on
   God himself, without the interposition of any other head of influence
   or rule. They had the continuance of their being and its preservation
   from the immediate acting of these properties of the divine nature
   whereby they were made; and their dependence on God was by virtue of
   that law, which was implanted on the principles and powers of their
   several natures by God himself.
				</p><p>
   5. Thus "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." He
   provided himself of two distinct, rational families, that should depend
   on him according to a law of moral obedience, and thereby give glory to
   him; with two distinct habitations for them, cognate unto their nature
   and use, -- heaven above, and the earth beneath. The earth he appointed
   for the habitation of man; which was every way suited unto the
   constitution of his nature, the preservation of his being, and the end
   of his creation in giving glory to God. Heaven he prepared for the
   habitation of the angels; which was suited unto the constitution of
   their nature, the preservation of their being, and the end of their
   creation, in giving glory to God. Wherefore, as man had power and
   dominion over all things here below, and was to use them all unto the
   glory of God, -- by which means God received glory from them also,
   though in themselves brute and inanimate; -- so the angels had the like
   dominion over the celestial and ethereal bodies, wherewith God has
   fitted the place of their habitation, that through the contemplation
   and use of them God might have a revenue of glory and praise from them
   also. To suppose any other race of intellectual creatures, besides
   angels in heaven and men on earth, is not only without all countenance
   from any divine testimony, but it disturbs and disorders the whole
   representation of the glory of God made unto us in the Scripture, and
   the whole design of his wisdom and grace, as declared therein.
   Intellectual creatures not comprehended in that government of God and
   mystery of his wisdom in Christ which the Scripture reveals, are a
   chimera framed in the imaginations of some men, scarce duly sensible of
   what it is to be wise unto sobriety.
				</p><p>
   6. This order of things was beautiful and comely. Hence were they all
   said to be "exceeding good." For each of these families had their own
   immediate, distinct dependence on God. He was the immediate head of
   them. There was no other common head interposed between God and them.
   They were not a head unto one another. There were no communications
   unto them, but what were immediate from God himself. And their union
   among themselves was in this alone, that all their obedience did meet
   and centre in God. So God made the heavens and the earth, and two
   distinct families in them, for himself.
				</p><p>
   7. This beautiful order in itself, this union between the two families
   of God, was disturbed, broken, dissolved by the entrance of sin; for
   hereby part of the family above, and the whole family below, fell off
   from their dependence on God; and ceasing to centre in him as their
   head, they fell into variance and enmity among themselves. For the
   centre of this union and order being removed and lost, nothing but
   enmity and confusion remained among them. Hereon, to show that its
   goodness was lost, God cursed the earth and all that was in it; for it
   was put in subjection unto man, who was now fallen from him. Howbeit he
   cursed not the heavens, which were in subjection unto the angels,
   because some of them only left their habitation; and the habitation of
   the residue was not to be cursed for their sakes. But mankind was
   wholly gone off from God.
				</p><p>
   8. The angels that sinned God utterly rejected for ever, as an example
   of his severity; the whole race of mankind he would not utterly cast
   off, but determined to recover and save a remnant, according to the
   election of grace; which, how he did it in a way of condecency unto all
   his divine perfections, I have elsewhere declared.
				</p><p>
   9. Howbeit, he would not restore them into their former estate, so as
   to have again two distinct families, each in an immediate dependence on
   himself, though he left them in different and distinct habitations,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.3.15">Ephesians 3:15</reference>; but he would gather them both into one, and that under a
   new head, in whom the one part should be preserved from sinning, and
   the other delivered from sin committed.
				</p><p>
   10. This, then, is that which the apostle declares in these words, "To
   gather together in one all things which are in heaven, and which are on
   earth, even in him." And so he again expresseth it, <reference osisRef="Col.1.20">Colossians 1:20</reference>, "To
   reconcile all things unto himself in him, whether they be things in
   earth, or things in heaven." All things were fallen into disorder and
   confusion by sin; they were fallen off from God into variance among
   themselves. God would not restore them into their first order, in an
   immediate dependence on his divine perfections. He would no longer keep
   them in two distinct families; but he would, in his infinite wisdom and
   goodness, gather them up into one common head, on whom they should have
   their immediate dependence, and be reconciled again among themselves.
				</p><p>
   11. This new head, wherein God has gathered up all things in heaven and
   earth into one, one body, one family, on whom is all their dependence,
   in whom they all now consist, is Jesus Christ the Son of God incarnate.
   See <reference osisRef="1Cor.11.3">1 Corinthians 11:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.22 Eph.1.23">Ephesians 1:22-23</reference> This glory was reserved for him; none
   other could be meet for it or worthy of it. See <reference osisRef="Col.1.17 Col.1.18 Col.1.19">Colossians 1:17-19</reference>
				</p><p>
   12. To answer all the ends of this new Head of God's re-collected
   family, all power in heaven and earth, all fulness of grace and glory,
   is committed unto him. There is no communication from God, no act of
   rule towards this family, no supply of virtue, power, grace, or
   goodness unto angels or men, but what is immediately from this new head
   whereinto they are gathered. In him they all consist, on him do they
   depend, unto him are they subject; in their relation unto him doth
   their peace, union, and agreement among themselves consist. This is the
   recapitulation of all things intended by the apostle.
				</p><p>
   13. It is true that he acts distinctly and variously towards the two
   parts of the re-collected family of angels and men, according as their
   different states and conditions do require. For, -- 1. We had need of a
   reparation by redemption and grace, which the angels had not. 2. Angels
   were capable of immediate confirmation in glory, which we are not,
   until we come to heaven. Therefore, -- 1. He assumed our nature that it
   might be repaired, which he did not [by] the nature of the angels. 2.
   He gives us union unto himself by his Spirit, which exalts us into a
   dignity and honour meet for fellowship with them in the same family.
				</p><p>
   This is a brief account of the mysterious work of divine wisdom in the
   recapitulation of all things in Jesus Christ; and herein is he
   transcendently glorious, or his glory herein is far above our
   comprehension; yet some things may be observed, to direct us in the
   view and contemplation of it. As, --
				</p><p>
   1. He alone was a meet and capable subject of it. He alone could bear
   the weight of this glory. No mere creature in heaven or earth was meet
   to be thus made the head of the whole new creation of God. In none of
   them could all things consist. None of them was meet to be thus in the
   place of God, to have all things depend upon him, and be put in
   subjection unto him; so as that there should be no communication
   between God and the creation but by and through him alone. Wherefore,
   when the Holy Ghost assigns this glory unto him, he so describes him as
   that we may discern his singular meetness for it; as, that he is "the
   brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person,
   upholding all things by the word of his power," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>; -- that he
   is "the image of the invisible God, the first born of every creature,
   by whom all things were created that are in heaven, and that are in
   earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
   principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him;
   and he is before all things, and by him all things consist," <reference osisRef="Col.1.15 Col.1.16 Col.1.17">Colossians 1:15-17</reference> Such a one alone, and no other, was meet to bear and uphold this
   glory. And the glory of his person is such, as that it is the
   blessedness of all creatures to centre in this glory of his office.
				</p><p>
   2. This is that glory which God designed unto his only Son incarnate,
   and it gives us a little view into the glory of that mystery, the
   wonderful eternal design of God to glorify himself in the incarnation
   of Christ. God would have his eternal, his only-begotten Son to be
   incarnate, to take our nature on him, -- to be made man. What is his
   design in this incomprehensible work of his wisdom, love, and power?
   Indeed, in the first place, it was for the redemption of the church, by
   the sacrifice of himself, and other acts of his mediation. But there is
   that which is more general and comprehensive, and wherein all the
   concerns of the glory of God do centre. And this was, that he might
   "gather all things into one" in him; -- that the whole creation,
   especially that which was to be eternally blessed, should have a new
   head given unto it, for its sustentation, preservation, order, honour,
   and safety. All springs are in him, and all streams are unto him, and
   in and by him unto God. Who can express the divine beauty, order, and
   harmony of all things that are in this, their recapitulation in Christ?
   The union and communion between angels and men, -- the order of the
   whole family in heaven and earth, -- the communication of life, grace,
   power, mercy, and consolation to the church, -- the rule and disposal
   of all things unto the glory of God, -- do all depend hereon. This
   glory God designed unto his Son incarnate; and it was the greatest, the
   highest that could be communicated unto him. For, as the apostle
   observes, all things are put in subjection unto him, he only excepted
   who does so make them subject; that is, God the Father, <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.27">1 Corinthians 15:27</reference>
				</p><p>
   There is no contemplation of the glory of Christ that ought more to
   affect the hearts of them that do believe with delight and joy, than
   this, of the recapitulation of all things in him. One view by faith of
   him in the place of God, as the supreme head of the whole creation.
   Moving, acting, guiding, and disposing of it, will bring in spiritual
   refreshment unto a believing refreshment unto a believing soul.
				</p><p>
   And it will do so the more, in that it gives a glorious representation
   of his divine nature also. For that any mere creature should thus be a
   head of life, motion, and power, as also of sovereign rule and
   disposal, of the whole new creation, with all things reduced into order
   thereby, is not only an impious, but a foolish imagination.
				</p><p>
   Did we live more in the contemplation of this glory of Christ, and of
   the wisdom of God in this recapitulation of all things in him, there is
   not anything of our duty which it would not mind us of, nor anything of
   privilege which it would not give us a sense of, as might easily be
   demonstrated.
				</p><p>
   3. In particular, the Lord Christ is glorious herein, in that the whole
   breach made on the glory of God in the creation, by the entrance of
   sin, is hereby repaired and made up. The beauty and order of the whole
   creation consisted in its dependence on God, by the obedience of the
   rational part of it, angels and men. Thereby were the being, the
   goodness, the wisdom, and power of God made manifest. But the beauty of
   this order was defaced, and the manifestation of the divine perfections
   unto the glory of God eclipsed, by the entrance of sin. But all is
   restored, repaired, and made up, in this recapitulation of all things
   in one new head, -- Christ Jesus; yea, the whole curious frame of the
   divine creation is rendered more beautiful than it was before. Hence
   the whole of it groaneth for the interest of each part in this
   restoration of all things. Whatever there is of order, of beauty, of
   glory, in heaven above, or in earth beneath, it all ariseth from this
   new relation of the creation unto the Son of God. Whatever is not
   gathered into one, even in him, in its place, and according to its
   measure, is under darkness, disorder, and the curse. Hence the Jews
   have a saying, that "in the days of the Messiah all things shall be
   healed, but the serpent;" that is, the devil, and wicked men, which are
   as his seed.
				</p><p>
   4. He is glorious herein, in that he is appointed as the only means of
   exerting and expressing all the treasures of the infinite wisdom of God
   towards his creatures. The wisdom of God is absolutely, always, and in
   all things infinite. God does not, God cannot, act with more wisdom in
   one thing than in another; as in the creation of man, than in that of
   any inanimate creatures. In the first creation, infinite wisdom was the
   inseparable companion of infinite power: "How marvellous are thy works,
   O Lord! in wisdom hast thou made them all." But when the effects of
   this divine wisdom, in their principal beauty and glory, were defaced,
   greater treasures of wisdom were required unto their reparation. And in
   this re-collection of all things in Christ, did God lay them forth unto
   the utmost of whatever he will do in dealing with his creatures. So the
   apostle expresseth it, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:10</reference>, "To the intent that now, unto the
   principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the
   church the manifold wisdom of God." By the recapitulation of all things
   into this one head, the manifold, various, unsearchable wisdom of God
   was made known unto the angels themselves. They knew not before of the
   design and work of God after the entrance of sin. These could not
   comprehend the wisdom that might repair that loss. They knew not that
   divine wisdom had another way to take herein; at least they knew not
   what way that should be. But hereby the manifold wisdom of God, his
   infinite wisdom in the treasures of it, able by various ways to attain
   the ends of his glory, was made known unto them. Herein -- namely, in
   the re-collection of all things in Christ -- divine wisdom has made
   known and represented itself in all its stores and treasures unto
   angels and men. "In him are hid," and by him are displayed, "all the
   treasures of wisdom," <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference> Herein is he glorious, and will be so
   to eternity.
				</p><p>
   5. He is glorious herein, in that hereby firmness and security is
   communicated unto the whole new creation. The first creation in its
   order was a curious and glorious fabric. But every thing depending
   immediately on God, by virtue of the principles of its own nature and
   the law of its obedience, all was brought unto a loss by the sin of
   angels and men. But now every thing that belongs unto this new
   creation, even every believer in the world, as well as the angels in
   heaven, being gathered together in this one head, the whole and all,
   and every part and member of it, even every particular believer, are
   secured from ruin, such as befell all things before. In this new Head
   they have an indissoluble consistency.
				</p><p>
   But manum de tabula. I shall insist on no more instances of this
   nature, which plentifully offer themselves in the Scripture unto us.
   For who can declare this glory of Christ? who can speak of these things
   as he ought? I am so far from designing to set forth the whole of it,
   that I am deeply sensible how little a portion I can comprehend of the
   least part of it. Nor can I attain unto any satisfaction in these
   Meditations, but what issues in an humble admiration.

<title>Chapter 12 Differences between our beholding the glory of Christ by faith in this world and by sight in heaven the first of them explained</title>
<p>   "We walk" here "by faith, and not by sight," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.7">2 Corinthians 5:7</reference>; that is, in
   the life of God, in our walking before him, in the whole of our
   obedience therein, we are under the conduct and influence of faith, and
   not of sight. Those are the two spiritual powers of our souls; -- by
   the one whereof we are made partakers of grace, holiness, and obedience
   in this life; and by the other, of eternal blessedness and glory.
				</p><p>
   Both these -- namely, faith and sight, the one in this life, the other
   in that which is to come -- have the same immediate object. For they
   are the abilities of the soul to go forth unto, and to embrace their
   object. Now, this object of them both is the glory of Christ, as has
   been declared, as also what that glory is, and wherein it does consist;
   wherefore my present design is to inquire into the difference that is
   between our beholding of the glory of Christ in this world by faith,
   and the vision which we shall have of the same glory hereafter.
				</p><p>
   The latter of these is peculiarly intended in that prayer of our Lord
   Jesus Christ for his disciples, <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference>, "Father, I will that
   they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am; that they may
   behold my glory, which thou hast given me." But I shall not distinctly
   insist upon it, my design being another way, respecting principally the
   work of God in this life, and the privileges which we enjoy thereby.
   Yet I shall now take a short prospect of that also; not absolutely, but
   in the differences that are between faith and sight, or the view which
   we have of the glory of Christ in this world by faith, and that which
   they enjoy by vision who are above; -- the object of them both being
   adequately the same.
				</p><p>
   But herein, also, I shall have respect only unto some of those things
   which concern our practice, or the present immediate exercise of faith.
   For I have elsewhere handled at large the state of the church above, or
   that of present glory, giving an account of the administration of the
   office of Christ in heaven, his presence among the glorified souls, and
   the adoration of God under his conduct. I have also declared the
   advantage which they have by being with him, and the prospect they have
   of his glory. Therefore these things must here be only touched on.
				</p><p>
   These differences may be referred unto two heads:  1. Those which
   arise from the different natures and acting of those means and
   instruments whereby we apprehend this glory of Christ, -- namely, faith
   and vision; and, 2. Those that arise from the different effects
   produced by them. Instances in each kind shall be given.
				</p><p>
   1. The view which we have of the glory of Christ by faith in this world
   is obscure, dark, inevident, reflexive. So the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="1Cor.13.12">1 Corinthians 13:12</reference>, "Now we see through a glass darkly," di' esoptrou en
   ainigmati; -- "through" or by "a glass, in a riddle," a parable, a dark
   saying. There is a double figurative limitation put upon our view of
   the glory of Christ, taken from the two ways of our perception of what
   we apprehend, -- namely, the sight of things, and the hearing of words.
				</p><p>
   The first is, that we have this view not directly, but reflexively and
   by way of a representation, as in a glass. For I take the glass here,
   not to be optical or a prospective, which helps the sight, but a
   speculum, or a glass which reflects an image of what we do behold. It
   is a sight like that which we have of a man in a glass, when we see not
   his person or substance, but an image or representation of them only,
   which is imperfect.
				</p><p>
   The shadow or image of this glory of Christ is drawn in the Gospel, and
   therein we behold it as the likeness of a man represented unto us in a
   glass; and although it be obscure and imperfect in comparison of his
   own real, substantial glory, which is the object of vision in heaven,
   yet is it the only image and representation of himself which he has
   left, and given unto us in this world. That woeful, cursed invention of
   framing images of him out of stocks and stones, however adorned, or
   representations of him by the art of painting, are so far from
   presenting unto the minds of men any thing of his real glory, that
   nothing can be more effectual to divert their thoughts and
   apprehensions from it. But by this figurative expression of seeing in a
   glass, the apostle declares the comparative imperfection of our present
   view of the glory of Christ.
				</p><p>
   But the allusion may be taken from an optic glass or tube also, [7]
   whereby the sight of the eye is helped in beholding things at a great
   distance. By the aid of such glasses, men will discover stars or
   heavenly lights, which, by reason of their distance from us, the eye of
   itself is no way able to discern. And those which we do see are more
   fully represented, though remote enough from being so perfectly. Such a
   glass is the Gospel, without which we can make no discovery of Christ
   at all; but in the use of it we are far enough from beholding him in
   the just dimensions of his glory.
				</p><p>
   And he adds another intimation of this imperfection, in an allusion
   unto the way whereby things are proposed and conveyed unto the minds
   and apprehensions of men. Now this is by words. And these are either
   plain, proper, and direct, or dark, figurative, and parabolical. And
   this latter way makes the conception of things to be difficult and
   imperfect; and by reason of the imperfection of our view of the glory
   of Christ by faith in this world, the apostle says it is in ainigmati,
   in "a riddle." These ainigmata the Psalmist calls chydvt, "dark
   sayings," <reference osisRef="Ps.78.2">Psalms 78:2</reference>
				</p><p>
   But here it must be observed, that the description and representation
   of the Lord Christ and his glory in the Gospel is not absolutely or in
   itself either dark or obscure; yea, it is perspicuous, plain, and
   direct. Christ is therein evidently set forth crucified, exalted,
   glorified. But the apostle does not here discourse concerning the way
   or means of the revelation of it unto us, but of the means or
   instrument whereby we comprehend that revelation. This is our faith,
   which, as it is in us, being weak and imperfect, we comprehend the
   representation that is made unto us of the glory of Christ as men do
   the sense of a dark saying, a riddle, a parable; that is, imperfectly,
   and with difficulty.
				</p><p>
   On the account hereof we may say at present, how little a portion is it
   that we know of him! as Job speaks of God, chap. xxvi. 14. How
   imperfect are our conceptions of him! How weak are our minds in their
   management! There is no part of his glory that we can fully comprehend.
   And what we do comprehend, -- there is a comprehension in faith, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.18">Ephesians 3:18</reference>, -- we cannot abide in the steady contemplation of. For ever
   blessed be that sovereign grace, whence it is that He who "commanded
   light to shine out of darkness has shined into our hearts, to give us
   the light of the knowledge of his own glory in the face of Jesus
   Christ," and therein of the glory of Christ himself; -- that he has so
   revealed him unto us, as that we may love him, admire him, and obey
   him: but constantly, steadily, and clearly to behold his glory in this
   life we are not able; "for we walk by faith, and not by sight."
				</p><p>
   Hence our sight of him here is as it were by glances, -- liable to be
   clouded by many interpositions. "Behold, he standeth behind the wall,
   he looketh forth at the windows, showing" (mtsyts, flourishing)
   "himself through the lattice," <reference osisRef="Song.2.9">Song of Solomon 2:9</reference> There is a great
   interposition between him and us, as a wall; and the means of the
   discovery of himself unto us, as through a window and lattice, include
   a great instability and imperfection in our view and apprehension of
   him. There is a wall between him and us, which yet he standeth behind.
   Our present mortal state is this wall, which must be demolished before
   we can see him as he is. In the meantime he looketh through the windows
   of the ordinances of the Gospel. He gives us sometimes, when he is
   pleased to stand in those windows, a view of himself; but it is
   imperfect, as is our sight of a man through a window. The appearances
   of him at these windows are full of refreshment unto the souls of them
   that do believe. But our view of them is imperfect, transient, and does
   not abide; -- we are for the most part quickly left to bemoan what we
   have lost. And then our best is but to cry, "the hart panteth after the
   water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth
   for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before thee?"
   When wilt thou again give me to see thee, though but as through the
   windows? Alas! what distress do we ofttimes sit down in, after these
   views of Christ and his glory! But he proceeds farther yet; and
   flourishes himself through the lattices. This displaying of the glory
   of Christ, called the flourishing of himself, is by the promises of the
   Gospel, as they are explained in the ministry of the Word. In them are
   represented unto us the desirable beauties and glories of Christ. How
   precious, how amiable is he, as represented in them! How are the souls
   of believers ravished with the views of them! Yet is this discovery of
   him also but as through a lattice. We see him but by parts, --
   unsteadily and unevenly.
				</p><p>
   Such, I say, is the sight of the glory of Christ which we have in this
   world by faith. It is dark, -- it is but in part. It is but weak,
   transient, imperfect, partial. It is but little that we can at any time
   discover of it; it is but a little while that we can abide in the
   contemplation of what we do discover. "Rara hora, breves mora."
   Sometimes it is unto us as the sun when it is under a cloud, -- we
   cannot perceive it. When he hideth his face, who then can behold him?
   As Job speaks, so may we, "Behold, I go forward, but he is not there;
   and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand, where he
   doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right
   hand, that I cannot see him," chap. xxiii. 8, 9. Which way soever we
   turn ourselves, and what duties soever we apply ourselves unto, we can
   obtain no distinct view of his glory. Yet, on the other hand, it is
   sometimes as the sun when it shines in its brightness, and we cannot
   bear the rays of it. In infinite condescension he says unto his church,
   "Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me," <reference osisRef="Song.6.5">Song of Solomon 6:5</reference>,
   -- as if he could not bear that overcoming affectionate love, which
   looks through the eyes of the church in its acting of faith on him. Ah!
   how much more do we find our souls overcome with his love, when at any
   time he is pleased to make any clear discoveries of his glory unto us!
				</p><p>
   Let us now, on the other hand, take a little consideration of that
   vision which we shall have of the same glory in heaven, that we may
   compare them together.
				</p><p>
   Vision, or the sight which we shall have of the glory of Christ in
   heaven, is immediate, direct, intuitive; and therefore steady, even,
   and constant and it is so on a double account:  1. Of the object which
   shall be proposed unto us; 2. Of the visive power or faculty wherewith
   we shall be endued: from the imperfection of both which in this world
   ariseth the imperfection of our view of the glory of Christ by faith,
   as has been declared.
				</p><p>
   1. The object of it will be real and substantial. Christ himself, in
   his own person, with all his glory, shall be continually with us,
   before us, proposed unto us. We shall no longer have an image, a
   representation of him, such as is the delineation of his glory in the
   Gospel. We "shall see him," saith the apostle, "face to face," <reference osisRef="1Cor.13.12">1 Corinthians 13:12</reference>; -- which he opposeth unto our seeing him darkly as in a
   glass, which is the utmost that faith can attain to. "We shall see him
   as he is", <reference osisRef="1John.3.2">1 John 3:2</reference>; -- not as now, in an imperfect description of
   him. As a man sees his neighbour when they stand and converse together
   face to face, so shall we see the Lord Christ in his glory; and not as
   Moses, who had only a transient sight of some parts of the glory of
   God, when he caused it to pass by him.
				</p><p>
   There will be use herein of our bodily eyes, as shall be declared. For,
   as Job says, in our flesh shall we see our Redeemer, and our eyes shall
   behold him, chap. xix. 25-27. That corporeal sense shall not be
   restored unto us, and that glorified above what we can conceive, but
   for this great use of the eternal beholding of Christ and his glory.
   Unto whom is it not a matter of rejoicing, that with the same eyes
   wherewith they see the tokens and signs of him in the sacrament of the
   supper, they shall behold himself immediately in his own person? But
   principally, as we shall see immediately, this vision is intellectual.
   It is not, therefore, the mere human nature of Christ that is the
   object of it, but his divine person, as that nature subsisteth therein.
   What is that perfection which we shall have (for that which is perfect
   must come and do away that which is in part) in the comprehension of
   the hypostatical union, I understand not; but this I know, that in the
   immediate beholding of the person of Christ, we shall see a glory in it
   a thousand times above what here we can conceive. The excellencies of
   infinite wisdom, love, and power therein, will be continually before
   us. And all the glories of the person of Christ which we have before
   weakly and faintly inquired into, will be in our sight for evermore.
				</p><p>
   Hence the ground and cause of our blessedness is, that "we shall ever
   be with the Lord," <reference osisRef="1Thess.4.17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</reference>, -- as himself prays, "that we may
   be with him where he is, to behold his glory." Here we have some dark
   views of it, -- we cannot perfectly behold it, until we are with him
   where he is. Thereon our sight of him will be direct, intuitive, and
   constant.
				</p><p>
   There is a glory, there will be so, subjectively in us in the beholding
   of this glory of Christ, which is at present incomprehensible. For it
   does not yet appear what we ourselves shall be, <reference osisRef="1John.3.2">1 John 3:2</reference> Who can
   declare what a glory it will be in us to behold this glory of Christ?
   And how excellent, then, is that glory of Christ itself!
				</p><p>
   This immediate sight of Christ is that which all the saints of God in
   this life do breathe and pant after. Hence are they willing to be
   dissolved, or "desire to depart, that they may be with Christ," which
   is best for them, <reference osisRef="Phil.1.23">Philippians 1:23</reference> They choose "to be absent from the body,
   and present with the Lord," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.8">2 Corinthians 5:8</reference>; or that they may enjoy the
   inexpressibly longed-for sight of Christ in his glory. Those who do not
   so long for it, whose souls and minds are not frequently visited with
   earnest desires after it, unto whom the thoughts of it are not their
   relief in trouble, and their chiefest joy, are carnal, blind, and
   cannot see afar off. He that is truly spiritual entertains and
   refresheth himself with thoughts hereof continually.
				</p><p>
   2. It will be so from that visive power or faculty of beholding the
   glory of Christ which we shall then receive. Without this we cannot see
   him as he is. When he was transfigured in the mount, and had on his
   human nature some reflections of his divine glory, his disciples that
   were with him were rather amazed than refreshed by it, <reference osisRef="Matt.17.6">Matthew 17:6</reference>
   They saw his glory, but spake thereon "they knew not what," <reference osisRef="Luke.9.30 Luke.9.31 Luke.9.32 Luke.9.33">Luke 9:30-33</reference> And the reason hereof was, because no man in this life can have
   a visive power, either spiritual or corporeal, directly and immediately
   to behold the real glory of Christ.
				</p><p>
   Should the Lord Jesus appear now to any of us in his majesty and glory,
   it would not be unto our edification nor consolation. For we are not
   meet nor able, by the power of any light or grace that we have
   received, or can receive, to bear the immediate appearance and
   representation of them. His beloved apostle John had leaned on his
   bosom probably many a time in his life, in the intimate familiarities
   of love; but when he afterward appeared unto him in his glory, "he fell
   at his feet as dead," <reference osisRef="Rev.1.17">Revelation of John 1:17</reference> And when he appeared unto Paul, all
   the account he could give thereof was, "that he saw a light from
   heaven, above the brightness of the sun;" whereon he, and all that were
   with him, "fell to the ground," <reference osisRef="Acts.26.13 Acts.26.14">Acts 26:13-14</reference>
				</p><p>
   And this was one reason why, in the days of his ministry here on earth,
   his glory was veiled with the infirmities of the flesh, and all sorts
   of sufferings, as we have before related. The church in this life is no
   way meet, by the grace which it can be made partaker of, to converse
   with him in the immediate manifestations of his glory.
				</p><p>
   And therefore those who dream of his personal reign on the earth before
   the day of judgment, unless they suppose that all the saints shall be
   perfectly glorified also (which is only to bring down heaven to the
   earth for awhile, to no purpose), provide not at all for the
   edification or consolation of the church. For no present grace,
   advanced unto the highest degree whereof in this world it is capable,
   can make us meet for an immediate converse with Christ in his unveiled
   glory.
				</p><p>
   How much more abominable is the folly of men, who would represent the
   Lord Christ in his present glory by pictures and images of him! When
   they have done their utmost with their burnished glass and gildings, an
   eye of flesh can not only behold it, but, if it be guided by reason,
   see it contemptible and foolish. But the true glory of Christ, neither
   inward nor outward sight can bear the rays of it in this life.
				</p><p>
   The dispensation which we are meet for is only that of his presence
   with us by his Spirit. We know him now no more after the flesh, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.16">2 Corinthians 5:16</reference> We are advanced above that way and means of the knowledge of him
   by the fleshly, carnal ordinances of the Old Testament. And we know him
   not according unto that bodily presence of his which his disciples
   enjoyed in the days of his flesh. We have attained somewhat above that
   also. For such was the nature of his ministry here on earth, that there
   could not be the promised dispensation of the Spirit until that was
   finished. Therefore he tells his disciples that it was expedient for
   them that he should go away, and send the Spirit to them, <reference osisRef="John.16.7">John 16:7</reference>
   Hereon they had a clearer view of the glory of Christ than they could
   have by beholding him in the flesh. This is our spiritual posture and
   condition. We are past the knowledge of him according to the flesh, --
   we cannot attain nor receive the sight of him in glory; but the life
   which we now lead is by the faith of the Son of God.
				</p><p>
   I shall not here inquire into the nature of this vision, or the power
   and ability which we shall have in heaven to behold the glory of
   Christ. Some few things may be mentioned, as it relates unto our minds,
   and our bodies also, after the resurrection.
				</p><p>
   1. For the mind, it shall be perfectly freed from all that darkness,
   unsteadiness, and other incapacities, which here it is accompanied
   with; and whereby it is weakened, hindered, and obstructed, in the
   exercise of faith. And they are of two sorts.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Such as are the remainders of that depravation of our natures
   which came upon us by sin. Hereby our minds became wholly vain, dark,
   and corrupt, as the Scripture testifieth, -- utterly unable to discern
   spiritual things in a due manner. This is so far cured and removed in
   this life by grace, as that those who were darkness do become light in
   the Lord, or are enabled to live unto God under the conduct of a new
   spiritual light communicated unto them. But it is so cured and removed
   in part only, it is not perfectly abolished. Hence are all our
   remaining weaknesses and incapacities in discerning things spiritual
   and eternal, which we yet groan under, and long for deliverance from.
   No footsteps, no scars or marks that ever it had place in our minds
   shall abide in glory, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:27</reference> Nothing shall weaken, disturb, or
   incapacitate our souls, in acting all their powers, unimpeded by
   vanity, diversions, weakness, inability, upon their proper objects. The
   excellency hereof, in universal liberty and power, we cannot here
   comprehend; nor can we yet conceive the glory and beauty of those
   immixed spiritual actings of our minds which shall have no clog upon
   them, no encumbrance in them, no alloy of dross accompanying them. One
   pure act of spiritual sight in discerning the glory of Christ, -- one
   pure act of love in cleaving unto God, -- will bring in more
   blessedness and satisfaction into our minds than in this world we are
   capable of.
				</p><p>
   (2.) There is an incapacity in our minds, as unto their actings on
   things spiritual and eternal, that is merely natural, from the posture
   wherein they are, and the figure which they are to make in this life.
   For they are here clothed with flesh, and that debased and corrupted.
   Now, in this state, though the mind act its conceptions by the body as
   its organ and instrument, yet is it variously straitened, encumbered,
   and impeded in the exercise of its native powers, especially towards
   things heavenly, by this prison of the flesh, wherein it is immured.
   There is an angelical excellency in the pure actings of the soul when
   delivered from all material instruments of them, or when they are all
   glorified and made suitable helps in its utmost spiritual activity. How
   and by what degrees our minds shall be freed from these obstructions in
   their beholding the glory of Christ shall be afterward declared.
				</p><p>
   2. Again, a new light, the light of glory, shall be implanted in them.
   There is a light in nature, which is the power of a man to discern the
   things of man; -- an ability to know, perceive, and judge of things
   natural. It is that "spirit of a man" which "is the candle of the Lord,
   searching all the inward parts of the belly," <reference osisRef="Prov.20.27">Proverbs 20:27</reference>
				</p><p>
   But by the light hereof no man can discern spiritual things in a due
   manner, as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.11 1Cor.2.12 1Cor.2.13 1Cor.2.14 1Cor.2.15">1 Corinthians 2:11-15</reference> Wherefore God gives
   a superior, a supernatural light, the light of faith and grace, unto
   them whom he effectually calls unto the knowledge of himself by Jesus
   Christ. He shines into their hearts, to give them the knowledge of his
   glory in the face of his dear Son. Howbeit this new light does not
   abolish, blot out, or render useless, the other light of nature, as the
   sun, when it riseth, extinguisheth the light of the stars; but it
   directs it and rectifies it as unto its principle, object, and end. Yet
   is it in itself a light quite of another nature. But he who has only
   the former light can understand nothing of it, because he has no taste
   or experience of its power and operations. He may talk of it, and make
   inquiries about it, but he knows it not.
				</p><p>
   Now, we have received this light of faith and grace, whereby we discern
   spiritual things, and behold the glory of Christ in the imperfect
   manner before described. But in heaven there shall be a superadded
   light of glory, which shall make the mind itself "shine as the
   firmament," <reference osisRef="Dan.12.3">Daniel 12:3</reference> I shall only say three things of it. 1. That
   as the light of grace does not destroy or abolish the light of nature,
   but rectify and improve it, so the light of glory shall not abolish or
   destroy the light of faith and grace, but, by incorporating with it,
   render it absolutely perfect. 2. That as by the light of nature we
   cannot clearly comprehend the true nature and efficacy of the light of
   grace, because it is of another kind, and is seen only in its own
   light; so by the light of grace we cannot absolutely comprehend this
   light of glory, being of a peculiar kind and nature, seen perfectly
   only by its own light. It does not appear what we shall be. 3. That
   this is the best notion we can have of this light of glory, -- that, in
   the first instance of its operation, it perfectly transforms the soul
   into the image and likeness of Christ.
				</p><p>
   This is the progress of our nature unto its rest and blessedness. The
   principles remaining in it concerning good and evil, with its practical
   convictions, are not destroyed but improved by grace; as its blindness,
   darkness, and enmity to God are in part taken away. Being renewed by
   grace, what it receives here of spiritual life and light shall never be
   destroyed, but be perfected in glory. Grace renews nature; glory
   perfects grace; and so the whole soul is brought unto its rest in God.
   We have an image of it in the blind man whom our Saviour cured, <reference osisRef="Mark.8.22 Mark.8.23 Mark.8.24">Mark 8:22-24</reference> He was absolutely blind, -- born so, no doubt. Upon the
   first touch, his eyes were opened, and he saw, but very obscurely; --
   he saw men walking like trees. But on the second, he saw all things
   clearly. Our minds in themselves are absolutely blind. The first
   visitation of them by grace gives them a sight of things spiritual,
   heavenly, and eternal; but it is obscure and unsteady. The sight of
   glory makes all things clear and evident.
				</p><p>
   3. The body as glorified, with its senses, shall have its use and peace
   herein. After we are clothed again with our flesh, we shall see our
   Redeemer with our eyes. We know not here what power and spirituality
   there will be in the acts of our glorified bodies. Such they will be as
   shall bear a part in eternal blessedness. Holy Stephen, the first
   martyr, took up somewhat of glory by anticipation before he died. For
   when he was brought to his trial before the council, all that sat
   therein, "looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as the face of an
   angel," <reference osisRef="Acts.6.15">Acts 6:15</reference> He had his transfiguration, according unto his
   measure, answerable unto that of our blessed Saviour in the mount. And
   by this initial beam of glory he received such a piercing vivacity and
   edge on his bodily eyes, that through all those inconceivable distances
   between the earth and the residence of the blessed, he looked
   steadfastly into heaven, and "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
   at the right hand of God," <reference osisRef="Acts.7.55 Acts.7.56">Acts 7:55-56</reference> Who, then, can declare
   what will be the power and acting of this sense of sight when perfectly
   glorified; or what sweetness and refreshment may be admitted into our
   souls thereby?
				</p><p>
   It was a privilege (who would not have longed to partake of it?) to
   have seen Him with our bodily eyes in the days of his flesh, as did the
   apostles and his other disciples. Howbeit he was not then glorified
   himself in the manifestation of his glory; nor they who saw him, in the
   change or transformation of their nature. How great this privilege was,
   himself declares unto those that so saw him, <reference osisRef="Matt.13.17">Matthew 13:17</reference>, "Verily I
   say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see
   those things which ye see;" whereunto we shall speak immediately. And
   if this were so excellent a privilege as that we cannot but
   congratulate them by whom it was enjoyed, how excellent, how glorious
   will it be, when with these eyes of ours, gloriously purified and
   strengthened beyond those of Stephen, we shall behold Christ himself
   immediately in the fulness of his glory! He alone perfectly understands
   the greatness and excellency hereof, who prayed his Father that those
   who "believe in him may be where he is, so to behold his glory."
				</p><p>
   These are some of the grounds of this first difference between our
   beholding the glory of Christ by faith here, and by immediate vision
   hereafter. Hence the one is weak, imperfect, obscure, reflexive; the
   other direct, immediate, even, and constant; -- and we may stay a
   little in the contemplation of these things.
				</p><p>
   This view of the glory of Christ which we have now spoken unto is that
   which we are breathing and panting after; that which the Lord Christ
   prays that we may arrive unto; that which the apostle testifies to be
   our best; -- the best thing or state which our nature is capable of, --
   that which brings eternal rest and satisfaction unto our souls.
				</p><p>
   Here our souls are burdened with innumerable infirmities, and our faith
   is clogged in its operations by ignorance and darkness. This makes our
   best estate and highest attainments to be accompanied with groans for
   deliverance: "We which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we
   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
   redemption of our body," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.23">Romans 8:23</reference> Yea, whilst we are in this
   tabernacle, we groan earnestly, as being burdened, because we are not
   "absent from the body, and present with the Lord," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.2 2Cor.5.4 2Cor.5.8">2 Corinthians 5:2, 4, 8</reference>
   The more we grow in faith and spiritual light, the more sensible are we
   of our present burdens, and the more vehemently do we groan for
   deliverance into the perfect liberty of the sons of God. This is the
   posture of their minds who have received the first fruit of the Spirit
   in the most eminent degree. The nearer any one is to heaven, the more
   earnestly he desires to be there, because Christ is there. For the more
   frequent and steady are our views of him by faith, the more do we long
   and groan for the removal of all obstructions and interpositions in our
   so doing. Now groaning is [the expression of] a vehement desire, mixed
   with sorrow, for the present want of what is desired. The desire has
   sorrow, and that sorrow has joy and refreshment in it; -- like a shower
   that falls on a man in a garden in the spring; it wets him, but withal
   refresheth him with the savour it causeth in the flowers and herbs of
   the garden where he is. And this groaning, which, when it is constant
   and habitual, is one of the choicest effects of faith in this life,
   respects what we would be delivered from, and what we would attain
   unto. The first is expressed, <reference osisRef="Rom.7.24">Romans 7:24</reference>, the other in the places now
   mentioned. And this triune, with an intermixture of some sighs from
   weariness by the troubles, sorrows, pains, sicknesses of this life, is
   the best we can here attain unto.
				</p><p>
   Alas! we cannot here think of Christ, but we are quickly ashamed of,
   and troubled at, our own thoughts; so confused are they, so unsteady,
   so imperfect. Commonly they issue in a groan or a sigh: Oh! when shall
   we come unto him? when shall we be ever with him? when shall we see him
   as he is? And if at any time he begins to give more than ordinary
   evidences and intimations of his glory and love unto our souls, we are
   not able to bear them, so as to give them any abiding residence in our
   minds. But ordinarily this trouble and groaning is amongst our best
   attainments in this world, -- a trouble which, I pray God, I may never
   be delivered from, until deliverance do come at once from this state of
   mortality; yea, the good Lord increase this trouble more and more in
   all that believe.
				</p><p>
   The heart of a believer affected with the glory of Christ, is like the
   needle touched with the loadstone. It can no longer be quiet, no longer
   be satisfied in a distance from him. It is put into a continual motion
   towards him. This motion, indeed, is weak and tremulous. Pantings,
   breathing, sighings, groanings in prayer, in meditations, in the secret
   recesses of our minds, are the life of it. However, it is continually
   pressing towards him. But it obtains not its point, it comes not to its
   centre and rest, in this world.
				</p><p>
   But now above, all things are clear and serene, -- all plain and
   evident in our beholding the glory of Christ, -- we shall be ever with
   him, and see him as he is. This is heaven, this is blessedness, this is
   eternal rest.
				</p><p>
   The person of Christ in all his glory shall be continually before us;
   and the eyes of our understandings shall be so gloriously illuminated,
   as that we shall be able steadily to behold and comprehend that glory.
				</p><p>
   But, alas! here at present our minds recoil, our meditations fail, our
   hearts are overcome, our thoughts confused, and our eyes turn aside
   from the lustre of this glory; nor can we abide in the contemplation of
   it. But there, an immediate, constant view of it, will bring in
   everlasting refreshment and joy unto our whole souls.
				</p><p>
   This beholding of the glory of Christ given him by his Father, is,
   indeed, subordinate unto the ultimate vision of the essence of God.
   What that is we cannot well conceive; only we know that the "pure in
   heart shall see God." But it has such an immediate connection with it,
   and subordination unto it, as that without it we can never behold the
   face of God as the objective blessedness of our souls. For he is, and
   shall be to eternity, the only means of communication between God and
   the church.
				</p><p>
   And we may take some direction in our looking into and longing after
   this perfect view of the glory of Christ, from the example of the
   saints under the Old Testament. The sight which they had of the glory
   of Christ -- for they also saw his glory through the obscurity of its
   revelation, and its being veiled with types and shadows -- was weak and
   imperfect in the most illuminated believers; much inferior unto what we
   now have by faith, through the Gospel. Yet such it was as encouraged
   them to inquire and search diligently into what was revealed, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.10 1Pet.1.11">1 Peter 1:10-11</reference> Howbeit, their discoveries were but dark and confused, such
   as men have of things at a great distance, or "in a land that is very
   far off," as the prophet speaks, <reference osisRef="Isa.33.17">Isaiah 33:17</reference> And the continuance
   of this veil on the revelation of the glory of Christ, whilst a veil of
   ignorance and blindness was upon their hearts and minds, proved the
   ruin of that church in its apostasy, as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.7 2Cor.3.13 2Cor.3.14">2 Corinthians 3:7, 13-14</reference> This double veil (the covering covered, the veil
   veiled) God promised to take away, <reference osisRef="Isa.25.7">Isaiah 25:7</reference>; and then shall they
   turn to the Lord, when they shall be able clearly to behold the glory
   of Christ, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.16">2 Corinthians 3:16</reference>
				</p><p>
   But this caused them who were real believers among them to desire,
   long, and pray for, the removal of these veils, the departure of those
   shadows, which made it as night unto them in comparison of what they
   knew would appear, when "the Sun of Righteousness should arise with
   healing in his wings." They thought it long ere "the day did break, and
   the shadows flee away," <reference osisRef="Song.2.17">Song of Solomon 2:17</reference>; iv. 6. There was an apokaradokia,
   as the apostle speaks, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.19">Romans 8:19</reference>, -- a thrusting forth of the head
   with desire and expectation of the exhibition of the Son of God in the
   flesh, and the accomplishment of all divine promises therein. Hence he
   was called the Lord whom they sought and delighted in, <reference osisRef="Mal.3.1">Malachi 3:1</reference>
				</p><p>
   And great was the spiritual wisdom of believers in those days. They
   rejoiced and gloried in the ordinances of divine worship which they did
   enjoy. They looked on them as their chiefest privilege, and attended
   unto them with diligence, as an effect of divine wisdom and love, as
   also because they had a shadow of good things to come. But yet, at the
   same time, they longed and desired that the time of reformation were
   come, wherein they should all be removed; that so they might behold and
   enjoy the good things signified by them. And those who did not so, but
   rested in and trusted unto their present institutions, were not
   accepted with God. Those who were really illuminated did not so, but
   lived in constant desires after the revelation of the whole mystery of
   the wisdom of God in Christ; as did the angels themselves, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.3">1 Peter 1:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:9-10</reference>
				</p><p>
   In this frame of heart and suitable actings of their souls there was
   more of the power of true faith and love than is found among the most
   at this day. They saw the promises afar off, and were persuaded of
   them, and embraced them, <reference osisRef="Heb.11.13">Hebrews 11:13</reference> They reached out the arms of
   their most intent affections to embrace the things that were promised.
   We have an instance of this frame in old Simeon, who, so soon as he had
   taken the child Jesus in his arms, cried out, "Now, Lord, let me
   depart," now let me die; this is that which my soul has longed for,
   <reference osisRef="Luke.2.28 Luke.2.29">Luke 2:28-29</reference>
				</p><p>
   Our present darkness and weakness in beholding the glory of Christ, is
   not like theirs. It is not occasioned by a veil of types and shadows,
   cast on it by the representative institutions of it, -- it does not
   arise from the want of a clear doctrinal revelation of the person and
   office of Christ; but, as was before declared, it proceedeth from two
   other causes. First, From the nature of faith itself, in comparison
   with vision. It is not able to look directly into this excellent glory,
   nor fully to comprehend it. Secondly, From the way of its proposal
   which is not substantial of the thing itself, but only of an image of
   it, as in a glass. But the sight, the view of the glory of Christ,
   which we shall have in heaven, is much more above that which we now
   enjoy by the Gospel, than what we do or may so enjoy is above what they
   have attained under their types and shadows. There is a far greater
   distance between the vision of heaven and the sight which we have now
   by faith, than is between the sight which we now have and what they had
   under the Old Testament. Heaven does more excel the Gospel state than
   that state does the Law. Wherefore, if they did so pray, so long for,
   so desire the removal of their shadows and veils, that they might see
   what we now see, that they might so behold the glory of Christ as we
   may behold it in the light of the Gospel; how much more should we, if
   we have the same faith with them, the same love (which neither will nor
   can be satisfied without perfect fruition), long and pray for the
   removal of all weakness, of all darkness and interposition, that we may
   come unto that immediate beholding of his glory which he so earnestly
   prayed that we might be brought unto!
				</p><p>
   To sum up briefly what has been spoken: There are three things to be
   considered concerning the glory of Christ, three degrees in its
   manifestation, -- the shadow, the perfect image, and the substance
   itself. Those under the Law had only the shadow of it, and of the
   things that belong unto it; -- they had not the perfect image of them,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.10.1">Hebrews 10:1</reference> Under the Gospel we have the perfect image, which they had
   not; or a clear, complete revelation and declaration of it, presenting
   it unto us as in a glass: but the enjoyment of these things in their
   substance is reserved for heaven; we must be "where he is, that we may
   behold his glory." Now, there is a greater difference and distance
   between the real substance of any thing and the most perfect image of
   it, than there is between the most perfect image and the lowest shadow
   of the same thing. If, then, they longed to be freed from their state
   of types and shadows, to enjoy the representation of the glory of
   Christ in that image of it which is given us in the Gospel; much more
   ought we to breathe and pant after our deliverance from beholding it in
   the image of it, that we may enjoy the substance itself. For, whatever
   can be manifest of Christ on this side heaven, it is granted unto us
   for this end, that we may the more fervently desire to be present with
   him.
				</p><p>
   And as it was their wisdom and their grace to rejoice in the light they
   had, and in those typical administrations of divine worship which
   shadowed out the glory of Christ unto them, yet did always pant after
   that more excellent light and full discovery of it which was to be made
   by the Gospel; so it will be ours also thankfully to use and improve
   the revelations which we enjoy of it, and those institutions of worship
   wherein our faith is assisted in the view thereof, -- yet so as
   continually to breathe after that perfect, that glorifying sight of it
   which is reserved for heaven above.
				</p><p>
   And may we not a little examine ourselves by these things? Do we esteem
   this pressing towards the perfect view of the glory of Christ to be our
   duty? and do we abide in the performance of it? If it be otherwise with
   any of us, it is a signal evidence that our profession is hypocritical.
   If Christ be in us, he is the hope of glory in us; and where that hope
   is, it will be active in desires of the things hoped for. Many love the
   world too well, and have their minds too much filled with the things of
   it, to entertain desires of speeding through it unto a state wherein
   they may behold the glory of Christ. They are at home, and are
   unwilling to be absent from the body, though to be present with the
   Lord. They hope, it may be, that such a season will come at one time or
   another, and then it will be the best they can look for when they can
   be here no more. But they have but a little sight of the glory of
   Christ in this world by faith, if any at all, who so little, so faintly
   desire to have the immediate sight of it above. I cannot understand how
   any man can walk with God as he ought, or has that love for Jesus
   Christ which true faith will produce, or does place his refreshments
   and joy in spiritual things, in things above, that does not on all just
   occasions so meditate on the glory of Christ in heaven as to long for
   an admittance into the immediate sight of it.
				</p><p>
   Our Lord Jesus Christ alone perfectly understood wherein the eternal
   blessedness of them that believe in him does consist. And this is the
   sum of what he prays for with respect unto that end, -- namely, that we
   may be where he is, to behold his glory. And is it not our duty to live
   in a continual desire of that which he prayed so earnestly that we
   might attain? If in ourselves we as yet apprehend but little of the
   glory, the excellency, the blessedness of it, yet ought we to repose
   that confidence in the wisdom and love of Christ, that it is our best,
   -- infinitely better than any thing we can enjoy here below.
				</p><p>
   Unto those who are inured unto these contemplations, they are the salt
   of their lives, whereby every thing is condited and made savoury unto
   them, as we shall show afterward. And the want of spiritual diligence
   herein is that which has brought forth a negligent, careless, worldly
   profession of religion, which, countenancing itself with some outward
   duties, has lost out of it the power of faith and love in their
   principal operations. Hereby many deceive their own souls. Goods,
   lands, possessions, relations, trades, with secular interests in them,
   are the things whose image is drawn on their minds, and whose
   characters are written on their foreheads, as the titles whereby they
   may be known. As believers, beholding the glory of Christ in the
   blessed glass of the Gospel, are changed into the same image and
   likeness by the Spirit of the Lord; so these persons, beholding the
   beauty of the world and the things that are in it in the cursed glass
   of self-love, are in their minds changed into the same image. Hence
   perplexing fears, vain hopes, empty embraces of perishing things,
   fruitless desires, earthly, carnal designs, cursed, self-pleasing
   imaginations, feeding on, and being fed by, the love of the world and
   self, do abide and prevail in them. But we have not so learned Christ
   Jesus.

   Another view is taken of the passage, by which a tacit antithesis is
   instituted between katoptron and eikon: "Dominus nos katoptrizei,

<title>Chapter 13 The second difference between our beholding the glory of Christ by faith in this world and by sight in heaven</title>
<p>   Faith is the light wherein we behold the glory of Christ in this world.
   And this in its own nature, as unto this great end, is weak and
   imperfect, like weak eyes, that cannot behold the sun in its beauty.
   Hence our sight of it differs greatly from what we shall enjoy in
   glory, as has been declared. But this is not all; it is frequently
   hindered and interrupted in its operations, or it loses the view of its
   object by one means or other. As he who sees any thing at a great
   distance, sees it imperfectly, and the least interposition or motion
   takes it quite out of his sight, so is it with our faith in this
   matter; whence sometimes we can have little, sometimes no sight at all
   of the glory of Christ by it. And this gives us, as we shall see,
   another difference between faith and sight.
				</p><p>
   Now, although the consideration hereof may seem a kind of diversion
   from our present argument, yet I choose to insist upon it, that I may
   evidence the reasons whence it is that many have so little experience
   of the things whereof we have treated, -- that they find so little of
   reality or power in the exercise of this grace, or the performance of
   this duty. For it will appear in the issue that the whole defect is in
   themselves; -- the truth itself insisted on is great and efficacious.
				</p><p>
   Whilst we are in this life, the Lord Christ is pleased, in his
   sovereign wisdom, sometimes to withdraw, and, as it were, to hide
   himself from us. Then do our minds fall into clouds and darkness; faith
   is at a loss; we cannot behold his glory; yea, we may seek him, but
   cannot find him. So Job complains, as we observed before, "Behold, I go
   forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
   on the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he
   hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him," chap. xxiii.
   8, 9. Which way soever I turn myself, whatever are my endeavours, in
   what way or work of his own I seek him, I cannot find him, I cannot see
   him, -- I cannot behold his glory. So the church also complains,
   "Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the
   Saviour," <reference osisRef="Isa.45.15">Isaiah 45:15</reference>; and the Psalmist, "How long, Lord? wilt thou
   hide thyself for ever?" <reference osisRef="Ps.89.46">Psalms 89:46</reference> This hiding of the face of God
   is the hiding of the shining of his glory in the face of Christ Jesus,
   and therefore of the glory of Christ himself, for it is the glory of
   Christ to be the representative of the glory of God. The spouse in the
   Canticles is often at a loss, and herein bemoans herself, that her
   Beloved was withdrawn, -- that she could neither find him nor see him,
   chap. iii. 1, 2; v. 6.
				</p><p>
   Men may retain their notions concerning Christ, his person and his
   glory. These cannot be blotted out of their minds but by heresy or
   obdurate stupidity. They may have the same doctrinal knowledge of him
   with others; but the sight of his glory does not consist therein. They
   may abide in the outward performance of duties towards him as formerly;
   but yet all this while, as unto the especial gracious communications of
   himself unto their souls, and as unto a cheerful refreshing view of his
   glory, he may withdraw and hide himself from them.
				</p><p>
   As under the same outward dispensations of the Word he does manifest
   himself unto some, and not unto others -- ("how is it that thou wilt
   manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?" <reference osisRef="John.14.22">John 14:22</reference>), --
   whereon they to whom he does so manifest himself do see him to be
   beautiful, glorious, and lovely (for "unto them that believe, he is
   precious"); whilst the others see nothing hereof, but wonder at them by
   whom he is admired, <reference osisRef="Song.5.9">Song of Solomon 5:9</reference>; -- so, in the same dispensation of the
   Word he sometimes hides his face, turns away the light of his
   countenance, clouds the beams of his glory unto some, whilst others are
   cherished and warmed with them.
				</p><p>
   Two things we must here speak unto.
				</p><p>
   1. Why does the Lord Christ, at any time, thus hide himself in his
   glory from the faith of believers, that they cannot behold him?
				</p><p>
   2. How we may perceive and know that he does so withdraw himself from
   us, so that, however we may please ourselves, we do not indeed behold
   his glory.
				</p><p>
   1. As unto the first of these, though what he does is supposed an act
   of sovereign, unaccountable wisdom, yet there are many holy ends of it,
   and consequently reasons for it. I shall mention one only. He does it
   to stir us up in an eminent manner unto a diligent search and inquiry
   after him. Woeful sloth and negligence are apt to prevail in us in our
   meditations on heavenly things. Though our hearts wake (as the spouse
   speaks, <reference osisRef="Song.5.2">Song of Solomon 5:2</reference>), in a valuation of Christ, his love, and his grace,
   yet we sleep as unto the due exercise of faith and love towards him.
   Who is it that can justify himself herein? -- that can say, "My heart
   is pure, I am clean from this sin?" Yea, it is so far otherwise with
   many of us, that he is for ever to be admired in his patience, -- that
   on the account of our unkindness and woeful negligence herein, he has
   not only withdrawn himself at seasons, but that he has not utterly
   departed from us. Now, he knows that those with whom he has been
   graciously present, -- who have had views of his glory, although they
   have not valued the mercy and privilege of it as they ought, yet can
   they not bear a sense of his absence and his hiding himself from them.
   By this, therefore, will he awake them unto a diligent inquiry after
   him. Upon the discovery of his absence, and such a distance of his
   glory from them as their faith cannot reach unto it, they become like
   the doves of the valleys, all of them mourning every one for his
   iniquity, and do stir up themselves to seek him early and with
   diligence. See <reference osisRef="Hos.5.15">Hosea 5:15</reference> So wherever the spouse intimates this
   withdrawing of Christ from her, she immediately gives an account of her
   restless diligence and endeavours in her inquiries after him until she
   have found him, chap. iii. 1-4; v. 2-8. And in these inquiries there is
   such an exercise of faith and love, though it may be acting themselves
   mostly in sighs and groans, as is acceptable and well-pleasing to him.
				</p><p>
   We are like him in the parable of the prophet that spake unto Ahab, who
   having one committed unto him to keep, affirms that whilst he was busy
   here and there, he was gone. Christ commits himself unto us, and we
   ought carefully to keep his presence. "I held him," saith the church,
   "and would not let him go," <reference osisRef="Song.3.4">Song of Solomon 3:4</reference> But whilst we are busy here
   and there, while our minds are overfilled with other things, he
   withdraws himself, -- we cannot find him. But even this rebuke is a
   sanctified ordinance for our recovery, and his return unto us.
				</p><p>
   2. Our second inquiry is, how we may know when Christ does so withdraw
   himself from us, that we do not, that we cannot, behold his glory.
				</p><p>
   I speak herein unto them alone who make this observation of the lively
   actings of faith and love in and towards Jesus Christ their chiefest
   concern in all their retirements, yea, in their whole walk before God.
   Concerning these, our inquiry is, how they may know when Christ does in
   any degree or measure withdraw from them so as that they cannot in a
   due manner behold his glory.
				</p><p>
   And the first discovery hereof is by the consequents of such
   withdrawings. And what are the consequents of it we can know no
   otherwise but by the effects of his presence with us, and the
   manifestation of himself unto us; which, as unto some degrees, must
   necessarily cease thereon.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Now the first of these is the life, vigour, and effectual acting
   of all grace in us. This is an inseparable consequent and effect of a
   view of his glory. Whilst we enjoy it, we live; nevertheless not we,
   but Christ lives in us, exciting and acting all his graces in us.
				</p><p>
   This is that which the apostle instructs us in; while "we behold his
   glory as in a glass, we are transformed into the same image, from glory
   to glory," <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>; -- that is, whilst by faith we contemplate
   on the glory of Christ as revealed in the Gospel, all grace will thrive
   and flourish in us towards a perfect conformity unto him. For whilst we
   abide in this view and contemplation, our souls will be preserved in
   holy frames, and in a continual exercise of love and delight, with all
   other spiritual affections towards him. It is impossible, whilst Christ
   is in the eye of our faith as proposed in the Gospel, but that we shall
   labour to be like him, and greatly love him. Neither is there any way
   for us to attain unto either of these, which are the great concernments
   of our souls, -- namely, to be like unto Christ, and to love him, --
   but by a constant view of him and his glory by faith; which powerfully
   and effectually works them in us. All the doctrinal knowledge which we
   have of him is useless, -- all the view we have of his glory is but
   fancy, imagination, or superstition, which are not accompanied with
   this transforming power. And that which is wrought by it, is the
   increase and vigour of all grace; for therein alone our conformity unto
   him does consist. Growth in grace, holiness, and obedience, is a
   growing like unto Christ; and nothing else is so.
				</p><p>
   I cannot refrain here from a necessary short digression. This
   transforming efficacy, from a spiritual view of Christ as proposed in
   the Gospel, being lost, as unto an experience of it, in the minds of
   men carnal and ignorant of the mystery of believing (as it is at
   present by many derided, though it be the life of religion), fancy and
   superstition provided various supplies in the room of it. For they
   found out crucifixes and images with paintings to represent him in his
   sufferings and glory. By these things, their carnal affections being
   excited by their outward senses, they suppose themselves to be affected
   with him, and to be like unto him. Yea, some have proceeded so far as,
   either by arts diabolical, or by other means, to make an appearance of
   wounds on their hands, and feet, and sides; therein pretending to be
   like him, -- yea, to be wholly transformed into his image. But that
   which is produced by an image is but an image. An imaginary Christ will
   effect nothing in the minds of men but imaginary grace.
				</p><p>
   Thus religion was lost, and died. When men could not obtain any
   experience in their minds of the spiritual mysteries of the Gospel, nor
   be sensible of any spiritual change or advantage by them, they
   substituted some outward duties and observances in their stead; as I
   shall show, God willing, elsewhere more at large. These produced some
   kind of effects on their minds and affections, but quite of another
   nature than those which are the real effects of true evangelical grace.
   This is openly evident in this substitution of images instead of the
   representation of Christ and his glory made in the Gospel.
				</p><p>
   However, there is a general supposition granted on all hands, --
   namely, that there must be a view of Christ and his glory, to cause us
   to love him, and thereby to make us conformable or like unto him. But
   here lies the difference:  those of the Church of Rome say that this
   must be done by the beholding of crucifixes, with other images and
   pictures of him; and that with our bodily eyes: we say it is by our
   beholding his glory by faith, as revealed in the Gospel, and no
   otherwise. And, to confess the truth, we have some who, as they reject
   the use of images, so they despise that spiritual view of the glory of
   Christ which we inquire after. Such persons on the first occasion will
   fall on the other side; for anything is better than nothing.
				</p><p>
   But, as we have a sure word of prophecy to secure us from these
   abominations, by an express prohibition of such images unto all ends
   whatever; so, unto our stability in the profession of the truth, an
   experience of the efficacy of this spiritual view of Christ
   transforming our souls into his own likeness, is absolutely necessary.
   For if an idolater should plead, as they do all, that in the beholding
   of the image of Christ, or of a crucifix, especially if they are
   sedulous and constant therein, they find their affections unto him
   greatly excited, increased, and inflamed (as they will be, <reference osisRef="Isa.57.5">Isaiah 57:5</reference>); and that hereon he endeavours to be like unto him; what shall we
   have to oppose thereunto? For it is certain that such images are apt to
   make impressions on the minds of men; partly from the readiness of the
   senses and imagination to give them admittance into their thoughts; and
   partly from their natural inclinations unto superstition, their
   aversion from things spiritual and invisible, with an inclination unto
   things present and visible. Hence among them who are satisfied that
   they ought not to be adored with any religious veneration, yet some are
   apt, upon the sight of them, to entertain a thoughtful reverence, as
   they would do if they were to enter into a Pagan temple full of idols;
   and others are continually making approaches towards their use and
   veneration, in paintings, and altars, and such outward postures of
   worship as are used in the religious service of them. But that they do
   sensibly affect the minds of men carnal and superstitious, cannot be
   denied; and as they suppose, it is with a love unto Christ himself.
   However, certain it is in general, and confessed on all hands, that the
   beholding of Christ is the most blessed means of exciting all our
   graces, spiritualizing all our affections, and transforming our minds
   into his likeness. And if we have not another, and that a more
   excellent way of beholding him, than they have who behold him, as they
   suppose, in images and crucifixes, they would seem to have the
   advantage of us; for their minds will really be affected with somewhat,
   ours with nothing at all. And by the pretence thereof, they inveigle
   the carnal affections of men ignorant of the power of the Gospel, to
   become their proselytes. For having lived, it may be, a long time
   without any the least experience of a sensible impression on their
   minds, or a transforming power from the representation of Christ in the
   Gospel, upon their very first religious, devout application unto these
   images, they find their thoughts exercised, their minds affected, and
   some present change made upon them.
				</p><p>
   But there was a difference between the person of David and an image
   with a bolster of goat's hair, though the one were laid in the room and
   place of the other; and there is so between Christ and an image, though
   the one be put into the place of the other. Neither do these things
   serve unto any other end, but to divert the minds of men from faith and
   love to Christ; -- giving them some such satisfactions in the room of
   them, as that their carnal affections do cleave unto their idols. And
   indeed it does belong unto the wisdom of faith, or we stand in need of
   spiritual light, to discern and judge between the working of natural
   affections towards spiritual objects, on undue motives by undue means
   with indirect ends, -- wherein all Papal devotion consists, -- and the
   spiritual exercise of grace in those affections duly fixed on spiritual
   objects.
				</p><p>
   But, as was said, it is a real experience of the efficacy that there is
   in the spiritual beholding of the glory of Christ by faith, as proposed
   in the Gospel, to strengthen, increase, and excite all grace unto its
   proper exercise, so changing and transforming the soul gradually into
   his likeness, which must secure us against all those pretences; and so
   I return from this digression.
				</p><p>
   Hereby we may understand whether the Lord does so withdraw himself as
   that we do not, as that we cannot, behold his glory by faith in a due
   manner; -- which is the thing inquired after. For if we grow weak in
   our graces, unspiritual in our frames, cold in our affections, or
   negligent in the exercise of them by holy meditation, it is evident
   that he is at a great distance from us, so as that we do not behold his
   glory as we ought. If the weather grow cold, herbs and plants do
   wither, and the frost begins to bind up the earth, all men grant that
   the sun is withdrawn, and makes not his wonted approach unto us. And if
   it be so with our hearts, that they grow cold, frozen, withering,
   lifeless, in and unto spiritual duties, it is certain that the Lord
   Christ is in some sense withdrawn, and that we do not behold his glory.
   We retain notions of truth concerning his person, office, and grace;
   but faith is not in constant exercise as to real views of him and his
   glory. For there is nothing more certain in Christian experience than
   this is, that while we do really by faith behold the glory of Christ,
   as proposed in the Gospel, the glory of his person and office, as
   before described, and so abide in holy thoughts and meditations
   thereof, especially in our private duties and retirements, all grace
   will live and thrive in us in some measure, especially love unto his
   person, and therein unto all that belongs unto him. Let us but put it
   to the trial, and we shall infallibly find the promised event.
				</p><p>
   Do any of us find decays in grace prevailing in us; -- deadness,
   coldness, lukewarmness, a kind of spiritual stupidity and senselessness
   coming upon us? Do we find an unreadiness unto the exercise of grace in
   its proper season, and the vigorous acting of it in duties of communion
   with God, and would we have our souls recovered from these dangerous
   diseases? Let us assure ourselves there is no better way for our
   healing and deliverance, yea, no other way but this alone, -- namely,
   the obtaining a fresh view of the glory of Christ by faith, and a
   steady abiding therein. Constant contemplation of Christ and his glory,
   putting forth its transforming power unto the revival of all grace, is
   the only relief in this case; as shall farther be showed afterward.
				</p><p>
   Some will say, that this must be effected by fresh supplies and renewed
   communications of the Holy Spirit. Unless he fall as dew and showers on
   our dry and barren hearts, -- unless he cause our graces to spring,
   thrive, and bring forth fruit, -- unless he revive and increase faith,
   love, and holiness in our souls, -- our backslidings will not be
   healed, nor our spiritual state be recovered. Unto this end is he
   prayed for and promised in the Scripture. See <reference osisRef="Song.4.16">Song of Solomon 4:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.44.3 Isa.44.4">Isaiah 44:3-4</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ezek.11.19">Ezekiel 11:19</reference>; xxxvi. 26; <reference osisRef="Hos.14.5 Hos.14.6">Hosea 14:5-6</reference> And so it is. The
   immediate efficiency of the revival of our souls is from and by the
   Holy Spirit. But the inquiry is, in what way, or by what means, we may
   obtain the supplies and communications of him unto this end. This the
   apostle declares in the place insisted on: We, beholding the glory of
   Christ in a glass, "are changed into the same image, from glory to
   glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord." It is in the exercise of faith
   on Christ, in the way before described, that the Holy Spirit puts forth
   his renewing, transforming power in and upon our souls. This,
   therefore, is that alone which will retrieve Christians from their
   present decays and deadness.
				</p><p>
   Some complain greatly of their state and condition; none so dead, so
   dull and stupid as they; -- they know not whether they have any spark
   of heavenly life left in them. Some make weak and faint endeavours for
   a recovery, which are like the attempts of a man in a dream, wherein he
   seems to use great endeavours without any success. Some put themselves
   unto multiplied duties. Howbeit, the generality of professors seem to
   be in a pining, thriftless condition. And the reason of it is, because
   they will not sincerely and constantly make use of the only remedy and
   relief; like a man that will rather choose to pine away in his sickness
   with some useless, transient refreshments, than apply himself unto a
   known and approved remedy, because, it may be, the use of it is
   unsuited unto some of his present occasions. Now this is, to live in
   the exercise of faith in Christ Jesus. This himself assures us of, <reference osisRef="John.15.4 John.15.5">John 15:4-5</reference>, "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
   of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
   in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I
   in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do
   nothing."
				</p><p>
   There is a twofold coming unto Christ by believing. The first is that
   we may have life; -- that is, a spring and principle of spiritual life
   communicated unto us from him: for he is "our life," <reference osisRef="Col.3.4">Colossians 3:4</reference>, and
   "because he liveth, we live also," <reference osisRef="John.14.19">John 14:19</reference> Yea, it is not so much
   we that live, as he liveth in us, <reference osisRef="Gal.2.19 Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:19-20</reference> And unbelief is a
   not coming unto him, that we may have life, <reference osisRef="John.5.40">John 5:40</reference> But, secondly,
   there is also a coming unto him by believers in the actual exercise of
   faith, that they may "have this life more abundantly," <reference osisRef="John.10.10">John 10:10</reference>; that
   is, such supplies of grace as may keep their souls in a healthy,
   vigorous acting of all the powers of spiritual life. And as he
   reproacheth some that they would not come unto him that they might have
   life, so he may justly reprove us all, that we do not so come unto him
   in the actual exercise of faith, as that we might have this life more
   abundantly.
				</p><p>
   (2.) When the Lord Christ is near us, and we do behold his glory, he
   will frequently communicate spiritual refreshment in peace,
   consolation, and joy unto our souls. We shall not only hereby have our
   graces excited with respect unto him as their object, but be made
   sensible of his actings toward us in the communications of himself and
   his love unto us. When the Sun of Righteousness ariseth on any soul, or
   makes any near approach thereunto, it shall find "healing under his
   wings;" -- his beams of grace shall convey by his Spirit holy spiritual
   refreshment thereunto. For he is present with us by his Spirit, and
   these are his fruits and effects, as he is the Comforter, suited unto
   his office, as he is promised unto us.
				</p><p>
   Many love to walk in a very careless, unwise profession. So long as
   they can hold out in the performance of outward duties, they are very
   regardless of the greatest evangelical privileges, -- of those things
   which are the marrow of divine promises, -- all real endeavours of a
   vital communion with Christ. Such are spiritual peace, refreshing
   consolations, ineffable joys, and the blessed composure of assurance.
   Without some taste and experience of these things, profession is
   heartless, lifeless, useless; and religion itself a dead carcass
   without an animating soul. The peace which some enjoy is a mere
   stupidity. They judge not these things to be real which are the
   substance of Christ's present reward; and a renunciation whereof would
   deprive the church of its principal supportments and encouragements in
   all its sufferings. It is a great evidence of the power of unbelief,
   when we can satisfy ourselves without an experience in our own hearts
   of the great things, in this kind of joy, peace, consolation,
   assurance, that are promised in the Gospels. For how can it be supposed
   that we do indeed believe the promises of things future, -- namely, of
   heaven, immortality, and glory, the faith whereof is the foundation of
   all religions, -- when we do not believe the promises of the present
   reward in these spiritual privileges? And how shall we be thought to
   believe them, when we do not endeavour after an experience of the
   things themselves in our own souls, but are even contented without
   them? But herein men deceive themselves. They would very desirously
   have evangelical joy, peace, and assurance, to countenance them in
   their evil frames and careless walking. And some have attempted to
   reconcile these things, unto the ruin of their souls. But it will not
   be. Without the diligent exercise of the grace of obedience, we shall
   never enjoy the grace of consolation. But we must speak somewhat of
   these things afterward.
				</p><p>
   It is peculiarly in the view of the glory of Christ, in his approaches
   unto us, and abiding with us, that we are made partakers of evangelical
   peace, consolation, joy, and assurances. These are a part of the royal
   train of his graces, of the reward wherewith he is accompanied. "His
   reward is with him." Wherever he is graciously present with any, these
   things are never wanting in a due measure and degree, unless it be by
   their own fault, or for their trial. In these things does he give the
   church of his loves, <reference osisRef="Song.7.12">Song of Solomon 7:12</reference> "For if any man," saith he, "love
   me, I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him," <reference osisRef="John.14.21">John 14:21</reference>;
   -- "yea, I and the Father will come unto him, and make our abode with
   him," verse 23; and that so as to "sup with him," <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference>; --
   which, on his part, can be only by the communication of those spiritual
   refreshments. The only inquiry is, by what way and means we do receive
   them? Now, I say this is in and by our beholding of the glory of Christ
   by faith, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.8 1Pet.1.9">1 Peter 1:8-9</reference> Let that glory be rightly stated, as before
   laid down, -- the glory of his person, his office, his condescension,
   exaltation, love, and grace; let faith be fixed in a view and
   contemplation of it, mix itself with it, as represented in the glass of
   the Gospel, meditate upon it, embrace it, -- and virtue will proceed
   from Christ, communicating spiritual, supernatural refreshment and joy
   unto our souls. Yea, in ordinary cases, it is impossible that believers
   should have a real prospect of this glory at any time, but that it will
   in some measure affect their hearts with a sense of his love; which is
   the spring of all consolation in them. In the exercise of faith on the
   discoveries of the glory of Christ made unto us in the Gospel, no man
   shall ever totally want such intimations of his love, yea, such
   effusion of it in his heart, as shall be a living spring of those
   spiritual refreshments, <reference osisRef="John.4.14">John 4:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.5.5">Romans 5:5</reference> When, therefore, we
   lose these things, as unto a sense of them in our souls, it is evident
   that the Lord Christ is withdrawn, and that we do not behold his glory.
				</p><p>
   But I cannot here avoid another short digression. There are those by
   whom all these things are derided as distempered fancies and
   imaginations; yea, such things have been spoken and written of them as
   contain a virtual renunciation of the Gospel, the powers of the world
   to come, and the whole work of the Holy Ghost as the comforter of the
   church. And hereby all real intercourse between the person of Christ
   and the souls of them that do believe is utterly overthrown; --
   reducing all religion to an outward show, and a pageantry fitter for a
   stage than that temple of God which is in the minds of men. According
   unto the sentiments of these profane scoffers, there is no such thing
   as the shedding abroad of the love of God in our hearts by the Holy
   Ghost, nor as the witnessing of the Spirit of God with our spirits that
   we are the children of God, from which these spiritual joys and
   refreshments are inseparable as their necessary effects; -- no such
   thing as the lifting up of the light of God's countenance upon us,
   which will put gladness into our hearts, that gladness which compriseth
   all the things mentioned; -- no such thing as rejoicing upon
   "believing, with joy unspeakable and full of glory;" -- no such thing
   as Christ's showing and manifesting himself unto us, supping with us,
   and giving us of his loves; -- that the divine promises of a "feast of
   fat things, and wine well refined," in gospel mercies, are empty and
   insignificant words; -- that all those ravishing joys and exultations
   of spirit that multitudes of faithful martyrs of old and in later ages
   have enjoyed, by a view of the glory of God in Christ and a sense of
   his love, whereunto they gave testimony unto their last moments in the
   midst of their torments, were but fancies and imaginations. But it is
   the height of impudence in these profane scoffers, that they proclaim
   their own ignorance of those things which are the real powers of our
   region.
				</p><p>
   Others there are who will not deny the truth of these things. They dare
   not rise up in contradiction unto those express testimonies of the
   Scripture wherewith they are confirmed. And they do suppose that some
   are partakers of them, at least there were so formerly; but as for
   their parts, they have no experience of them, nor do judge it their
   duty to endeavour after it. They can make a shift to live on hopes of
   heaven and future glory; as unto what is present, they desire no more,
   but to be found in the performance of some duties in answer unto their
   convictions, -- which gives them that sorry peace which they do enjoy.
   So do many countenance themselves in their spiritual sloth and
   unbelief, keeping themselves at liberty to seek for refreshment and
   satisfaction in other things, whilst those of the Gospel are despised.
   And these things are inconsistent. While men look for their chief
   refreshment and satisfaction in temporal things, it is impossible they
   should seek after those that are spiritual in a due manner. And it must
   be confessed, that when we have a due regard unto spiritual,
   evangelical consolations and joys, it will abate and take off our
   affections unto, and satisfaction in, present enjoyments, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8 Phil.3.9">Philippians 3:8-9</reference>
				</p><p>
   But there is no more sacred truth than this, that where Christ is
   present with believers, -- where he is not withdrawn for a season from
   them, where they live in the view of his glory by faith as it is
   proposed unto them in the Gospel, -- he will give unto them, at his own
   seasons such intimations of his love, such supplies of his Spirit, such
   holy joys and rejoicings, such repose of soul in assurance, as shall
   refresh their souls, fill them with joy, satisfy them with spiritual
   delight, and quicken them unto all acts of holy communion with himself.
				</p><p>
   Let no such dishonour be reflected on the Gospel, that whereas the
   faith of it, and obedience unto it, are usually accompanied with
   outward troubles, afflictions, persecution, and reproaches, as we are
   foretold they should be, -- that it does not by its inward consolations
   and divine refreshments, outbalance all those evils which we may
   undergo upon the account of it. So to suppose, is expressly contrary to
   the promise of Christ himself, who has assured us that even nun en to
   kairo touto, "even now in this life," in this world, distinct from
   eternal life in the world to come, we shall receive a hundred-fold
   recompense for all that we can lose or suffer for his sake, <reference osisRef="Mark.10.30">Mark 10:30</reference>;
   -- as also unto the experience of them who, in all ages, have "taken
   joyfully the spoiling of their goods, as knowing in themselves" (by the
   experience which they have of its first-fruits) that they "have in
   heaven a better and an enduring substance," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.34">Hebrews 10:34</reference> If we come
   short in a participation of these things, if we are strangers unto
   them, the blame is to be laid on ourselves alone, as it shall be
   immediately declared.
				</p><p>
   Now, the design of the Lord Christ, in thus withdrawing himself from
   us, and hiding his glory from our view, being the exercise of our
   grace, and to stir us up unto diligence in our inquiries after him,
   here lieth our guidance and direction in this case. Do we find
   ourselves lifeless in the spiritual duties of religion? Are we
   strangers unto the heavenly visits of consolation and joys, -- those
   visitations of God whereby he preserves our souls? Do we seldom enjoy a
   sense of the "shedding abroad of his love in our hearts by the Holy
   Ghost?" We have no way of recovery but this alone, -- to this "strong
   tower" must we turn ourselves as "prisoners of hope," -- unto Christ
   must we look, that we may be saved. It is a steady view or
   contemplation of his glory by faith alone that will bring in all these
   things in a lively experience into our hearts and souls.
				</p><p>
   Again, in the second place, it is from ourselves principally, if we
   lose the view of the glory of Christ, and the exercise of faith be
   obstructed therein. All our spiritual disadvantages do arise from
   ourselves. It is the remainder of lusts and corruptions in us, either
   indulged by sloth and negligence or excited and inflamed by Satan's
   temptations, that do obstruct us in this duty. Whilst they are in any
   disorder or disturbance, it is in vain for us to expect any clear view
   of this glory.
				</p><p>
   That view of the glory of Christ whereof we treat consists in two
   things, -- namely, its especial nature, and its necessary adjunct or
   effect. The first is, a spiritual perception or understanding of it as
   revealed in the Scriptures. For the revelation of the glory of his
   person, office, and grace, is the principal subject of them, and the
   principal object of our faith. And the other consists in multiplied
   thoughts about him, with actings of faith, in love, trust, delight, and
   longing after the full enjoyment of him, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.8">1 Peter 1:8</reference> If we satisfy
   ourselves in mere notions and speculations about the glory of Christ as
   doctrinally revealed unto us, we shall find no transforming power or
   efficacy communicated unto us thereby. But when, under the conduct of
   that spiritual light, our affections do cleave unto him with full
   purpose of heart, our minds are filled with the thoughts of him and
   delight in him, and faith is kept up unto its constant exercise in
   trust and affiance on him, -- virtue will proceed from him to purify
   our hearts, increase our holiness, strengthen our graces, and to fill
   us sometimes "with joy unspeakable and full of glory." This is the just
   temperature of a state of spiritual health, -- namely, when our light
   of the knowledge of the glory of God in Christ does answer the means of
   it which we enjoy, and when our affections unto Christ do hold
   proportion unto that light; and this according unto the various degrees
   of it, -- for some have more, and some have less. Where light leaves
   the affections behind, it ends in formality or atheism; and where
   affections outrun light, they sink in the bog of superstition, doting
   on images and pictures, or the like. But where things go not into these
   excesses, it is better that our affections exceed our light from the
   defect of our understandings, than that our light exceed our affections
   from the corruption of our wills. In both these is the exercise of
   faith frequently interrupted and obstructed by the remainder of
   corruption in us, especially if not kept constantly under the
   discipline of mortification, but some way indulged unto. For, --
				</p><p>
   First, The steam of their disorder will cloud and darken the
   understanding, that it shall not be able clearly to discern any
   spiritual object, -- least of all the greatest of them. There is
   nothing more acknowledged, even in things natural and moral, than that
   the disorder of the passions and affections will blind, darken, and
   deceive the mind in its operations. And it is much more so in things
   spiritual, wherein that disorder is an immediate rebellion against its
   proper conducting light; that is, against the light and rule of grace.
				</p><p>
   There are three sorts of them unto whom the Gospel is preached, in whom
   there are various obstructions of this view.
				</p><p>
   1. There is in obstinate unbelievers a darkness, that is an effect of
   the power of Satan on their minds, in blinding them, which makes it
   impossible for them to behold any thing of the glory of Christ. So the
   apostle declares it, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are
   lost: in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which
   believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
   the image of God, should shine unto them," <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.3 2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</reference> Of these we
   do not speak.
				</p><p>
   2. There is in all men a corrupt, natural darkness; or such a
   depravation of their minds by nature, as that they cannot discern this
   glory of Christ in a due manner. Hence "the light shineth in darkness;
   and the darkness comprehended it not," <reference osisRef="John.1.5">John 1:5</reference> For "the natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness
   unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
   discerned," <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.14">1 Corinthians 2:14</reference> Hence it is, that although Christ be
   preached among us continually, yet there are very few who discern any
   glory or beauty in him for which he should be desired, as the prophet
   complains, <reference osisRef="Isa.53.1 Isa.53.2">Isaiah 53:1-2</reference> But I speak not of this natural darkness in
   general. But even these persons have their minds filled with prejudices
   against the Gospel, and darkened as unto the glory of Christ, according
   as corrupt lusts and affections are prevalent in them. See <reference osisRef="John.1.46">John 1:46</reference>;
   xii. 43. Hence is the difference that is among the common hearers of
   the Word. For although no man can do any thing of himself for the
   receiving of Christ and the beholding of his glory, without the
   especial aid of the grace of God (<reference osisRef="Matt.11.25">Matthew 11:25</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.6.44 John.6.45">John 6:44-45</reference>), yet
   some may make more opposition unto believing, and lay more hindrances
   in their own way, than others; which is done by their lusts and
   corruptions.
				</p><p>
   3. There are those in whom both these evils are cured by faith, wherein
   the eyes of our understandings are enlightened to perceive and discern
   spiritual things, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.16 Eph.1.17 Eph.1.18">Ephesians 1:16-18</reference> But this cure is wrought in this life
   but in part, <reference osisRef="1Cor.13.12">1 Corinthians 13:12</reference> And in this cure, by a supply of a
   principle of saving light unto our minds, there are many degrees. For
   some have a clearer light than others, and thereby a more clear
   discerning of the mystery of the wisdom of God, and of the glory of
   Christ therein. But whatever be our attainments herein, that which
   obstructs this light, which hinders it from shining in a due manner, --
   that obstructs and hinders faith in its view of the glory of Christ.
   And this is done by the remainders of corrupted nature in us, when they
   act in any prevalent degree. For they darken the mind, and weaken it in
   its spiritual operations. That is, where any corrupt and inordinate
   affections, as love of the world, cares about it, inclinations unto
   sensuality, or the like spiritual disorders, do prevail, faith is
   weakened in its spiritual acts, especially in discerning and beholding
   the glory of Christ. For the mind is rendered unsteady in its inquiries
   after it, being continually distracted and diverted with vain thoughts
   and imaginations.
				</p><p>
   Persons under the power of such distempers may have the same doctrinal
   knowledge of the person of Christ, his office, and his grace, with
   other men, and the same evidence of its truth fixed on their minds; but
   when they endeavour a real intuition into the things themselves, all
   things are dark and confused unto them, from the uncertainty and
   instability of their own minds.
				</p><p>
   This is the sum of what I do design. We have by faith a view of the
   glory of Christ. This view is weak and unsteady, from the nature of
   faith itself, and the way of its proposal unto us -- as in a glass, in
   comparison of what by sight we shall attain unto. But, moreover, where
   corrupt lusts or inordinate affections are indulged unto, where they
   are not continually mortified, where any one sin has a perplexing
   prevalence in the mind, faith will be so far weakened thereby, as that
   it can neither see nor meditate upon this glory of Christ in a due
   manner. This is the reason why the most are so weak and unstable in the
   performance of this duty; yea, are almost utterly unacquainted with it.
   The light of faith in the minds of men being impaired, clouded,
   darkened, by the prevalence of unmortified lusts, it cannot make such
   discoveries of this glory as otherwise it would do. And this makes the
   preaching of Christ unto many so unprofitable as it is.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, In the view of the glory of Christ which we have by faith, it
   will fill the mind with thoughts and meditations about him, whereon the
   affections will cleave unto him with delight. This, as was said, is
   inseparable from a spiritual view of his glory in its due exercise.
   Every one that has it, must and will have many thoughts concerning, and
   great affections to him. See the description of these things, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8 Phil.3.9 Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:8-10</reference> It is not possible, I say, that we should behold the glory
   of his person, office, and grace, with a due conviction of our
   concernment and interest therein, but that our minds will be greatly
   affected with it, and be filled with contemplations about it. Where it
   is not so with any, it is to be feared that they "have not heard his
   voice at any time, nor seen his shape," whatever they profess. A
   spiritual sight of Christ will assuredly produce love unto him; and if
   any man love him not, he never saw him, -- he knows him not at all. And
   that is no love which does not beget in us many thoughts of the object
   beloved. He, therefore, who is partaker of this grace, will think much
   of what Christ is in himself, -- of what he has done for us, -- of his
   love and condescension, -- of the manifestation of all the glorious
   excellencies of the divine nature in him, exerted in a way of infinite
   wisdom and goodness for the salvation of the church. Thoughts and
   meditations of these things will abound in us, if we are not wanting
   unto the due exercise of faith; and intense, inflamed affections unto
   him will ensue thereon; at least they will be active unto our own
   refreshing experience. And where these things are not in reality
   (though in some they may be only in a mean and low degree), men do but
   deceive their own souls in hopes of any benefit by Christ or the
   Gospel.
				</p><p>
   This, therefore, is the present case:  Where there are prevailing
   sinful distempers or inordinate affections in the mind, such as those
   before mentioned, -- as self-love, love of the world, cares and fears
   about it, with an excessive valuation of relations and enjoyments, --
   they will so far cumber and perplex it with a multitude of thoughts
   about their own objects, as shall leave no place for sedate meditations
   on Christ and his glory. And where the thoughts are engaged, the
   affections, which partly excite them and partly are led by them, will
   be fixed also, <reference osisRef="Col.3.1 Col.3.2">Colossians 3:1-2</reference>
				</p><p>
   This is that which, in the most, greatly promoteth that imperfection
   which is in our view of the glory of Christ by faith, in this life.
   According to the proportion and degree of the prevalence of affections,
   corrupt, earthly, selfish, or sensual, filling the heads and hearts of
   men with a multitude of thoughts about what they are fixed on or
   inclined unto; so is faith obstructed and weakened in this work and
   duty.
				</p><p>
   Wherefore, whereas there is a remainder of these lusts, as to the seeds
   of them, in us all, -- though more mortified in some than in others,
   yet having the same effects in the minds of all, according to the
   degree of their remainder, -- thence it is, as from an efficacious
   cause of it, that our view of the glory of Christ by faith is in many
   so weak, imperfect and unsteady.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly, We have interruption given unto the work of faith herein by
   the temptations of Satan. His original great design, wherever the
   gospel is preached, is to blind the eyes of men, that the light of the
   glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine
   unto them, or irradiate their minds, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:4</reference> And herein he
   prevails unto astonishment. Let the light of the gospel in the
   preaching of the Word be never so glorious, yet, by various means and
   artifices, he blinds the minds of the most, that they shall not behold
   any thing of the glory of Christ therein. By this means he continues
   his rule in the children of disobedience. With respect unto the elect,
   God overpowers him herein. He shines into their hearts, to give them
   the knowledge of his glory in the face of Christ Jesus, verse 6. Yet
   will not Satan so give over. He will endeavour by all ways and means to
   trouble, discompose, and darken the minds even of them that believe, so
   as that they shall not be able to retain clear and distinct views of
   this glory. And this he does in two ways.
				</p><p>
   1. With some he employs all his engines, uses all his methods of
   serpentine subtlety, and casts in his fiery darts so to disquiet,
   discompose, and deject them, as that they can retain no comfortable
   views of Christ or his glory. Hence arise fears, doubts, disputes,
   uncertainties, with various disconsolations. Hereon they cannot
   apprehend the love of Christ, nor be sensible of any interest they have
   therein, or any refreshing persuasions that they are accepted with him.
   If such things sometimes shine and beam into their minds, yet they
   quickly vanish and disappear. Fears that they are rejected and cast off
   by him, that he will not receive them here nor hereafter, do come in
   their place; hence are they filled with anxieties and despondencies,
   under which it is impossible they should have any clear view of his
   glory.
				</p><p>
   I know that ignorance, atheism, and obstinate security in sensual sins,
   do combine to despise all these things. But it is no new thing in the
   world, that men outwardly professing Christian religion, when they find
   gain in that godliness, should speak evil of the things which they know
   not, and corrupt themselves in what they know naturally, as brute
   beasts.
				</p><p>
   2. With others he deals after another manner. By various means he
   seduceth them into a careless security, wherein they promise peace unto
   themselves without any diligent search into these things. Hereon they
   live in a general presumption that they shall be saved by Christ,
   although they know not how. This makes the apostle so earnest in
   pressings the duty of self-examination on all Christians, <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.5">2 Corinthians 13:5</reference>, "Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
   selves: know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,
   except ye be reprobates?" The rule of self-judging prescribed by him
   is, whether Christ be in us or no; and in us he cannot be, unless he be
   received by that faith wherewith we behold his glory. For by faith we
   receive him, and by faith he dwelleth in our hearts, <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.3.17">Ephesians 3:17</reference>
				</p><p>
   This is the principal way of his prevailing in the world. Multitudes by
   his seduction live in great security under the utmost neglect of these
   things. Security is granted to be an evil destructive of the souls of
   men; but then it is supposed to consist only in impenitency for great
   and open sins: but to be neglective of endeavouring an experience of
   the power and grace of the gospel in our own souls, under a profession
   of religion, is no less destructive and pernicious than impenitency in
   any course of sin.
				</p><p>
   These and the like obstructions unto faith in its operations being
   added unto its own imperfections, are another cause whence our view of
   the glory of Christ in this world is weak and unsteady; so that, for
   the most part, it does but transiently affect our minds, and not so
   fully transform them into his likeness as otherwise it would.
				</p><p>
   It is now time to consider that sight which we shall have of the glory
   of Christ in heaven, in comparison of that which we have here below.
   Now this is equal, stable, always the same, -- without interruption or
   diversion. And this is evident, both in the causes or means of it, as
   also in our perfect deliverance from every thing that might be a
   hindrance in it, or an obstruction unto it.
				</p><p>
   1. We may consider the state of our minds in glory. The faculties of
   our souls shall then be made perfect, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.23">Hebrews 12:23</reference>, "The spirits of
   just men made perfect." (1.) Freed from all the clogs of the flesh, and
   all its influence upon them, and restraint of their powers in their
   operations. (2.) Perfectly purified from all principles of instability
   and variety, -- of all inclinations unto things sensual and carnal, and
   all contrivances of self-preservation or advancement, -- being wholly
   transformed into the image of God in spirituality and holiness. And to
   take in the state of our bodies after the resurrection; even they also,
   in all their powers and senses, shall be made entirely subservient unto
   the most spiritual actings of our minds in their highest elevation by
   the light of glory. Hereby shall we be enabled and fitted eternally to
   abide in the contemplation of the glory of Christ with joy and
   satisfaction. The understanding shall be always perfected with the
   vision of God, and the affections cleave inseparably to him; -- which
   is blessedness.
				</p><p>
   The very essential faculties of our souls, in that way and manner of
   working which, by their union with our bodies, they are confined unto,
   are not able to comprehend and abide constantly in the contemplation of
   this glory. So that, though our sight of it here be dim and imperfect,
   and the proposal of it obscure; yet, from the weakness of our minds, we
   are forced sometimes to turn aside from what we do discern, as we do
   our bodily eyes from the beams of the sun when it shines in its
   brightness. But in this perfect state they are able to behold and
   delight in this glory constantly with eternal satisfaction.
				</p><p>
   But "as for me," saith David, "I will behold thy face in righteousness:
   I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness," <reference osisRef="Ps.17.15">Psalms 17:15</reference>
   It is Christ alone who is the likeness and image of God. When we awake
   in the other world, with our minds purified and rectified, the
   beholding of him shall be always satisfying unto us. There will be then
   no satiety, no weariness, no indispositions; but the mind, being made
   perfect in all its faculties, powers, and operations, with respect unto
   its utmost end, which is the enjoyment of God, is satisfied in the
   beholding of him for evermore. And where there is perfect satisfaction
   without satiety, there is blessedness for ever. So the Holy Spirit
   affirms of the four living creatures, in the Revelation, "They rest not
   day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty," chap. iv.
   8. They are continually exercised in the admiration and praises of God
   in Christ without weariness or interruption. Herein shall we be made
   like unto angels.
				</p><p>
   2. As our minds, in their essential powers and faculties, shall be
   enabled to comprehend and acquiesce in this glory of Christ; so the
   means or instrument of the beholding of it is much more excellent than
   faith, and in its kind absolutely perfect; as has in part been before
   declared. This is vision or sight. Here we walk by faith; there, by
   sight. And this sight is not an external aid, like a glass helping the
   weakness of the visive faculty to see things afar off; but it is an
   internal power, or an act of the internal power of our minds, where
   with they are endowed in a glorified state. Hereby we shall be able to
   "see him face to face, -- to see him as he is," in a direct
   comprehension of his glory; for this sight or visive power shall be
   given us for this very end, -- namely, to enable us so to do. Hereunto
   the whole glory of Christ is clear, perspicuous, and evident; which
   will give us eternal acquiescence therein. Hence shall our sight of the
   glory of Christ be invariable and always the same.
				</p><p>
   3. The Lord Christ will never, in any one instance, on any occasion, so
   much as one moment, withdraw himself from us, or eclipse the proposal
   and manifestation of himself unto our sight. This he does sometimes in
   this life; and it is needful for us that so he should do. "We shall
   ever be with the Lord," <reference osisRef="1Thess.4.17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</reference>, -- without end, without
   interruption. This is the centre of good and evil as to the future
   different states of men. They shall be for ever. Eternity makes them
   absolutely good on the one hand, and absolutely evil on the other. To
   be in hell under the wrath of God is in itself the greatest penal evil;
   but to be there for ever, without the intermission of misery or
   determination of time, is that which renders it the greatest evil unto
   them who shall be in that condition. So is eternity the life of future
   blessedness. "We shall ever be with the Lord," without limitation of
   time, without interruption of enjoyment.
				</p><p>
   There are no vicissitudes in the heavenly state. The new Jerusalem has
   no temple in it; "for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple
   thereof," <reference osisRef="Rev.21.22">Revelation of John 21:22</reference> There is no need of instituted means of
   worship, nor of ordinances of divine service; for we shall need neither
   increase of grace nor excitations unto its exercise; -- the constant,
   immediate, uninterrupted enjoyment of God and the Lamb supplieth all.
   And it has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine in it; for the
   glory of God does enlighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. The
   light of the sun is excellent; howbeit it has its seasons; -- after it
   has shone in its brightest lustre, it gives place to the night and
   darkness. So is the light of the moon of great use in the night; but it
   has its seasons also. Such is the light we have of the glory of God and
   the Lamb in this world. Sometimes it is as the light of the sun, which,
   under the Gospel, is sevenfold, as the light of seven days in one in
   comparison of the Law, <reference osisRef="Isa.30.26">Isaiah 30:26</reference>; -- sometimes as the light of the
   moon, which giveth relief in the night of temptations and trials. But
   it is not constant; we are under a vicissitude of light and darkness,
   -- views of Christ, and a loss of him. But in heaven the perpetual
   presence of Christ with his saints makes it always one noon of light
   and glory.
				</p><p>
   4. This vision is not in the least liable unto any weakening from
   internal defects, nor any assaults from temptations, as is the sight of
   faith in this life. No doubts or fears, no disturbing darts or
   injections, shall there have any place. There shall no habit, no
   quality, no inclination or disposition remain in our souls, but what
   shall eternally lead us unto the contemplation of the glory of Christ
   with delight and complacency. Nor will there be any defect in the
   gracious powers of our souls, as unto a perpetual exercise of them; and
   as to all other opposing enemies, we shall be in a perpetual triumph
   over them, <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.55 1Cor.15.56 1Cor.15.57">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</reference> The mouth of iniquity shall be stopped for
   ever, and the voice of the self-avenger shall be heard no more.
				</p><p>
   Wherefore, the vision which we shall have in heaven of the glory of
   Christ is serene, -- always the same, always new and indeficient,
   wherein nothing can disturb the mind in the most perfect operations of
   a blessed life. And when all the faculties of the soul can, without any
   internal weakness or external hindrances, exercise their most perfect
   operations on the most perfect object, -- therein lies all the
   blessedness which our nature is capable of.
				</p><p>
   Wherefore, whenever in this life we attain any comfortable, refreshing
   view of the glory of Christ by the exercise of faith on the revelation
   of it, with a sense of our interest therein, we cannot but long after,
   and desire to come unto, this more perfect, abiding, invariable aspect
   of it.

<title>Chapter 14 Other differences between our beholding the glory of Christ by faith in this world and by sight in heaven</title>
<p>   Among the many other differences which might be insisted on (although
   the greatest of them are unto us at present absolutely
   incomprehensible, and so not to be inquired into), I shall name two
   only, and so put a close to this Discourse.
				</p><p>
   I. In the view which we have here of the glory of Christ by faith, we
   gather things, as it were, one by one, in several parts and parcels,
   out of the Scripture; and comparing them together in our minds, they
   become the object of our present sight, -- which is our spiritual
   comprehension of the things themselves. We have no proposal of the
   glory of Christ unto us by vision or illustrious appearance of his
   person, as Isaiah had of old, chap. vi. 1-4; or as John had in the
   Revelation, chap. i. 13-16. We need it not; -- it would be of no
   advantage unto us. For as unto the assurance of our faith, we have a
   word of prophecy more useful unto us than a voice from heaven, <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.17 2Pet.1.18 2Pet.1.19">2 Peter 1:17-19</reference> And of those who received such visions, though of eminent use
   unto the church, yet as unto themselves, one of them cried out, "Woe is
   me! I am undone;" and the other "fell as dead at his feet." We are not
   able in this life to bear such glorious representations of him, unto
   our edification.
				</p><p>
   And as we have no such external proposals of his glory unto us in
   visions, so neither have we any new revelations of him by immediate
   inspiration. We can see nothing of it, know nothing of it but what is
   proposed unto us in the Scripture, and that as it is proposed. Nor does
   the Scripture itself, in any one place, make an entire proposal of the
   glory of Christ with all that belongs unto it; nor is it capable of so
   doing, nor can there be any such representation of it unto our capacity
   on this side heaven. If all the light of the heavenly luminaries had
   been contracted into one, it would have been destructive, not useful,
   to our sight; but being by divine wisdom distributed into sun, moon,
   and stars, each giving out his own proportion, it is suited to declare
   the glory of God and to enlighten the world. So, if the whole
   revelation of the glory of Christ, and all that belongs unto it, had
   been committed into one series and contexture of words, it would have
   overwhelmed our minds rather than enlightened us. Wherefore God has
   distributed the light of it through the whole firmament of the books of
   the Old and New Testament; whence it communicates itself, by various
   parts and degrees, unto the proper use of the church. In one place we
   have a description of his person, and the glory of it; sometimes in
   words plain and proper, and sometimes in great variety of allegories,
   conveying a heavenly sense of things unto the minds of them that do
   believe; -- in others, of his love and condescension in his office, and
   his glory therein. His humiliation, exaltation, and power, are in like
   manner in sundry places represented unto us. And as one star differeth
   from another in glory, so it was one way whereby God represented the
   glory of Christ in types and shadows under the Old Testament, and
   another wherein it is declared in the New. Illustrious testimonies unto
   all these things are planted up and down in the Scripture, which we may
   collect as choice flowers in the paradise of God, for the object of our
   faith and sight thereby.
				</p><p>
   So the spouse in the Canticles considered every part of the person and
   grace of Christ distinctly by itself, and from them all concludes that
   "he is altogether lovely," chap. v. 10-16. So ought we to do in our
   study of the Scripture, to find out the revelation of the glory of
   Christ which is made therein, as did the prophets of old, as unto what
   they themselves received by immediate inspiration. They "searched
   diligently what the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify,
   when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory
   that should follow," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11">1 Peter 1:11</reference> But this seeing of Christ by parts
   in the revelation of him is one cause why we see him here but in parts.
				</p><p>
   Some suppose that by chopping, and painting, and gilding, they can make
   an image of Christ that shall perfectly represent him to their senses
   and carnal affections from head to foot. But they "feed on ashes" and
   have "a lie in their right hand." Jesus Christ is evidently crucified
   before our eyes in the Scripture, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.1">Galatians 3:1</reference> So also is he evidently
   exalted and glorified therein. And it is the wisdom of faith to gather
   into one those parcelled descriptions that are given of him, that they
   may be the object of its view and contemplation.
				</p><p>
   In the vision which we shall have above, the whole glory of Christ will
   be at once and always represented unto us; and we shall be enabled in
   one act of the light of glory to comprehend it. Here, indeed, we are at
   a loss; -- our minds and understandings fail us in their
   contemplations. It will not yet enter into our hearts to conceive what
   is the beauty, what is the glory of this complete representation of
   Christ unto us. To have at once all the glory of what he is, what he
   was in his outward state and condition, what he did and suffered, what
   he is exalted unto, -- his love and condescension, his mystical union
   with the church, and the communication of himself unto it, with the
   recapitulation of all things in him, -- and the glory of God, even the
   Father, in his wisdom, righteousness, grace, love, goodness, power,
   shining forth eternally in him, in what he is, has done, and does, --
   all presented unto us in one view, all comprehended by us at once, is
   that which at present we cannot conceive. We can long for it, pant
   after it, and have some foretastes of it, -- namely, of that state and
   season wherein our whole souls, in all their powers and faculties,
   shall constantly, inseparably, eternally cleave by love unto whole
   Christ, in the sight of the glory of his person and grace, until they
   are watered, dissolved, and inebriated in the waters of life and the
   rivers of pleasure that are above for evermore. So must we speak of the
   things which we admire, which we adore, which we love, which we long
   for, which we have some foretastes of in sweetness ineffable, which yet
   we cannot comprehend.
				</p><p>
   These are some few of those things whence ariseth the difference
   between that view which we have here of the glory of Christ, and that
   which is reserved for heaven, -- namely, such as are taken from the
   difference between the means or instruments of the one and the other,
   faith and sight.
				</p><p>
   II. In the last place, the great difference between them consists in,
   and is manifested by, their effects. Hereof I shall give some few
   instances, and close this Discourse.
				</p><p>
   First, The vision which we shall have of the glory of Christ in heaven,
   and of the glory of the immense God in him, is perfectly and absolutely
   transforming. It does change us wholly into the image of Christ. When
   we shall see him, we shall be as he is; we shall be like him, because
   we shall see him, <reference osisRef="1John.3.2">1 John 3:2</reference> But although the closing, perfecting
   act of this transformation be an act of sight, or the sight of glory,
   yet there are many things towards it, or degrees in it, which we may
   here take notice of in our way.
				</p><p>
   1. The soul, upon its departure from the body, is immediately freed
   from all the weakness, ability, darkness, uncertainties, and fears,
   which were impressed on it from the flesh, wherewith it was in the
   strictest union. The image of the first Adam as fallen is then
   abolished. Yea, it is not only freed from all irregular, sinful
   distempers cleaving to our nature as corrupted, but from all those
   sinless grievances and infirmities which belong unto the original
   constitution of it. This necessarily ensues on the dissolution of the
   person in order unto a blessed state. The first entrance by mortality
   into immortality, is a step towards glory. The ease which a blessed
   soul finds in a deliverance from this encumbrance, is a door of
   entrance into eternal rest. Such a change is made in that which in
   itself is the centre of all evil, -- namely, death, -- that it is made
   a means of freeing us from all the remainders of what is evil.
				</p><p>
   For this does not follow absolutely on the nature of the thing itself.
   A mere dissolution of our natures can bring no advantage with it,
   especially as it is a part of the curse. But it is from the
   sanctification of it by the death of Christ. Hereby that which was
   God's ordinance for the infliction of judgment, becomes an effectual
   means for the communication of mercy, <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.22 1Cor.15.54">1 Corinthians 15:22, 54</reference> It is by
   virtue of the death of Christ alone, that the souls of believers are
   freed by death from all impressions of sin, infirmity, and evils, which
   they have had from the flesh; which were their burden, under which they
   groaned all their days. No man knows in any measure the excellency of
   this privilege, and the dawnings of glory which are in it, who has not
   been wearied, and even worn out, through long conflicting with the body
   of death. The soul hereon being freed from all annoyances, all
   impressions from the flesh, is expedite and enlarged unto the exercise
   of all its gracious faculties, as we shall see immediately.
				</p><p>
   With wicked men it is not so. Death unto them is a curse; and the curse
   is the means of the conveyance of all evil, and not deliverance from
   any. Wherein they have been warmed and refreshed by the influences of
   the flesh, they shall be deprived of it. But their souls in their
   separate state, are perpetually harassed with all the disquieting
   passions which have been impressed on their minds by their corrupt
   fleshly lusts. In vain do such persons look for relief by death. If
   there be any thing remaining of present good and usefulness to them,
   they shall be deprived of it. And their freedom for a season from
   bodily pains in no way lie in the balance against that confluence of
   evils which death will let in upon them.
				</p><p>
   2. The "spirits of just men," being freed by death from the clog of the
   flesh, not yet refined, -- all the faculties of their souls, and all
   the graces in them, as faith, love, and delight, are immediately set at
   liberty, enabled constantly to exercise themselves on God in Christ.
   The end for which they were created, for which our nature was endowed
   with them, was, that we might adhere unto God by them, and come unto
   the enjoyment of him. Being now freed wholly from all that impotency,
   perverseness, and disability unto this end, with all the effects of
   them, which came upon them by the fall; they are carried with a full
   stream towards God, cleaving unto him with the most intense embraces.
   And all their actings towards God shall be natural, with facility, joy,
   delight, and complacency. We know not yet the excellency of the
   operations of our souls in divine things, when disburdened of their
   present weight of the flesh. And this is a second step towards the
   consummation of glory. For, --
				</p><p>
   In the resurrection of the body, upon its full redemption, it shall be
   so purified, sanctified, glorified, as to give no obstruction unto the
   soul in its operations, but be a blessed organ for its highest and most
   spiritual actings. The body shall never more be a trouble, a burden
   unto the soul, but an assistant in its operations, and participant of
   its blessedness. Our eyes were made to see our Redeemer, and our other
   senses to receive impressions from him, according unto their capacity.
   As the bodies of wicked men shall be restored unto them to increase and
   complete their misery in their sufferings; so shall the bodies of the
   just be restored unto them, to heighten and consummate their
   blessedness.
				</p><p>
   3. These things are preparatory unto glory. The complete communication
   of it is by the infusion of a new heavenly light into the mind,
   enabling us to see the Lord Christ as he is. The soul shall not be
   brought into the immediate presence of Christ without a new power, to
   behold him and the immediate representation of his glory. Faith now
   does cease, as unto the manner of its operation in this life, whilst we
   are absent from Christ. This light of glory succeeds into its room,
   fitted for that state and all the ends of it, as faith is for that
   which is present. And, --
				</p><p>
   4. In the first operation of this light of glory, believers shall so
   behold the glory of Christ, and the glory of God in him, as that there
   with and thereby they shall be immediately and universally changed into
   his likeness. They shall be as he is, when they shall see him as he is.
   There is no growth in glory, as to parts; -- there may be as to
   degrees. Additions may be outwardly made unto what is at first received
   as by the resurrection of the body; but the internal light of glory and
   its transforming efficacy is capable of no degrees, though new
   revelations may be made unto it unto eternity. For the infinite
   fountain of life, and light, and goodness, can never be fathomed, much
   less exhausted. And what God spake on the entrance of sin, by the way
   of contempt and reproach, "Behold, the man is become like one of us,"
   upbraiding him with what he had foolishly designed; -- on the
   accomplishment of the work of his grace, he says in love and infinite
   goodness, "Man is become like one of us," in the perfect restoration of
   our image in him. This is the first effect of the light of glory.
				</p><p>
   Faith also, in beholding the glory of Christ in this life, is
   accompanied with a transforming efficacy, as the apostle expressly
   declares, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> It is the principle from whence, and the
   instrumental cause whereby, all spiritual change is wrought in us in
   this life; but the work of it is imperfect; -- first, because it is
   gradual, and then because it is partial.
				</p><p>
   (1.) As unto the manner of its operation, it is gradual, and does not
   at once transform us into the image of Christ; yes, the degrees of its
   progress therein are unto us for the most part imperceptible. It
   requires much spiritual wisdom and observation to obtain an experience
   of them in our own souls. "The inward man is renewed day by day,"
   whilst we behold these invisible things, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.16 2Cor.4.17 2Cor.4.18">2 Corinthians 4:16-18</reference> But how? --
   even as the outward man decays by age, which is by insensible degrees
   and alterations. Such is the transformation which we have by faith, in
   its present view of the glory of Christ. And according to our
   experience of its efficacy herein, is our evidence of its truth and
   reality in the beholding of him. No man can have the least ground of
   assurance that he has seen Christ and his glory by faith, without some
   effects of it in changing him into his likeness. For as on the touch of
   his garment by the woman in the Gospel, virtue went out from him to
   heal her infirmity; so upon this view of faith, an influence of
   transforming power will proceed from Christ unto the soul.
				</p><p>
   (2.) As unto the event, it is but partial. It does not bring this work
   unto perfection. The change wrought by it is indeed great and glorious;
   or, as the apostle speaks, it is "from glory to glory," in a progress
   of glorious grace: but absolute perfection is reserved for vision. As
   to divine worship, perfection was not by the law. It did many things
   preparatory unto the revelation of the will of God concerning it, but
   it "made nothing perfect:" so absolute perfection in holiness, and the
   restoration of the image of God, is not by the Gospel, is not by faith;
   -- however, it gives us many preparatory degrees unto it, as the
   apostle fully declares, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.10 Phil.3.11 Phil.3.12 Phil.3.13 Phil.3.14">Philippians 3:10-14</reference>
				</p><p>
   Secondly, Vision is beatifical, as it is commonly called, and that not
   amiss. It gives perfect rest and blessedness unto them in whom it is.
   This may be a little opened in the ensuing observations.
				</p><p>
   1. There are continual operations of God in Christ in the souls of them
   that are glorified, and communications from him unto them. For all
   creatures must externally live, even in heaven, in dependence on Him
   who is the eternal fountain of being, life, goodness, and blessedness
   unto all. As we cannot subsist one moment in our beings, lives, souls,
   bodies, the inward or outward man, without the continual acting of
   divine power in us, and towards us; so in the glorified state our all
   shall depend eternally on divine power and goodness, communicating
   themselves unto us, for all the ends of our blessed subsistence in
   heaven.
				</p><p>
   2. What is the way and manner of these communications, we cannot
   comprehend. We cannot, indeed, fully understand the nature and way of
   his spiritual communications unto us in this life. We know these things
   by their signs, their outward means, and principally by the effects
   they produce in the real change of our natures; but in themselves we
   see but little of them. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and we hear
   the sound thereof, but we know not whence it cometh, and whither it
   goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit," <reference osisRef="John.3.8">John 3:8</reference> All
   God's real operations in heaven and earth are incomprehensible, as
   being acts of infinite power; and we cannot search them out unto
   perfection.
				</p><p>
   3. All communications from the Divine Being and infinite fulness in
   heaven unto glorified saints, are in and through Christ Jesus, who
   shall for ever be the medium of communication between God and the
   church, even in glory. All things being gathered into one head in him,
   even things in heaven, and things in earth, -- that head being in
   immediate dependence on God, -- this order shall never be dissolved,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10 Eph.1.11">Ephesians 1:10-11</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.23">1 Corinthians 3:23</reference> And on these communications from God
   through Christ depends entirely our continuance in a state of
   blessedness and glory. We shall no more be self-subsistent in glory
   than we are in nature or grace.
				</p><p>
   4. The way on our part whereby we shall receive these communications
   from God by Christ, which are the eternal springs of life, peace, joy,
   and blessedness, is this vision the sight whereof we speak. For, as it
   is expressly assigned thereunto in the Scripture, so whereas it
   contains the perfect operation of our minds and souls in a perfect
   state, on the most perfect object, it is the only means of our
   blessedness. And this is the true cause whence there neither is nor can
   be any satiety or weariness in heaven, in the eternal contemplation of
   the same glory. For not only the object of our sight is absolutely
   infinite, which can never be searched unto the bottom, yea, is
   perpetually new unto a finite understanding; but our subjective
   blessedness consisting in continual fresh communications from the
   infinite fulness of the divine nature, derived unto us through vision,
   is always new, and always will be so to eternity. Herein shall all the
   saints of God drink of the rivers of pleasure that are at his right
   hand, be satisfied with his likeness, and refresh themselves in the
   eternal springs of life, light, and joy for evermore.
				</p><p>
   This effect, -- that view, which we have by faith of the glory of
   Christ in this world, does not produce. It is sanctifying, not
   glorifying. The best of saints are far from a perfect or glorified
   state in this life; and that not only on the account of the outward
   evils which in their persons they are exposed unto, but also of the
   weakness and imperfection of their inward state in grace. Yet we may
   observe some things unto the honour of faith in them who have received
   it. As --
				</p><p>
   (1.) In its due exercise on Christ, it will give unto the souls of
   believers some previous participation of future glory, working in them
   dispositions unto, and preparation for, the enjoyment of it.
				</p><p>
   (2.) There is no glory, no peace, no joy, no satisfaction in this
   world, to be compared with what we receive by that weak and imperfect
   view which we have of the glory of Christ by faith; yea, all the joys
   of the world are a thing of nought in comparison of what we so receive.
				</p><p>
   (3.) It is sufficient to give us such a perception, such a foretaste of
   future blessedness in the enjoyment of Christ, as may continually stir
   us up to breathe and pant after it. But it is not beatifical.
				</p><p>
   Other differences of an alike nature between our beholding of the glory
   of Christ in this life by faith, and that vision of it which is
   reserved for heaven, might be insisted on; but I shall proceed no
   farther. There is nothing farther for us to do herein but that now and
   always we shut up all our meditations concerning it with the deepest
   self-abasement, out of a sense of our unworthiness and insufficiency to
   comprehend those things, admiration of that excellent glory which we
   cannot comprehend, and vehement longings for that season when we shall
   see him as he is, be ever with him, and know him even as we are known.</p>

   To the Reader.
				</p><p>
   The design of this preface is not to commend either the author or the
   matter contained in this little book. Let every reader do as he finds
   cause. Nor need any assurance be given that Dr Owen was the author, to
   any who have conversed with his writings, and will be at the pains to
   read this over. It is, indeed, his application of the former Discourses
   upon this subject, printed in the year 1684. But the reason why it was
   not then added (the omission whereof rendered that book imperfect to
   judicious readers) seems necessary to be given. Had it pleased God he
   had lived a little longer, it would have come out as perfect as his
   other works. But there being no more transcribed in his lifetime than
   what was then printed, and that published soon after his death, these
   two chapters, wrote only with his own hand, were found too late to be
   then added. They are therefore now printed to complete those
   Discourses. And it is presumed, that as no serious Christian who reads
   this will be satisfied without the other also, so all who prize the
   former will be glad of the opportunity to add this thereunto. [8]
</p>

<title>Chapter 1 Application of the foregoing meditations concerning the glory of Christ first in an exhortation unto such as are not yet partakers of him</title>
<p>   That which remains is, to make some application of the glorious truth
   insisted on unto the souls of them that are concerned; and what I have
   to offer unto that end I shall distribute under two heads. The first
   shall be with respect unto them who are yet strangers from this holy
   and glorious One, -- who are not yet made partakers of him, nor have
   any especial interest in him. And the second shall be directed unto
   believers, as a guide and assistance unto their recovery from spiritual
   decays, and the revival of a spring of vigorous grace, holiness, and
   obedience in them.
				</p><p>
   For the first of these, although it seems not directly to lie in our
   way, yet is it suited unto the method of the Gospel, that wherever
   there is a declaration of the excellencies of Christ, in his person,
   grace, or office, it should be accompanied with an invitation and
   exhortation unto sinners to come unto him. This method he himself first
   made use of, <reference osisRef="Matt.11.27 Matt.11.28 Matt.11.29 Matt.11.30">Matthew 11:27-30</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.7.37 John.7.38">John 7:37-38</reference>, and consecrated it unto
   our use also. Besides, it is necessary from the nature of the things
   themselves; for who can dwell on the consideration of the glory of
   Christ, being called therewith to the declaration of it, but his own
   mind will engage him to invite lost sinners unto a participation of
   him? But I shall at present proceed no farther in this exhortation, but
   only unto the proposal of some of those considerations which may
   prepare, incline, and dispose their minds unto a closure with him as he
   is tendered in the Gospel. As, --
				</p><p>
   1. Let them consider well what is their present state with respect unto
   God and eternity. This Moses wisheth for the Israelites, <reference osisRef="Deut.32.29">Deuteronomy 32:29</reference>, "Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
   consider their latter end!" It is the greatest folly in the world to
   leave the issues of these things unto an uncertain hazard; and that man
   who cannot prevail with himself strictly to examine what is his state
   and condition with respect unto eternity, does never do any good nor
   abstain from any evil in a due manner. Remember, therefore, that "many
   are called, but few are chosen." To be called, is to enjoy all the
   outward privileges of the Gospel, -- which is all you unto whom I speak
   can pretend unto; yet this you may do and not be chosen; -- even among
   those unto whom the word is preached, they are but few that shall be
   saved. In the distribution made by our Lord Jesus Christ of the hearers
   of the word into four sorts of ground, it was but one of them that
   received real benefit thereby; and if our congregations are no better
   than were his hearers, there is not above a fourth part of them that
   will be saved, -- it may be a far less number; -- and is it not strange
   that every one of them is not jealous over himself and his own
   condition? Many herein deceive themselves until they fall under woeful
   surprisals. And this is represented in the account of the final
   judgment; for the generality of those who have professed the Gospel are
   introduced as complaining of their disappointments, <reference osisRef="Matt.25.41 Matt.25.42 Matt.25.43 Matt.25.44">Matthew 25:41-44</reference>
   [10-12?]. For what is there spoken is only a declaration of what befell
   them here in the close of their lives, and their personal judgment
   thereon.
				</p><p>
   2. Take heed of being deluded by common presumptions. Most men have
   some thoughts in general about what their state is, and what it will be
   in the issue; but they make no diligent search into this matter,
   because a number of common presumptions do immediately insinuate
   themselves into their minds for their relief; and they are such as all
   whose force and efficacy unto this end lies in this, that they differ
   from others, and are better than they; -- as that they are Christians,
   that they are in the right way of religion, that they are partakers of
   the outward privileges of the Gospel, hearing the word, and
   participating of the sacraments; -- that they have light and
   convictions, so as that they abstain from sin, and perform duties so as
   others do not; and the like. All those with whom it is not so, who are
   behind them in these things, they judge to be in an ill state and
   condition, whence they entertain good hopes concerning themselves; and
   this is all that most trust unto. It is not my present business to
   discourse the vanity of presumptions; -- it has been done by many. I
   give only this warning in general, unto those who have the least design
   or purpose to come to Christ, and to be made partakers of him, that
   they put no trust in them, that they rely not on them; for if they do
   so they will eternally deceive their souls. This was a great part of
   the preparatory ministry of John the Baptist, <reference osisRef="Matt.3.9">Matthew 3:9</reference>, "Think not
   to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father." This was
   their great comprehensive privilege, containing all the outward church
   and covenant advantages. These they rested in and trusted to unto their
   ruin; herein he designed to undeceive them.
				</p><p>
   3. Consider aright what it is to live and die without an interest in
   Christ, without a participation of him. Where this is not stated in the
   mind, where thoughts of it are not continually prevalent, there can be
   no one step taken in the way towards him. Unless we are thoroughly
   convinced that without him we are in a state of apostasy from God,
   under the curse, obnoxious unto eternal wrath, as some of the worst of
   God's enemies, we shall never flee unto him for refuge in a due manner.
   "The whole have no need of a physician, but the sick." Christ "came not
   to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;" and the conviction
   intended is the principal end of the ministry of the law. The miseries
   of this state have been the subject of innumerable sermons and
   discourses; but there is a general misery in the whole, that few take
   themselves to be concerned therein, or apply these things unto
   themselves. Let us tell men of it a thousand times, yet they either
   take no notice of it, or believe it not, or look on it as that which
   belongs unto the way and course of preaching, wherein they are not
   concerned. These things, it seems, preachers must say; and they may
   believe them who have a mind whereunto. It is a rare thing that any one
   shall as much as say unto himself, Is it so with me? And if we now,
   together with this caution, tell the same men again, that whilst they
   are uninterested in Christ, not ingrafted into him by faith, that they
   run in vain, that all their labour in religion is lost, that their
   duties are all rejected, that they are under the displeasure and curse
   of God, that their end is eternal destruction, -- which are all
   unquestionably certain, -- yet will they let all these things pass by
   without any farther consideration.
				</p><p>
   But here I must fix with them unto whom I speak at present, -- unless
   there be a full conviction in them of the woeful, deplorable condition
   of every soul, of whatever quality, profession, religion, outward state
   it be, who is not yet made partaker of Christ, all that I have farther
   to add will be of no signification. Remember, then, that the due
   consideration hereof is unto you, in your state, your chiefest
   concernment in this world: and be not afraid to take in a full and deep
   sense of it; for if you are really delivered from it, and have good
   evidence thereof, it is nothing unto you but matter of eternal praise
   and thanksgiving. And if you are not so, it is highly necessary that
   your minds should be possessed with due apprehension of it. The work of
   this conviction is the first effect of true religion; and the great
   abuse of religion in the world is, that a pretence of it deludes the
   minds of men to apprehend that it is not necessary: for to be of this
   or that religion, -- of this or that way in religion, -- is supposed
   sufficient to secure the eternal state of men, though they are never
   convinced of their lost estate by nature.
				</p><p>
   4. Hereon consider the infinite condescension and love of Christ, in
   his invitations and calls of you to come unto him for life,
   deliverance, mercy, grace, peace, and eternal salvation. Multitudes of
   these invitations and calls are recorded in the Scripture, and they are
   all of them filled up with those blessed encouragements which divine
   wisdom knows to be suited unto lost, convinced sinners, in their
   present state and condition. It were a blessed contemplation, to dwell
   on the consideration of the infinite condescension, grace, and love of
   Christ, in his invitations to sinners to come unto him that they may be
   saved, -- of that mixture of wisdom and persuasive grace that is in
   them, -- of the force and efficacy of the pleading and argument that
   they are accompanied withal, as they are recorded in the Scripture; but
   that belongs not to my present design. This I shall only say, that in
   the declaration and preaching of them, Jesus Christ yet stands before
   sinners, calling, inviting, encouraging them to come unto him.
				</p><p>
   This is somewhat of the word which he now speaks unto you: Why will ye
   die? why will ye perish? why will you not have compassion on your own
   souls? Can your hearts endure, or can your hands be strong, in the day
   of wrath that is approaching? It is but a little while before all your
   hopes, your reliefs, and presumptions will forsake you, and leave you
   eternally miserable. Look unto me, and be saved; -- come unto me, and I
   will ease you of all sins, sorrows, fears, burdens, and give rest unto
   your souls. Come, I entreat you; -- lay aside all procrastinations, all
   delays; -- put me off no more; -- eternity lies at the door. Cast out
   all cursed, self-deceiving reserves; -- do not so hate me as that you
   will rather perish than accept of deliverance by me.
				</p><p>
   These and the like things does the Lord Christ continually declare,
   proclaim, plead, and urge on the souls of sinners; as it is fully
   declared, <reference osisRef="Prov.1.20 Prov.1.21 Prov.1.22 Prov.1.23 Prov.1.24 Prov.1.25 Prov.1.26 Prov.1.27 Prov.1.28 Prov.1.29 Prov.1.30 Prov.1.31 Prov.1.32 Prov.1.33">Proverbs 1:20-33</reference> He does it in the preaching of the word, as
   if he were present with you, stood amongst you, and spake personally to
   every one of you. And because this would not suit his present state of
   glory, he has appointed the ministers of the gospel to appear before
   you, and to deal with you in his stead, avowing as his own the
   invitations that are given you in his name, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.19 2Cor.5.20">2 Corinthians 5:19-20</reference>
				</p><p>
   Consider therefore, his infinite condescension, grace, and love herein.
   Why all this towards you? Does he stand in need of you? Have you
   deserved it at his hands? Did you love him first? Cannot he be happy
   and blessed without you? Has he any design upon you, that he is so
   earnest in calling you unto him? Alas! it is nothing but the
   overflowing of mercy, compassion, and grace, that moves and acts him
   herein. Here lies the entrance of innumerable souls into a death and
   condemnation far more severe than those contained in the curse of the
   law, <reference osisRef="2Cor.2.15 2Cor.2.16">2 Corinthians 2:15-16</reference> In the contempt of this infinite condescension
   of Christ in his holy invitation of sinners to himself, lies the sting
   and poison of unbelief, which unavoidably gives over the souls of men
   unto eternal ruin. And who shall once pity them to eternity who are
   guilty of it? Yea, but, --
				</p><p>
   5. Perhaps, if you should, on his invitation, begin to look to Him, and
   resolve to come to him, you are greatly afraid that when it comes to
   the trial he will not receive you; for no heart can conceive, no tongue
   can express, what wretched, vile, and provoking sinners you have been.
   That the Lord Christ will receive unto him such as we are, we have no
   hopes, or that ever we shall find acceptance with him. I say it is not
   amiss when persons come so far as to be sensible of what
   discouragements they have to conflict withal, what difficulties lie in
   their way, and what objections do arise against them; for the most do
   perish in a senseless stupidity, -- they will not consider how it is
   with them, what is required of them, nor how it will be in the latter
   end; -- they doubt not but that either they do believe already, or can
   do so when they please. But when any come so far as to charge the
   failure of their acceptance with Christ on their own unworthiness, and
   so are discouraged from coming unto him, there are arguments for their
   conviction and persuasion, which nothing but the devil and unbelief can
   defeat. Wherefore, that which is now proposed unto consideration in
   answer hereunto, is the readiness of Christ to receive every sinner, be
   he who or what he will, that shall come unto him. And hereof we have
   the highest evidences that divine wisdom and grace can give unto us.
   This is the language of the Gospel, of all that the Lord Christ did or
   suffered, which is recorded therein; -- this is the divine testimony of
   the "three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the
   Holy Ghost;" and of the "three that bear witness in earth, the spirit,
   the water, and the blood:" all give their joint testimony, that the
   Lord Christ is ready to receive all sinners that come to him. They who
   receive not this testimony make God a liar, -- both Father, Son, and
   Spirit. Whatever the Lord Christ is in the constitution of his person,
   -- in the representation of the Father, -- in his office, -- in what he
   did on the earth, -- in what he does in heaven, -- proclaims the same
   truth. Nothing but cursed obstinacy in sin and unbelief can suggest a
   thought unto our minds that he is not willing to receive us when we
   come unto him. Herein we are to bear testimony against the unbelief of
   all unto whom the gospel is preached, that come not unto him. Unbelief
   acting itself herein, includes a contempt of the wisdom of God, a
   denial of his truth or faithfulness, an impeachment of the sincerity of
   Christ in his invitations, making him a deceiver, and will issue in an
   express hatred of his person and office, and of the wisdom of God in
   him. Here, then, you are shut up, -- you cannot from hence take any
   countenance unto your unbelief.
				</p><p>
   6. Consider that he is as able to save us as he is ready and willing to
   receive us. The testimonies which he has given us unto his goodness and
   love are uncontrollable; and none dare directly to call in question or
   deny his power. Generally, this is taken for granted by all, that
   Christ is able to save us if he will; yea, who shall question his
   ability to save us, though we live in sin and unbelief? And many expect
   that he will do so, because they believe he can if he will. But indeed
   Christ has no such power, no such ability: he cannot save unbelieving,
   impenitent sinners; for this cannot be done without denying himself,
   acting contrary to his word, and destroying his own glory. Let none
   please themselves with such vain imaginations. Christ is able to save
   all them, and only them, who come to God by him. Whilst you live in sin
   and unbelief, Christ himself cannot save you; but when it comes to the
   trial in particular, some are apt to think, that although they will not
   conclude that Christ cannot save them, yet they do, on various
   accounts, that they cannot be saved by him. This, therefore, we also
   give testimony unto in our exhortation to come unto him, -- namely,
   that his power to save those that shall comply with his call is
   sovereign, uncontrollable, almighty, -- that nothing can stand in the
   way of. All things in heaven and earth are committed unto him; -- all
   power is his; -- and he will use it unto this end, -- namely, the
   assured salvation of all that come unto him.
				</p><p>
   7. Consider greatly what has been spoken of the representation of God,
   and all the holy properties of his nature, in him. Nothing can possibly
   give us more encouragement to come unto him; for we have manifested
   that God, who is infinitely wise and glorious, has designed to exert
   all the holy properties of his nature -- his mercy, love, grace,
   goodness, righteousness, wisdom, and power -- in him, in and unto the
   salvation of them that do believe. Whoever, therefore, comes unto
   Christ by faith on this representation of the glory of God in him, he
   ascribes and gives unto God all that glory and honour which he aimeth
   at from his creatures; and we can do nothing wherewith he is pleased
   equal unto it. Every poor soul that comes by faith unto Christ, gives
   unto God all that glory which it is his design to manifest and be
   exalted in; -- and what can we do more? There is more glory given unto
   God by coming unto Christ in believing, than in keeping the whole law;
   inasmuch as he hath more eminently manifested the holy properties of
   his nature in the way of salvation by Christ, than in giving of the
   law. There is therefore no man who, under gospel invitations, refuseth
   to come unto and close with Christ by believing, but secretly, through
   the power of darkness, blindness, and unbelief, he hates God, dislikes
   all his ways, would not have his glory exalted or manifested, choosing
   rather to die in enmity against him than to give glory to him. Do not
   deceive yourselves; it is not an indifferent thing, whether you will
   come in unto Christ upon his invitations or no, -- a thing that you may
   put off from one season unto another: your present refusal of it is as
   high an act of enmity against God as your nature is capable of.
				</p><p>
   8. Consider that by coming unto Christ you shall have an interest in
   all that glory which we have proposed unto you; for Christ will become
   yours more intimately than your wives and children are yours; and so
   all his glory is yours also. All are apt to be affected with the good
   things of their relations, -- their grace, their riches, their beauty,
   their power; for they judge themselves to have an interest in them, by
   reason of their relation unto them. Christ is nearer to believers than
   any natural relations are to us whatever; they have therefore an
   interest in all his glory. And is this a small thing in your eyes, that
   Christ shall be yours, and all his glory shall be yours, and you shall
   have the advantage of it unto your eternal blessedness? Is it nothing
   unto you to continue strangers from, and uninterested in, all this
   glory? to be left to take your portion in this world, in lusts, and
   sins, and pleasures, and a few perishing trifles, with eternal ruin in
   the close, whilst such durable substance, such riches of glory, are
   tendered unto you?
				</p><p>
   Lastly, consider the horrible ingratitude there is in a neglect or
   refusal to come in to Christ upon his invitation, with the doleful,
   eternal ruin that will ensue thereon. "How shall we escape, if we
   neglect so great salvation?" Impenitent unbelievers under the preaching
   of the gospel, are the vilest and most ungrateful of all God's
   creation. The devils themselves, as wicked as they are, are not guilty
   of this sin; for Christ is never tendered unto them, -- they never had
   an offer of salvation on faith and repentance. This is their peculiar
   sin, and will be the peculiar aggravation of their misery unto
   eternity. "Hear, ye despisers, wonder, and perish." The sin of the
   devil is in malice and opposition unto knowledge, above what the nature
   of man is in this world. Men, therefore, must sin in some instance
   above the devil, or God would not give them their eternal portion with
   the devil and his angels:  this is unbelief.
				</p><p>
   Some, it may be, will say, What then shall we do? what shall we apply
   ourselves unto? what is it that is required of us?
				</p><p>
   1. Take the advice of the apostle, <reference osisRef="Heb.3.7 Heb.3.8 Heb.3.13">Hebrews 3:7-8, 13</reference>, "To-day, if ye
   will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in
   the day of temptation in the wilderness. But exhort one another daily,
   while it is called To-day; lest any of you be hardened through the
   deceitfulness of sin." This day, even this, is unto you in the tender
   of grace the acceptable time; -- this is the day of salvation. Others
   have had this day as well as you, and have missed their opportunity; --
   take heed lest it should be so with you also. Now if any one should
   write it down, or peculiarly commit it to remembrance, "This day there
   was a tender of Christ and salvation in him made unto my soul, -- from
   this time I will resolve to give up myself unto him," and if you form
   your resolutions, charge your consciences with what you have engaged,
   and make yourselves to know that if you go back from it, it is a token
   that you are going to ruin.
				</p><p>
   2. Consider that it is high time for you to make somewhat of religion.
   Do not hang always in suspense; let it not be a question with
   yourselves, whether you have a mind to be saved or no. This is as good
   a time and season for a resolution as ever you are like to have whilst
   in this world. Some things, nay, many things, may fall in between this
   and the next opportunity, that shall put you backward, and make your
   entrance into the kingdom of heaven far more difficult than ever it
   was; and the living in that uncertainty at best, which you do, of what
   will become of you unto eternity, is the most miserable kind of life in
   the world. Those who put far from them the evil day, and live in the
   pursuit of lusts and pleasures, have somewhat that gives them present
   satisfaction, and they say not, "There is no hope," because they "find
   the life of the hand" [<reference osisRef="Isa.57.10">Isaiah 57:10</reference>]; but you have nothing that gives
   you any prevalent refreshment, neither will your latter end be better
   than theirs, if you die without an interest in Christ Jesus. Come,
   therefore, at length, unto a determinate resolution what you will do in
   this matter. Christ has waited long for you, and who knows how soon he
   may withdraw, never to look after you any more?
				</p><p>
   Upon occasion of the preceding Discourse concerning the Glory of
   Christ, I thought it necessary to add unto it this brief exhortation
   unto faith in him, aiming to suit it unto the capacity of the meanest
   sinner that is capable of any self-consideration as unto his eternal
   welfare. But yet, a little farther to give efficacy unto this
   exhortation, it will be necessary to remove some of those common and
   obvious tergiversations that convinced sinners do usually betake
   themselves unto, to put off a present compliance with the calls of
   Christ to come unto him; for although it is unbelief alone, acting in
   the darkness of men's minds and the obstinacy of their wills, that
   effectually keeps off sinners from coming unto Christ upon his call,
   yet it shrouds itself under various pretences, that it may not appear
   in its own ugly form. For no sin whereof men can be guilty in this
   world is of so horrible a nature, and so dreadful an aspect, as is this
   unbelief, where a clear view of it is obtained in evangelical light.
   Wherefore, by the aid of Satan, it suggests other pleas and pretences
   unto the minds of sinners, under which they may countenance themselves
   in a refusal to come to Christ. See <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:4</reference> Any thing else it
   shall be, but not unbelief; -- that they all disavow. I shall therefore
   speak unto a few of those tergiversations in this case which are
   obvious, and which are exemplified in the Gospel itself.
				</p><p>
   First, Some do say, on such exhortations, What is it that you would
   have us to do? -- We hear the word preached, we believe it as well as
   we can, we do many things willingly, and abstain from many evils
   diligently; what is more required of us? This is the language of the
   hearts of the most with whom in this case we have to do. And I say, --
				</p><p>
   1. It is usual with them who do something in the ways of God, but not
   all they should, and so nothing in a due manner, to expostulate about
   requiring of them more than they do. So the people dispute with God
   himself, <reference osisRef="Mal.1.6">Malachi 1:6</reference>, iii. 8, 13. So they in the Gospel who esteemed
   themselves to have done their duty, being pressed unto faith by Christ
   Jesus, ask him with some indignation, "What shall we do, that we might
   work the works of God?" <reference osisRef="John.6.28">John 6:28</reference> If what we do be not enough, what
   is it that you require more of us? So was it with the young man, <reference osisRef="Matt.19.20">Matthew 19:20</reference>, "What lack I yet?" Be advised, therefore, not to be too
   confident of your state, lest you should yet lack that one thing, the
   want whereof might prove your eternal ruin.
				</p><p>
   2. The things mentioned, with all of the like nature, which may be
   multiplied, may be where there is no one spark of saving faith. Simon
   Magus heard the word, and believed as well as he could; -- Herod heard
   it, and did many things gladly; -- and all sorts of hypocrites do upon
   their convictions perform many duties, and abstain from many sins: so
   as that, notwithstanding this plea, you may perish for ever.
				</p><p>
   3. Where these things are sincere, they belong unto the exercise of
   faith; they may be after a sort without faith, but faith cannot be
   without them. But there is a fundamental act of faith, whereby we close
   with Christ, whereby we receive him, that is, in order of nature,
   antecedent unto its acting in all other duties and occasions; -- it is
   laying the foundation; other things belong to the building. This is
   that you are called on to secure; and you may know it by these two
   properties: 
				</p><p>
   1. It is singular. So our Saviour tells the Jews, <reference osisRef="John.6.29">John 6:29</reference>, "This is
   the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent." The act,
   work, or duty of faith, in the receiving of Christ, is a peculiar,
   singular work, wherein the soul yields especial obedience unto God; --
   it is not to be reckoned unto such common duties as those mentioned,
   but the soul must find out wherein it has in a singular manner closed
   with Christ upon the command of God.
				</p><p>
   2. It is accompanied with a universal spiritual change in the whole
   soul, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.17">2 Corinthians 5:17</reference>, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
   things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." Wherefore,
   if you would not choose rather to deceive and ruin your own souls, come
   to the trial whether indeed you have received Christ in such a
   singular, transforming act of faith: do not on such pretences want a
   compliance with the word of exhortation proposed unto you. But, --
				</p><p>
   Secondly, Some will say, they know not how to proceed in this work.
   They can make nothing of it; they have tried to come to this believing,
   but do still fail in what they design; they go on and off, but can make
   no progress, can come to no satisfaction; therefore they think it best
   to let things go in general as they are, without putting themselves to
   farther trouble, as unto any especial act of faith in the receiving of
   Christ. This is the language of men's hearts, though not of their
   mouths, another shelter of unbelief, -- and they act accordingly; they
   have a secret despondency, which keeps them safe from attempting a real
   closure with Christ on the tender of the Gospel. Something may be
   offered unto this distempered frame of mind.
				</p><p>
   1. Remember the disciples that were fishing, and had toiled all night,
   but caught nothing, <reference osisRef="Luke.5.3 Luke.5.4">Luke 5:3-4</reference> Upon the coming of Christ unto them,
   he requires that they should cast out their nets once more; Peter makes
   some excuse, from the labour which they had taken in vain all night;
   however, he would venture once more, on the command of Christ, and had
   an astonishing draught of fishes, verses 5-9. Have you been wearied
   with disappointments in your attempts and resolutions? Yet cast in your
   net this once more, upon the command of Christ, -- venture this once
   more to come unto him on his call and invitation; you know not what
   success he may give unto you.
				</p><p>
   2. Consider that it is not failing in this or that attempt of coming to
   Christ, but a giving over your endeavours, that will be your ruin. The
   woman of Canaan, in her great outcry to Christ for mercy, <reference osisRef="Matt.15.22">Matthew 15:22</reference>,
   had many a repulse. First, it is said, he answered her not a word; then
   his disciples desired that he would send her away, that she might not
   trouble him any more; whereon he gives a reason why he would not regard
   her, or why he could justly pass her by; she was not an Israelitess,
   unto whom he was sent; -- yet she gives not over, but pressing into his
   presence, cries out for mercy, verse 25. Being come to that issue, to
   try and draw out her faith to the utmost, which was his design from the
   beginning, he reckons her among dogs, that were not to have children's
   bread given unto them. Had she now at last given over upon this severe
   rebuke, she had never obtained mercy; but persisting in her request,
   she at last prevailed, verses 27, 28. It may be you have prayed, and
   cried, and resolved, and vowed, but all without success, as you
   suppose; sin has broken through all: however, if you give not over, you
   shall prevail at last; you know not at what time God will come in with
   his grace, and Christ will manifest his love unto you as unto the poor
   woman, after many a rebuke. It may be, after all, he will do it this
   day; and if not, he may do it another: do not despond. Take that word
   of Christ himself for your encouragement, <reference osisRef="Prov.8.34">Proverbs 8:34</reference>, "Blessed is
   the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the
   posts of my doors." If you hear him, and wait, though you have not yet
   admission, but are kept at the gates and posts of the doors, yet in the
   issue you shall be blessed.
				</p><p>
   3. The rule in this case is, <reference osisRef="Hos.6.3">Hosea 6:3</reference>, "Then shall we know, if we
   follow on to know." Are you in the way of knowing Christ in the use of
   means, hearing the word, and sincere endeavours in holy duties? Though
   you cannot yet attain unto any evidence that you have received him,
   have closed with him, nothing can ruin you but giving over the way
   wherein you are; for then shall you know, if you follow on to know the
   Lord. Many can give you their experiences, that if they had been
   discouraged by present overwhelming difficulties, arising from their
   disappointments, breaking of vows, relapses into folly, they had been
   utterly ruined; whereas now they are at rest and peace in the bosom of
   Christ. On a great surprisal, Christ lost at once many disciples, and
   they lost their souls, <reference osisRef="John.6.66">John 6:66</reference>, "They went back, and walked no more
   with him." Take heed of the like discouragements.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly, Some may say, yea, practically they do say, that these things
   indeed are necessary; they must come to Christ by believing, or they
   are undone; but this is not the season of it, -- there will be time
   enough to apply themselves unto it when other occasions are past. At
   present they have not leisure to enter upon and go through with this
   duty; wherefore they will abide in their present state for a while,
   hearing and doing many things, and when time serves, will apply
   themselves unto this duty also.
				</p><p>
   1. This is an uncontrollable evidence of that sottishness and folly
   which is come upon our nature by sin, -- a depravation that the apostle
   places in the head of the evils of corrupted nature, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.1 Titus.3.2 Titus.3.3">Titus 3:1-3</reference> Can
   any thing be more foolish, sottish, and stupid, than for men to put off
   the consideration of the eternal concernment of their souls for one
   hour, being altogether uncertain whether they shall live another or no?
   -- to prefer present trifles before the blessedness or misery of an
   immortal state? For those who never heard of these things, who never
   had any conviction of sin and judgment, to put the evil day far from
   them, is not much to be admired; but for you who have Christ preached
   unto you, who own a necessity of coming unto him, to put it off from
   day to day upon such slight pretences, -- it is an astonishing folly!
   May you not be spoken unto in the language of the Wisdom of God? <reference osisRef="Prov.6.9 Prov.6.10 Prov.6.11">Proverbs 6:9-11</reference> You come to hear the word, and when you go away, the language
   of your hearts is, "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
   folding of the hands to sleep;" we will abide a little while in our
   present state, and afterward we will rouse up ourselves. Under this
   deceit do multitudes perish every day. This is a dark shade, wherein
   cursed unbelief lies hid.
				</p><p>
   2. Consider that this is the greatest engine that Satan makes use of in
   the world among them that hear the word preached unto them, for the
   ruin of their souls. He has other arts, and ways, and methods of
   dealing with other men, -- as by sensual and worldly lusts; but as unto
   them who, through their convictions, do attend unto the preaching of
   the word, this is his great and almost only engine for their ruin:
   There needs no haste in this matter, -- another time will be more
   seasonable, -- you may be sure not to fail of it before you die;
   however, this present day and time is most unfit for it, -- you have
   other things to do, -- you cannot part with your present frame, -- you
   may come again to hear the word the next opportunity. Know assuredly,
   if your minds are influenced unto delays of coming to Christ by such
   insinuations, you are under the power of Satan, and he is like enough
   to hold you fast unto destruction.
				</p><p>
   3. This is as evil and dangerous a posture or frame of mind as you can
   well fall under. If you have learned to put off God, and Christ, and
   the word for the present season, and yet relieve yourselves in this,
   that you do not intend, like others, always to reject them, but will
   have a time to hearken to their calls, you are secured and fortified
   against all convictions and persuasions, all fears; one answer will
   serve for all, -- within a little while you will do all that can be
   required of you. This is that which ruins the souls of multitudes every
   day. It is better dealing with men openly profligate, than with such a
   trifling promiser. See <reference osisRef="Isa.5.7 Isa.5.10">Isaiah 5:7, 10</reference>
				</p><p>
   4. Remember that the Scripture confines you unto the present day,
   without the least intimation that you shall have either another day, or
   another tender of grace and mercy in any day, <reference osisRef="2Cor.6.2">2 Corinthians 6:2</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.3.7 Heb.3.13">Hebrews 3:7, 13</reference>; xii. 15. Take care lest you come short of the grace of God, miss
   of it by missing your opportunity. Redeem the time, or you are lost for
   ever.
				</p><p>
   5. As unto the pretence of your occasions and business, there is a
   ready way to disappoint the craft of Satan in that pretence, -- namely,
   to mix thoughts of Christ and the renovation of your resolutions either
   to come or to cleave unto him with all your occasions. Let nothing put
   it utterly out of your minds; make it familiar unto you, and you will
   beat Satan out of that stronghold, <reference osisRef="Prov.7.4">Proverbs 7:4</reference> However, shake
   yourselves out of this dust, or destruction lies at the door.
				</p><p>
   Fourthly, It is the language of the hearts of some, that if they give
   up themselves unto a compliance with this exhortation, and go seriously
   about this duty, they must relinquish and renounce all their lusts and
   pleasures; yea, much of their converse and society, wherein they find
   so much present satisfaction, as that they know not how to part with
   them. If they might retain their old ways, at least some of them, it
   were another matter; but this total relinquishment of all is very
   severe.
				</p><p>
   Ans. 1. The Jesuits, preaching and painting of Christ among some of the
   Indians, concealed from them his cross and sufferings, telling them
   only of his present glory and power; so as they pretended to win them
   over to faith in him, hiding from them that whereby they might be
   discouraged; and so preached a false Christ unto them, one of their own
   framing. We dare do no such thing for all the world; we can here use no
   condescension, no compliance, no composition with respect unto any sin
   or lust; we have no commission to grant that request of Lot, "Is it not
   a little one? let it be spared;" nor to come to Naaman's terms, "God be
   merciful to me in this thing; in all others I will be obedient."
   Wherefore, --
				</p><p>
   2. We must here be peremptory with you, whatever be the event; if you
   are discouraged by it, we cannot help it. Cursed be the man that shall
   encourage you to come to Christ with hopes of indulgence unto any one
   sin whatever. I speak not this as though you could at once absolutely
   and perfectly leave all sin, in the root and branches of it; but only
   you are to do it in heart and resolution, engaging unto a universal
   mortification of all sin, as by grace from above you shall be enabled;
   but your choice must be absolute, without reserves, as to love,
   interest, and design; -- God or the world, -- Christ or Belial, --
   holiness or sin; there is no medium, no terms of composition, <reference osisRef="2Cor.6.15 2Cor.6.16 2Cor.6.17 2Cor.6.18">2 Corinthians 6:15-18</reference>
				</p><p>
   As unto what you pretend of your pleasures, the truth is, you never yet
   had any real pleasure, nor do know what it is. How easy were it to
   declare the folly, vanity, bitterness, poison of those things which you
   have esteemed your pleasures! Here alone -- namely, in Christ, and a
   participation of him -- are true pleasures and durable riches to be
   obtained; pleasure of the same nature with, and such as, like pleasant
   streams, flow down into the ocean of eternal pleasures above. A few
   moments in these joys are to be preferred above the longest continuance
   in the cursed pleasures of this world. See <reference osisRef="Prov.3.13 Prov.3.14 Prov.3.15 Prov.3.16 Prov.3.17 Prov.3.18">Proverbs 3:13-18</reference>
				</p><p>
   Fifthly, It will be said by some, that they do not see those who
   profess themselves to be believers, to be so much better than they are,
   as that you need to press us so earnestly to so great a change; we know
   not why we should not be accounted believers already, as well as they.
   I shall in a few words, as well as I am able, lay this stumbling-block
   out of the way, though I confess, at this day, it is weighty and
   cumbersome. And I say, --
				</p><p>
   1. Among them that profess themselves to be believers, there are many
   false, corrupt hypocrites; and it is no wonder that on various
   occasions they lay the stumbling-block of their iniquities before the
   faces of others; but they shall bear their own burden and judgment.
				</p><p>
   2. It is acknowledged, it must be bewailed, that some whom we have
   reason to judge to be true believers, yet, through their unfortified
   pride, or covetousness, or carelessness in their conversation, or vain
   attire and conformity to the world, or forwardness, do give just
   occasion of offence. We confess that God is displeased herewith, Christ
   and the Gospel dishonoured, and many that are weak are wounded, and
   others discouraged. But as for you, this is not your rule, -- this is
   not proposed unto you; but that word only is so that will never fail
   you.
				</p><p>
   3. The world does not know, nor is able to make a right judgment of
   believers; nor do you so, for it is the spiritual man alone that
   discerneth the things of God. Their infirmities are visible to all, --
   their graces invisible; the King's daughter is glorious within. And
   when you are able to make a right judgment of them, you will desire no
   greater advancement than to be of their society, <reference osisRef="Ps.16.3">Psalms 16:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   These few instances of the pretences wherewith unbelief covers its
   deformity, and hides that destruction wherewith it is accompanied, may
   suffice unto our present purpose; they are multiplied in the minds of
   men, impregnated by the suggestions of Satan on their darkness and
   folly. A little spiritual wisdom will rend the veil of them all, and
   expose unbelief acting in enmity against Christ under them. But what
   has been spoken may suffice to answer the necessity of the preceding
   exhortation on this occasion.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 2 The way and means of the recovery of spiritual decays and of obtaining fresh springs of grace">
<title>Chapter 2 The way and means of the recovery of spiritual decays and of obtaining fresh springs of grace</title>
<p>   The application of the same truth, in the second place, belongs unto
   believers, especially such as have made any long profession of walking
   in the ways of God and the gospel. And that which I design herein, is
   to manifest, that a steady spiritual view of the glory of Christ by
   faith, will give them a gracious revival from inward decays, and fresh
   springs of grace, even in their latter days. A truth this is, as we
   shall see, confirmed by Scripture, with the joyful experience of
   multitudes of believers, and is of great importance unto all that are
   so.
				</p><p>
   There are two things which those who, after a long profession of the
   gospel, are entering into the confines of eternity do long for and
   desire. The one is, that all their breaches may be repaired, their
   decays recovered, their backslidings healed; for unto these things they
   have been less or more obnoxious in the course of their walking before
   God. The other is, that they may have fresh springs of spiritual life,
   and vigorous actings of all divine graces, in spiritual-mindedness,
   holiness, and fruitfulness, unto the praise of God, the honour of the
   gospel, and the increase of their own peace and joy. These things they
   value more than all the world, and all that is in it; about these
   things are their thoughts and contrivances exercised night and day.
   Those with whom it is otherwise, whatever they pretend, are in the dark
   unto themselves and their own condition; for it is in the nature of
   this grace to grow and increase unto the end. As rivers, the nearer
   they come unto the ocean whither they tend, the more they increase
   their waters, and speed their streams; so will grace flow more freely
   and fully in its near approaches to the ocean of glory. That is not
   saving which does not so.
				</p><p>
   An experience hereof -- I mean of the thriving of grace towards the end
   of our course -- is that alone which can support us under the troubles
   and temptations of life, which we have to conflict withal. So the
   apostle tells us, that this is our great relief in all our distresses
   and afflictions, "for which cause we faint not; but though our outward
   man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day," <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.16">2 Corinthians 4:16</reference>
   If it be so, that in the daily decays of the outward man, in all the
   approaches of its dissolution, we have inward spiritual revivals and
   renovation, we shall not faint in what we undergo. And without such
   continual renovations, we shall faint in our distresses, whatever other
   things we may have, or whatever we pretend unto the contrary.
				</p><p>
   And ordinarily it is so, in the holy, wise providence of God, that
   afflictions and troubles increase with age. It is so, in an especial
   manner, with ministers of the gospel; they have many of them a share in
   the lot of Peter, which our Lord Jesus Christ declared unto him, <reference osisRef="John.21.18">John 21:18</reference>, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst
   whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch
   forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither
   thou wouldest not." Besides those natural distempers and infirmities
   which accompany the decays of life, troubles of life, and in their
   affairs, do usually grow upon them, when they look for nothing less,
   but were ready to say with Job, "We shall die in our nest," <reference osisRef="Job.29.18">Job 29:18</reference> So was it with Jacob, after all his hard labour and travail to
   provide for his family, such things fell out in it in his old age as
   had almost broken his heart. And oft times both persecutions and public
   dangers do befall them at the same season. Whilst the outward man is
   thus perishing, we need great supportment, that we faint not. And this
   is only to be had in an experience of daily spiritual renovations in
   the inner man.
				</p><p>
   The excellency of this mercy the Psalmist expresseth in a heavenly
   manner, <reference osisRef="Ps.92.12 Ps.92.13 Ps.92.14 Ps.92.15">Psalms 92:12-15</reference>, "The righteous shall flourish like the
   palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted
   in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. They
   shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and
   flourishing; to show that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there
   is no unrighteousness in him."
				</p><p>
   The promise in the 12^th verse respects the times of the Messiah, or of
   the New Testament; for so it is prophesied of him, "In his days the
   righteous shall flourish," <reference osisRef="Ps.72.7">Psalms 72:7</reference>, -- namely, through the
   abundance of grace that should be administered from his fulness, as
   <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference> And herein consists the glory of the gospel,
   and not in outward prosperity or external ornaments of divine worship.
   The flourishing of the righteous, I say, in grace and holiness is the
   glory of the office of Christ and of the gospel. Where this is not,
   there is no glory in the profession of our religion. The glory of kings
   is in the wealth and peace of their subjects; and the glory of Christ
   is in the grace and holiness of his subjects.
				</p><p>
   This flourishing is compared to the palm-tree, and the growth of the
   cedar. The palm-tree is of the greatest verdure, beauty, and
   fruitfulness, and the cedar of the greatest and longest growth of any
   trees. So are the righteous compared to the palm-tree for the beauty of
   profession and fruitfulness in obedience; and unto the cedar for a
   continual, constant growth and increase in grace. Thus it is with all
   that are righteous, unless it be from their own sinful neglect, as it
   is with many in this day. They are hereon rather like the shrubs and
   heaths in the wilderness, which see not when good comes, than like the
   palm-tree or the cedars of Lebanon. And hereby do men what lies in them
   to obscure the glory of Christ and his kingdom, as well as disquiet
   their own souls.
				</p><p>
   The words that follow, verse 13, "Those that be planted in the house of
   the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God," are not distinctive
   of some from other, as though some only of the nourishing righteous
   were so planted; but they are descriptive of them all, with an addition
   of the way and means whereby they are caused so to grow and flourish.
   And this is, their implantation in the house of the Lord; -- that is,
   in the church, which is the seat of all the means of spiritual life,
   both as unto growth and flourishing, which God is pleased to grant unto
   believers. To be planted in the house of the Lord, is to be fixed and
   rooted in the grace communicated by the ordinances of divine worship.
   Unless we are planted in the house of the Lord, we cannot flourish in
   his courts. See <reference osisRef="Ps.1.3">Psalms 1:3</reference> Unless we are partakers of the grace
   administered in the ordinances, we cannot flourish in a fruitful
   profession. The outward participation of them is common unto
   hypocrites, that bear some leaves, but neither grow like the cedar nor
   bear fruit like the palm-tree. So the apostle prays for believers, that
   Christ may dwell in their hearts by faith, that they may be "rooted and
   grounded in love," <reference osisRef="Eph.3.17">Ephesians 3:17</reference>, -- "rooted, built up, and
   established," <reference osisRef="Col.2.7">Colossians 2:7</reference> The want hereof is the cause that we have so
   many fruitless professors; they have entered the courts of God by
   profession, but were never planted in his house by faith and love. Let
   us not deceive ourselves herein; -- we may be entered into the church,
   and made partakers of the outward privileges of it, and not be so
   planted in it as to flourish in grace and fruitfulness.
				</p><p>
   That which on this occasion I principally intend, is the grace and
   privilege expressed, verse 14, "They shall still bring forth fruit in
   old age; they shall be fat and flourishing." There be three things
   which constitute a spiritual state, or belong to the life of God. 1.
   That believers be fat; that is, by the heavenly juice, sap, or fatness
   of the true olive, of Christ himself, as <reference osisRef="Rom.11.17">Romans 11:17</reference> This is the
   principle of spiritual life and grace derived from him. When this
   abounds in them, so as to give them strength and vigour in the exercise
   of grace, to keep them from decays and withering, they are said to be
   fat; which, in the Scripture phrase, is strong and healthy. 2. That
   they flourish in the greenness (as the word is) and verdure of
   profession; for vigorous grace will produce a flourishing profession.
   3. That they still bring forth fruit in all duties of holy obedience.
   All these are promised unto them even in old age.
				</p><p>
   Even trees, when they grow old (the palm and the cedar), are apt to
   lose of their juice and verdure: and men in old age are subject unto
   all sorts of decays, both outward and inward. It is a rare thing to see
   a man in old age naturally vigorous, healthy, and strong; and would it
   were not more rare to see any spiritually so at the same season! But
   this is here promised unto believers as an especial grace and
   privilege, beyond what can be represented in the growth or
   fruit-bearing of plants and trees.
				</p><p>
   The grace intended is, that when believers are under all sorts of
   bodily and natural decays, and, it may be, have been overtaken with
   spiritual decays also, there is provision made in the covenant to
   render them fat, flourishing, and fruitful, -- vigorous in the power of
   internal grace, and flourishing in the expression of it in all duties
   of obedience; which is that which we now inquire after.
				</p><p>
   Blessed be God for this good word of his grace, that he has given us
   such encouragement against all the decays and temptations of old age
   which we have to conflict withal!
				</p><p>
   And the Psalmist, in the next words, declares the greatness of this
   privilege: "To show that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there
   is no unrighteousness in him." Consider the oppositions that lie
   against the flourishing of believers in old age, the difficulties of
   it, the temptations that must be conquered, the actings of the mind
   above its natural abilities which are decayed, the weariness that is
   apt to befall us in a long spiritual conflict, the cries of the flesh
   to be spared, and we shall see it to be an evidence of the
   faithfulness, power, and righteousness of God in covenant; -- nothing
   else could produce this mighty effect. So the prophet, treating of the
   same promise, <reference osisRef="Hos.14.4 Hos.14.5 Hos.14.6 Hos.14.7 Hos.14.8">Hosea 14:4-8</reference>, closes his discourse with that blessed
   remark, verse 9, "Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?
   prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right,
   and the just shall walk in them." Spiritual wisdom will make us to see
   that the faithfulness and power of God are exerted in this work of
   preserving believers flourishing and fruitful unto the end.
				</p><p>
   Having laid the foundation of this illustrious testimony, I shall
   farther declare and confirm my intention, so to make way for the
   application of the truth under consideration unto this case, --
   manifesting that the way whereby we may be made partakers of this
   grace, is by a steady view of the glory of Christ, as proposed to us in
   the Gospel.
				</p><p>
   There is a latter spring in the year, a spring in autumn; it is,
   indeed, for the most part, but faint and weak, -- yet is it such as the
   husbandman cannot spare. And it is an evident sign of barren ground,
   when it does not put forth afresh towards the end of the year. God, the
   good husbandman, looks for the same from us, especially if we had a
   summer's drought in spiritual decays; as the Psalmist complains, <reference osisRef="Ps.32.4">Psalms 32:4</reference> Had we not had a latter spring the last year, the land had
   greatly suffered under the drought of the summer. And if we have had
   such a drought in the course of our profession by spiritual decays, as
   God, the good husbandman, looks for a latter spring in us, even in old
   age, in the vigorous acting of grace and fruitful obedience; so without
   it we can neither have peace nor joy in our own souls. If a man,
   therefore, has made a great appearance of religion in his former or
   younger days, and when he is growing into age becomes dead, cold,
   worldly, selfish, -- if he have no fresh springs of spiritual life in
   him, it is an evidence that he has a barren heart, that was never
   really fruitful to God. I know that many stand in need of being excited
   by such warning unto a diligent consideration of their state and
   condition.
				</p><p>
   It is true, that the latter spring does not bring forth the same fruit
   with the former. There is no more required in it but that the ground
   evidence itself to be in good heart, and put forth that which is proper
   unto the season. It may be, such graces as were active and vigorous in
   men at their first conversion unto God, as were carried in a stream of
   warm, natural affections, may not so eminently abound in the latter
   spring of old age; but those which are proper for the season -- as
   namely, spirituality, heavenly-mindedness, weanedness from the world,
   readiness for the cross and death -- are necessary, even in old age, to
   evidence that we have a living principle of grace, and to show thereby
   that God is upright; He is our rock, and there is no unrighteousness in
   him.
				</p><p>
   What is farther to be insisted one shall be reduced unto these four
   heads: 
				</p><p>
   I. That the constitution of spiritual life is such as is meet to
   thrive, grow, and increase unto the end, and will do so, unless it be
   from the default of them in whom it is.
				</p><p>
   II. That notwithstanding this nature and constitution of spiritual
   life, yet believers are subject unto many decays, partly gradual, and
   partly by surprisals in temptation, whereby the growth of it is
   obstructed, unto the dishonour of the gospel and the loss of their own
   peace with joy.
				</p><p>
   III. I shall show that such at present is the condition of many
   professors, -- namely that they are visibly fallen under spiritual
   decays, and do not evidence any interest in the blessed promise
   insisted on.
				</p><p>
   IV. On the confirmation of these things, our inquiry will be, how such
   persons may be delivered from such decays, and by what means they may
   obtain the grace here promised, of spiritual flourishing in old age,
   both in the strengthening of the inward principle of life and abounding
   in fruits of obedience, which are to the praise of God by Jesus Christ;
   and then we shall make application unto this case of that truth which
   is the subject of the preceding discourse.
				</p><p>
   I. The constitution of spiritual life is such as is meet to grow and
   increase unto the end. Hereby it does distinguish itself from that
   faith which is temporary; for there is a temporary faith, which will
   both flourish for a season and bring forth some fruit; but it is not in
   its nature and constitution to abide, to grow and increase, but rather
   to decay and wither. It is described by our Lord Jesus Christ, <reference osisRef="Matt.13.20 Matt.13.21">Matthew 13:20-21</reference> Either some great temptation extinguishes it, or it
   decays insensibly, until the mind wherein it was do manifest itself to
   be utterly barren. And, therefore, whoever is sensible of any spiritual
   decays, he is called unto a severe trial and examination of himself, as
   unto the nature of the principle of his profession and obedience; for
   such decays do rather argue a principle of temporary faith only, unto
   which they are proper and natural, than that whose nature it is to
   thrive and grow to the end, whereon those that have it shall, as it is
   in the promise, still bring forth fruit, and, without their own great
   guilt, be always freed from such decays.
				</p><p>
   That this spiritual life is in its nature and constitution such as will
   abide, thrive, and grow to the end, is three ways testified unto in the
   Scripture.
				</p><p>
   1. In that it is compared unto things of the most infallible increase
   and progress; for besides that its growth is frequently likened unto
   that of plants and trees well watered, and in a fruitful soil, which
   fail not to spring, unless it be from some external violence; it is
   likewise compared unto such things as whose progress is absolutely
   infallible, <reference osisRef="Prov.4.18">Proverbs 4:18</reference>, "The path of the just is, as the shining
   light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day." The path of
   the just is his covenant-walk before God, as it is frequently called in
   the Scripture, <reference osisRef="Ps.119.35 Ps.119.105">Psalms 119:35, 105</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.26.7">Isaiah 26:7</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.23.3">Psalms 23:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.3.3">Matthew 3:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.12.13">Hebrews 12:13</reference>; and it compriseth the principle, profession, and
   fruits of it. This, saith the wise man, is as the shining light; that
   is, the morning light. And wherein is it so? Why, as that goes on by
   degrees, and shineth more and more unto the high noon (though it may be
   interrupted sometimes by clouds and storms); so is this path of the
   just, -- it goes on and increaseth unto the high noon, the perfect day
   of glory. It is in its nature so to do, though it may sometimes meet
   with obstructions, as we shall see afterward; and so does the morning
   light also.
				</p><p>
   There is no visible difference, as unto light, between the light of the
   morning and the light of the evening; yea, this latter sometimes, from
   gleams of the setting sun, seems to be more glorious than the other.
   But herein they differ: the first goes on gradually unto more light,
   until it comes to perfection; the other gradually gives place unto
   darkness, until it comes to be midnight. So is it as unto the light of
   the just and of the hypocrite, and so is it as unto their paths. At
   first setting out they may seem alike and equal; yea, convictions and
   spiritual gifts acted with corrupt ends in some hypocrites, may for a
   time give a greater lustre of profession than the grace of others
   sincerely converted unto God may attain unto. But herein they discover
   their different natures: the one increaseth and goes on constantly,
   though it may be sometimes but faintly; the other decays, grows dim,
   gives place to darkness and crooked walking.
				</p><p>
   This, then, is the nature of the path of the just; and where it is
   otherwise with us in our walk before God, we can have no evidence that
   we are in that path, or that we have a living, growing principle of
   spiritual life in us. And it is fit that professors of all sorts should
   be minded of these things; for we may see not a few of them under
   visible decays, without any sincere endeavours after a recovery, who
   yet please themselves that the root of the matter is in them. It is so,
   if love of the world, conformity unto it, negligence in holy duties,
   and coldness in spiritual love, be an evidence of such decays. But let
   none deceive their own souls; wherever there is a living principle of
   grace, it will be thriving and growing unto the end. And if it fall
   under obstructions, and thereby into decays for a season, it will give
   no rest or quietness unto the soul wherein it is, but will labour
   continually for a recovery. Peace in a spiritually-decaying condition,
   is a soul-ruining security; better be under terror on the account of
   surprisal into some sin, than be in peace under evident decays of
   spiritual life.
				</p><p>
   And, by the way, this comparing of the path of the just unto the
   morning light minds me of what I have seen more than once. That light
   has sometimes cheerfully appeared unto the world, when, after a little
   season, by reason of clouds, tempests, and storms, it has given place
   again to darkness, like that of the night; but it has not so been lost
   and buried like the evening light. After a while it has recovered
   itself unto a greater lustre than before, manifesting that it increased
   in itself whilst it was eclipsed as to us. So has it been with not a
   few at their first conversion unto God: great darkness and trouble
   have, by the efficacy of temptation and injections of Satan, possessed
   their minds; but the grace which they have receded, being as the
   morning light, has after a while disentangled itself, and given
   evidence that it was so far from being extinguished, as that it grew
   and thrived under all those clouds and darkness; for the light of the
   just does in the issue always increase by temptations, as that of the
   hypocrite is constantly impaired by them.
				</p><p>
   Again, as it is as the morning light, than which nothing has a more
   assured progress; so it is called by our Saviour "living water," <reference osisRef="John.4.10">John 4:10</reference>, yea, "a well of water, springing up into everlasting life,"
   verse 14. It is an indeficient spring, -- not a pool or pond, though
   never so large, which may be dried up. Many such pools of light, gifts,
   and profession, have we seen utterly dried up, when they have come into
   age, or been insnared by the temptations of the world. And we may see
   others every day under dangerous decays; their countenances are
   changed, and they have lost that oil which makes the face of a believer
   to shine, -- namely, the oil of love, meekness, self denial, and
   spirituality of converse; and instead thereof, there is spread upon
   them the fulsome ointment of pride, self-love, earthly-mindedness,
   which increaseth on them more and more. But where this principle of
   spiritual life is, it is as the morning light, as an indeficient spring
   that never fails, nor can do so, until it issue in eternal life. And
   sundry other ways there are whereby the same truth is asserted in the
   Scripture.
				</p><p>
   2. There are sundry divine promises given unto believers that so it
   shall be, or to secure them of such supplies of grace as shall cause
   their spiritual life to grow, increase, and flourish unto the end; such
   as that in the psalm which we have considered. For these promises are
   the means whereby this spiritual life is originally communicated unto
   us, and whereby it is preserved in us; by them are we made partakers of
   this divine nature, <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.4">2 Peter 1:4</reference>; and through them is it continued in
   us. Now [as to] promises of this nature, -- namely, that by the
   dispensation of the Spirit of Christ, and supplies of his grace, our
   spiritual life shall flourish, and be made fruitful to the end, -- I
   shall briefly call over one of them only at present, which is recorded,
   <reference osisRef="Isa.44.3 Isa.44.4">Isaiah 44:3-4</reference>, "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and
   floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my
   blessing upon thine offspring: and they shall spring up as among the
   grass, as willows by the water-courses."
				</p><p>
   Although this promise may have respect unto the gracious dealing of God
   with the people of the Jews after their return from the captivity, yet
   has it so only as it was typical of the redemption of the church by
   Jesus Christ; but it belongs properly to the times of the Gospel, when
   the righteous were to flourish, and it is a promise of the new
   covenant, as is manifest in that it is not only given unto believers,
   but is also extended unto their seed and offspring; which is an assured
   signature of new covenant promises. And here is, -- 1. A supposition of
   what we are in ourselves, both before and after our conversion unto
   God, -- namely, as thirsty, dry, and barren ground. We have nothing in
   ourselves, no radical moisture to make us flourishing and fruitful. And
   as it is before, so it is after conversion: "We are not sufficient of
   ourselves; our sufficiency is of God," <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.5">2 Corinthians 3:5</reference> Being left to
   ourselves, we should utterly wither and perish. But, -- 2. Here is the
   blessed relief which God in this case has provided; he will pour the
   sanctifying water of his Spirit and the blessing of his grace upon us.
   And this he will so do as to cause us to spring up as among the grass,
   as willows by the water-courses. There is nothing of a more eminent and
   almost visible growth than willows by the water-courses. Such shall be
   the spiritual growth of believers under the influences of these
   promises; that is, they shall be fat and flourishing, and still bring
   forth fruit. And other promises of the same nature there are many; but
   we must observe three things concerning them, that we may be satisfied
   in their accomplishment. As, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) The promises of the new covenant, as unto the first communication
   of grace unto the elect, are absolute and unconditional; they are the
   executive conveyances of God's immutable purposes and decrees. And what
   should be the condition of the communication of the first grace unto
   us? Nothing that is not grace can be so. If it be said that this also
   is of God in us, which is the condition of the communication of the
   first saving grace unto us, then I would know whether that be bestowed
   upon us without any condition. If it be, then that is the first grace,
   as being absolutely free; if it be not, then what is the condition
   whereon it is bestowed? concerning which the same inquiry must be made,
   -- and so for ever. But this is the glory of covenant promises, that,
   as unto the communication of the grace of conversion and sanctification
   unto the elect, they are absolutely free and unconditionate. But, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) The promises which respect the growth, degrees, and measures of
   this grace in believers are not so. There are many duties required of
   us, that these promises may be accomplished towards us and in us; yea,
   watchful diligence in universal gospel obedience is expected from us
   unto this end. See <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.4 2Pet.1.5 2Pet.1.6 2Pet.1.7 2Pet.1.8 2Pet.1.9 2Pet.1.10">2 Peter 1:4-10</reference> This is the ordinary method of the
   communication of all supplies of grace to make us spiritually flourish
   and be fruitful, -- namely, that we be found in the diligent exercise
   of what we have received. God does sometimes deal otherwise, in a way
   of sovereignty, and surpriseth men with healing grace in the midst of
   their decays and backslidings; as <reference osisRef="Isa.57.17 Isa.57.18">Isaiah 57:17-18</reference> So has many a poor
   soul been delivered from going down into the pit. The good shepherd
   will go out of his way to save a wandering sheep; but this is the
   ordinary method.
				</p><p>
   (3.) Notwithstanding these blessed promises of growth, flourishing, and
   fruitfulness, if we are negligent in the due improvement of the grace
   which we have received, and the discharge of the duties required of us,
   we may fall into decays, and be kept in a low, unthrifty state all our
   days. And this is the principal ground of the discrepancy between the
   glory and beauty of the church, as represented in the promises of the
   Gospel, and as exemplified in the lives and walking of professors, --
   they do not live up unto the condition of their accomplishment in them;
   howbeit, in God's way and time they shall be all fulfilled. We have,
   therefore, innumerable blessed promises concerning the thriving,
   growing, and flourishing of the principle of spiritual life in us, even
   in old age and until death; but the grace promised unto this end will
   not befall us whilst we are asleep in spiritual sloth and security.
   Fervent prayer, the exercise of all grace received, with watchfulness
   unto all holy duties, are required hereunto.
				</p><p>
   3. God has secured the growth of this spiritual life, by the provision
   of food for it, whereby it may be strengthened and increased; for life
   must be preserved by food. And this in our case is the Word of God,
   with all other ordinances of divine worship which depend thereon, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.2 1Pet.2.3">1 Peter 2:2-3</reference> Whatever the state of this life be, -- whether in its
   beginning, its progress, its decays, -- there is suitable nourishment
   provided for it in the good Word of God's grace. If men will neglect
   their daily food that is provided for them, it is no wonder if they be
   weak and thriftless. And if believers are not earnest in their desires
   after this food, -- if they are not diligent in providing of it,
   attending unto it, -- much more if, through corruptions and
   temptations, they count it, in the preaching of it, light and common
   food, which they do not value, -- it is no wonder if they fall into
   spiritual decays; but God has herein provided for our growth even unto
   old age.
				</p><p>
   And this is the first thing which was proposed unto confirmation, --
   namely, that the constitution and nature of spiritual life is such as
   to be indeficient, so as to thrive and grow even in old age, and unto
   the end.
				</p><p>
   II. The second thing proposed is, that notwithstanding all this
   provision for the growth of spiritual life in us, believers, especially
   in a long course of profession, are subject to decays, such as may cast
   them into great perplexities, and endanger their eternal ruin.
				</p><p>
   And these spiritual decays are of two sorts. 1. Such as are gradual and
   universal, in the loss of the vigour and life of grace, both in its
   principle and in its excellence. 2. Such as are occasioned by surprisal
   into sin through the power of temptation; I mean such sins as do waste
   the spiritual powers of the soul, and deprive it of all solid peace.
				</p><p>
   As for temporary believers, give them but time enough in this world,
   especially if it be accompanied with outward prosperity or persecution;
   and, for the most part, their decays of one sort or another will make a
   discovery of their hypocrisy. Though they retain a form of godliness,
   they deny the power of it, <reference osisRef="Prov.1.31">Proverbs 1:31</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Tim.3.5">2 Timothy 3:5</reference> And if they do
   not openly relinquish all duties of religion, yet they will grow so
   lifeless and savourless in them, as shall evidence their condition; for
   so it is with them who are lukewarm, who are neither hot nor cold, who
   have a name to live, but are dead.
				</p><p>
   And herein lieth a signal difference in this matter between sincere
   believers and those who believe only for a time; for those of the
   latter sort do either not perceive their sickness and decays, -- their
   minds being taken up and possessed with other things, -- or if they do
   find that it is not with them as it has been formerly, they are not
   much concerned, and on any occasional new conviction they cry, "Yet a
   little more slumber, a little more sleep, a little more folding of the
   hands to sleep;" but when the other do find any thing of this nature,
   it makes them restless for a recovery. And although, through the many
   snares, temptations, and deceits of sin, or through their ignorance of
   the right way for their healing, they do not many of them obtain a
   speedy recovery, yet none of them do approve themselves in such a
   condition, or turn unto any undue reliefs.
				</p><p>
   Now, that believers are subject to decays in both the ways mentioned,
   we have full testimony in Scripture; for as unto that general, gradual
   decay, in the loss of our first faith, love, and works, in the
   weakening of the internal principle of spiritual life, with the loss
   thereon of delight, joy, and consolation, and the abatement of the
   fruits of obedience, our Lord Jesus Christ does expressly charge it on
   five of the seven churches of Asia, Rev. ii., iii. And in some of them,
   as Sardis and Laodicea, those decays had proceeded unto such a degree,
   as that they were in danger of utter rejection. And hereunto answers
   the experience of all churches and all believers in the world. Those
   who are otherwise minded are dead in sin, and have got pretences to
   countenance themselves in their miserable condition. So is it with the
   Church of Rome; and I wish others did not in some measure follow them
   therein.
				</p><p>
   And as unto those of the second sort, whereinto men are cast by
   surprisals and temptations, producing great spiritual distress and
   anguish of soul, under a sense of God's displeasure, we have an
   instance in David, as he gives us an account of himself, <reference osisRef="Ps.38.1 Ps.38.2 Ps.38.3 Ps.38.4 Ps.38.5 Ps.38.6 Ps.38.7 Ps.38.8 Ps.38.9 Ps.38.10">Psalms 38:1-10</reference>, "O Lord, thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
   sore. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither
   is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. For mine iniquities
   are gone over mine head; as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
   My wounds stink, and are corrupt, because of my foolishness," etc..
				</p><p>
   It is certain that here is a description of a very woeful state and
   condition; and the Psalmist, knowing that he was called of God to be a
   teacher and instructor of the church in all ages, records his own
   experience unto that end. Hence the title of it is, "A Psalm to bring
   to remembrance." Some judge that David had respect unto some great and
   sore disease that he was then visited withal. But if it were so, it was
   only an occasion of his complaint; the cause of it was sin alone. And
   four things he does represent. 1. That he had departed from God, and
   fallen into provoking sins, which had produced great distresses in his
   mind, verses 3, 4. 2. That he had foolishly continued in that state,
   not making timely application to grace and mercy for healing, whereby
   it was grown deplorable, verse 5. And this folly is that alone which
   makes such a condition dangerous, -- namely, when men, on their
   surprisals in sin, do not speedily apply themselves unto healing
   remedies. 3. That he had herein a continual sense of the displeasure of
   God by reason of sin, verses 2-4. 4. That he was altogether restless in
   this state, mourning, groaning, labouring continually for deliverance.
				</p><p>
   This is a clearer delineation of the condition of believers, when,
   either by the greatness of any sin, or by a long continuance in an evil
   and a careless frame, they are cast under a sense of divine
   displeasure. This opens their minds and their hearts, declaring how all
   things are within, which they cannot deny. It is not so with many, in
   the same measures and degrees, as it was with David, whose falls were
   very great; but the substance of it is found in them all. And herein
   the heart knoweth its own bitterness; a stranger intermeddleth not with
   it: none knows the groaning and labouring of a soul convinced of such
   spiritual decays, but he alone in whom they are. Hereon is it cast down
   to the earth, going mourning all the day long, though others know
   nothing of its sorrows: but it is of a far more sad consideration, to
   see men manifesting their inward decays by their outward fruits, and
   yet are little or not at all concerned therein. The former are in ways
   of recovery; these in the paths that go down to the chambers of death.
				</p><p>
   I suppose, therefore, I may take it for granted, that there are few
   professors of religion, who have had any long continuance in the ways
   of it, having withal been exposed unto the temptations of life, and
   much exercised with the occasions of it, but that they have been asleep
   in their days, as the spouse complains of herself, <reference osisRef="Song.5.2">Song of Solomon 5:2</reference>; that is,
   they have been overtaken with decays of one sort or another, either
   with respect unto spiritual or moral duties, -- in their relation unto
   churches or families, in their judgments or their affections, in their
   inward frames or outward actions, they have been overtaken with the
   effects of sloth, negligence, or the want of a continual watch in the
   life of faith. I wish it were otherwise.
				</p><p>
   I principally herein intend those gradual declensions in the life and
   power of grace which men in a long course of profession are subject
   unto. And these for the most part proceed from formality in holy
   duties, under the constant outward performance of them; vehement
   engagements in the affairs of life, an overvaluation of sinful
   enjoyments, growth in carnal wisdom, neglect of daily mortification of
   such sins as men are naturally disposed unto, with a secret influence
   from the prevalent temptation of the days wherein we live; -- which
   things are not now to be spoken unto.
				</p><p>
   III. But I come to that which was proposed in the third place, --
   namely, to show that this at present is the state of many professors of
   religion, that they are fallen under those spiritual decays, and do not
   enjoy the effects of the promises concerning flourishing and
   fruitfulness, which we have insisted on. To fasten a conviction on
   them, or some of them at least, that it is indeed so with them, is my
   present design; and this ought to be done with some diligence. The
   glory of Christ, the honour of the Gospel, and the danger of the souls
   of men do call for it. This is the secret root of all our evil, which
   will not be removed unless it be digged up. Who sees not, who complains
   not of the loss of, or decays in, the power of religion in the days
   wherein we live? But few there are who either know or apply themselves,
   or direct others, unto the proper remedy of this evil. Besides, it is
   almost as difficult to convince men of their spiritual decays as it is
   to recover them from them; but without this, healing is impossible. If
   men know not their sickness, they will not seek for a cure. Some, when
   they see their sickness and their wound, will apply themselves unto
   wrong, useless remedies, like them in the prophet <reference osisRef="Hos">Hosea</reference> None
   will make use of any cure who see no disease at all. Wherefore, to
   fasten a conviction hereof on the minds of some, we may make use of the
   ensuing inquiries and observations.
				</p><p>
   1. Have you, in the way of your profession, had any experience of these
   spiritual decays? I doubt not but that there are some who have been
   preserved green and flourishing from their first conversion unto God,
   who never fell under the power of sloth, neglect, or temptation, at
   least not for any remarkable season; but they are but few. It was not
   so with scarce any of those believers under the Old Testament whose
   lives and walkings are recorded for our instruction; and they must be
   such as lived in an exact and diligent course of mortification. And
   some there are who have obtained relief and deliverance from under
   their decays, -- whose backslidings have been healed, and their
   diseases cured. So it was with David, as he divinely expresseth it, <reference osisRef="Ps.103.1 Ps.103.3 Ps.103.4 Ps.103.5">Psalms 103:1, 3-5</reference>, "Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me,
   bless his holy name. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth
   all thy diseases: who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth
   thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies: who satisfieth thy mouth
   with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's." So
   does he celebrate his deliverance from that state whereof he complains,
   Ps. xxxviii., -- which we mentioned before. And there is no grace or
   mercy that does more affect the hearts of believers, that gives them a
   greater transport of joy and thankfulness, than this of deliverance
   from backslidings. It is a bringing of the soul out of prison, which
   enlargeth it unto praise, <reference osisRef="Ps.142.7">Psalms 142:7</reference> Of this sort I doubt not but
   that there are many; for God has given great warnings of the danger of
   a spiritually-decaying state; and he has made great promises of
   recovery from it; and multitudes in the church are daily exercised
   herein. But I speak in general unto all. Have you any experience of
   such spiritual decays, either in the frame of your spirits or in the
   manner of your walking before God; or, at least, that you are prone
   unto them, if not mightily preserved by the power of grace in your own
   utmost diligence? If you have not so, then I fear it is from one of
   these two causes: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) That, indeed, you have never had any flourishing spiritual state
   in your souls. He that has been always weak and sickly does not know
   what it is to want a state of health and strength, because he never had
   experience of it; much less does he that is dead know what it is to
   want life. But he that from an exquisite temper of health falls into
   languishing distemper, knows distinctly both how it was and how it is
   with him. And the frame of the minds of many professors of religion,
   with the manner of their walking, is such, as that, if they are not
   sensible of spiritual decays, it is evident that they never had any
   good spiritual health; and it is to no purpose to treat with such
   persons about a recovery. There are, amongst those who make an outward
   profession of true religion, many that live in all sorts of sins. If
   you should deal with them about backslidings, decays, and a recovery,
   you will seem unto them as Lot did to his sons-in-law, when he told
   them of the destruction of Sodom, -- as one that mocked, or made sport
   with them, <reference osisRef="Gen.19.14">Genesis 19:14</reference>; or you will be mocked by them for your pains.
   They have been always such as they are; it was never otherwise with
   them; and it is a ridiculous thing to speak to them of a recovery. We
   must be able in this case to say to men, "Remember whence you are
   fallen, and repent, and do the first works," <reference osisRef="Rev.2.5">Revelation of John 2:5</reference> They must have
   had an experience of a better state, or they will not endeavour a
   recovery from that wherein they are. Such, therefore, as see neither
   evil nor danger in their present condition, but suppose all is well
   enough with them, because it is as good as ever it was, will not easily
   be brought under this conviction; but they have that which is of no
   less importance for them to inquire into, -- namely, whether they have
   had any thing of the truth of grace or no. Or, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) If you have not this experience, it is to be feared that you are
   asleep in security, -- which is hardly distinguishable from death in
   sin. The church of Laodicea was sensibly decayed, and gone off from its
   primitive faith and obedience; yet she was so secure, in her condition,
   knew so little of it, that she judged herself, on the contrary, to be
   in a thriving, flourishing state. She thought herself increased in all
   church riches and goods, -- that is, gifts and grace, -- while "she was
   wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked," <reference osisRef="Rev.3.17">Revelation of John 3:17</reference>;
   in such a state as wherein it is questionable whether she had any thing
   of the life and power of grace to be found in her or no. And so is it
   with many churches at this day, especially that which boasts itself to
   be without error or blame. And it is strange that a church should
   suppose that it flourisheth in grace and gifts, when it has nothing but
   a noise of words in their stead.
				</p><p>
   So God testified concerning Ephraim, that "grey hairs were sprinkled on
   him, yet he knew it not," <reference osisRef="Hos.7.9">Hosea 7:9</reference> He was in a declining, dying
   condition, but did not understand it. Hence it is added, "They do not
   return to the Lord their God, nor seek him for all this," verse 10. If
   men will not learn and own their spiritual decays, there is no hope of
   prevailing with them to return unto the Lord. "The whole have no need
   of a physician, but the sick;" Christ "came not to call the righteous,
   but sinners to repentance." Such persons are under the power of a
   stupid security, from whence it will be very hard to rouse them up.
   Hence it is that we have so little success for the most part in calling
   persons to look after a revival and recovery of their decays; they
   acknowledge no such thing in themselves, -- such calls may belong unto
   others; yea, if any word seem to come near them unto their
   disquietment, they are apt to think it was spoken out of spite and
   ill-will towards them: they approve of themselves in their present
   condition. Hence is the complaint of Christ in the ministry of the
   Word, "I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my
   hand, and no man regarded. Ye have set at nought all my counsel, and
   would none of my reproof," <reference osisRef="Prov.1.24 Prov.1.25">Proverbs 1:24-25</reference> Hence, let this truth be
   pressed a thousand times, it is not one of a thousand who will think
   himself so concerned as to apply himself unto a relief. A spirit of
   slumber seems to be poured on many.
				</p><p>
   2. To improve this conviction, I would ask of some, whether they have
   been able to maintain spiritual peace and joy in their souls. I take it
   for granted that ordinarily they are inseparable adjuncts of the life
   of faith, in an humble, fruitful walk before God. The Scripture
   testifieth that they are so; and no experience lies against it in
   ordinary cases. And I suppose that those unto whom I speak do in some
   measure know what they are, and do not delude themselves with fancies
   and imaginations: they have substance in them, however by some derided,
   and to some unknown. Have this peace and joy been maintained and borne
   away in your minds? Have they under all trials and surprisals been
   quickly composed by them? or are you not rather on all occasions uneasy
   and perplexed? This is certain, that a decaying spiritual state and
   solid spiritual peace are inconsistent; and if ever you had such peace,
   you may by the loss of it know into what state you are come.
				</p><p>
   3. Not to inquire farther into things internal and hidden, wherein men
   may justify themselves if they please, there are too many open, visible
   evidences of these decays among professors of religion; they have not
   kept them from the eyes of the church, nor yet from the world. Do not
   pride, selfishness, worldliness, levity of attire, and vanity of life,
   with corrupt, unsavoury communication, abound among many? The world was
   never in a worse posture for conformity than it is at this day, wherein
   all flesh has corrupted its way; and yet, as to things of outward
   appearance, how little distinction is left between it and those who
   would be esteemed more strict professors of religion! Was this the way
   and manner of the saints of old, -- of those that went before us in the
   same profession? Was it so with ourselves in the time of our first
   espousals, when we went after God in the wilderness, in a land that was
   not sown? as <reference osisRef="Jer.2.2">Jeremiah 2:2</reference> Some understand what I say: if we have not,
   some of us, had better days, we never had good days in our lives; if we
   have had them, why do we not stir up ourselves to look after a
   recovery?
				</p><p>
   4. May not God say of many of us what he said of his people of old,
   "Thou hast been weary of me, O Israel?" <reference osisRef="Isa.43.22">Isaiah 43:22</reference> Have we not
   been weary of God, until we have abundant cause to be weary of
   ourselves? The most, I presume, will be ready, with them in Malachi, to
   say, "How or wherein have we been weary of God?" Do we not abide, yea,
   abound, in the duties of his service? What can be more required of us?
   Wherein are we to blame? This were something indeed, but that it is
   often so, that men are weary of God when they even weary God with their
   duties and services, <reference osisRef="Isa.1.13 Isa.1.14">Isaiah 1:13-14</reference> God says in his Word, he is weary:
   they say in their hearts, they are weary, <reference osisRef="Mal.1.13">Malachi 1:13</reference> But I answer, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) Many cannot with any modesty make use of this pretence. Their
   sloth, indifference, and negligence in the observance of the duties of
   divine worship, both in private and public, is notorious. In
   particular, is not the duty of family prayer neglected by many, at
   least as to its constancy and fervency? And although it be grounded in
   the light of nature, confirmed by the general rules of the Scripture,
   requisite unto the dedication of a family unto God, strengthened by the
   constant example of all the saints of old, and necessary in the
   experience of all that walk with God; yet do not many begin to seek out
   pleas and arguing to justify their omission hereof? Are not all things
   filled with the fruits of the negligence of such professors in the
   instruction of their children and servants? And has not God given
   severe rebukes unto many of us, in their fearful miscarriages? And as
   unto the public worship of God, I wish that sloth and indifference did
   not appear upon too many, under various pretences. But, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) This is not that which I do intend. Men may be weary of God,
   whilst they abide in the observance of a multitude of outward duties.
				</p><p>
   [1.] They may be so, with respect unto that spirituality and intention
   of mind unto the exercise of all grace, which are required unto such
   duties. These are the life, the soul, the animating principle of them,
   without which their outward performance is but a dead carcase. Men may
   draw nigh to God with their lips, when their hearts are far from him.
   This is that which becomes God in his worship, and is useful to our own
   souls; for "God is a Spirit, and he will be worshipped in spirit and in
   truth;" which he is not, but in the exercise of the graces of his
   Spirit in the worshippers; "for bodily exercise profiteth little, but
   godliness is profitable unto all things," <reference osisRef="1Tim.4.8">1 Timothy 4:8</reference>
				</p><p>
   To keep up the mind unto this frame, to stir up all grace unto a
   constant vigorous exercise in all holy duties, is a matter whereunto
   great spiritual diligence and watchfulness is required. Watch unto
   prayer. A thousand pretences rise against it; all the arts of sloth,
   formality, weariness of the flesh, and the business of life, do contend
   to frustrate the design of it. And the suitableness of resting in the
   work done, unto the principles of a natural conscience, gives efficacy
   to them all: and when men come to satisfy themselves herein, it may be
   it were better that for a time such duties were wholly omitted; for in
   that case conscience itself will urgently call on men, not hardened in
   sin, to a consideration of their condition: wherefore much spiritual
   labour and diligence is required in this matter. The outward
   performance of religious duties, be they never so many, or however
   strictly enjoined, as the daily and nightly canonical hours amongst the
   Popish devotionists, is an easy task, -- much inferior unto the
   constant labour which some men use in their trades and callings. And in
   them, in the performance of them, either public or in their families,
   men may be weary of God: and according as they are remiss in the
   constant keeping up of spirituality, and the exercise of grace in
   sacred duties, so is the degree of their weariness. And there is almost
   nothing whereby men may take a safer measure of their decays or growth,
   than by the usual frame of their minds in these duties. If they do
   constantly in them stir up themselves to take hold of God, <reference osisRef="Isa.64.7">Isaiah 64:7</reference>, it is an evidence of a good temper of spiritual health in the soul.
   But this will not be done without the utmost watchfulness and care
   against impressions from the flesh and other temptations. But sloth and
   formality herein is a sign of a thriftless state in the inner man: and
   all inventions of such formality are disserviceable unto the interest
   of grace.
				</p><p>
   [2.] So is it with them also, who, attending unto the outward duties of
   religion, do yet indulge themselves in any known sin; for there is
   nothing of God in those duties which tend not unto the mortification of
   all sin: and men may keep up a form of godliness, to countenance
   themselves in the neglect of its power. And in particular, where any
   known sin is indulged unto, where the mortification of it is not duly
   endeavoured, where our religious duties are not used, applied, and
   directed unto that end, there is a weariness of whatever is of God in
   them; nor has the soul any real intercourse or communion with God by
   them.
				</p><p>
   5. If we should make a particular inquiry into the state of our souls
   with respect unto those graces which are most useful, and tend most to
   the glory of God, it is to be feared that the decays of many would be
   made very evident; such are zeal, humility, contriteness of heart,
   spiritual-mindedness, vigour of soul, and delight in the ways of God,
   love, charity, self-denial, and the like. Are we fat and flourishing in
   these things, even in old age? Are they in us, and do they abound? as
   the apostle speaks, <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.8">2 Peter 1:8</reference> Do we bring forth the fruit of them,
   so as to show the faithfulness of God in his supply of grace? I shall
   not make a particular inquiry into them, but only give two general
   rules, whereby we may try ourselves with respect unto them all.
				</p><p>
   (1.) The loss of a spiritual appetite unto the food of our souls is an
   evidence of a decay in all these graces. Spiritual appetite consists in
   earnest desires, and a savoury relish; so it is described by the
   apostle, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.2 1Pet.2.3">1 Peter 2:2-3</reference>, "As new-born babes, desire the sincere milk
   of the Word, that ye may grow thereby; if so be ye have tasted that the
   Lord is gracious." There is required unto this spiritual appetite an
   earnest desire of the Word, grounded on an experience of the grace of
   God in it, unto this end, that we may grow and thrive spiritually
   thereby. And this appetite will give us as just a measure of the state
   of grace in us as a natural appetite unto wholesome food, with due
   digestion thereon, does give of a good state of health in the body.
				</p><p>
   This, therefore, we are to inquire into. Does it abide in us as
   formerly? We hear the Word preached as much as ever; but do we do it
   with the same desire and spiritual relish as before? Some hear to
   satisfy their convictions, some to please their fancies, and some to
   judge of the persons by whom it is dispensed. It is but in few that the
   necessary preparation for the due receiving of it is found.
				</p><p>
   When men grow in age, they lose much of their natural appetite unto
   food. They must eat still for the maintenance of life; but they do it
   not with that desire after it, and that gust in it, as in the days of
   youth and health. Hence they are apt to think that the meat which they
   had formerly was more savoury than what is now provided for them;
   though what they now enjoy is much to be preferred before what they
   then had. The change is in themselves. So we may find not a few
   professors, who are ready to think and say that the preaching which
   they had in former days, and the religious exercises which they were
   engaged in, were far to be preferred above what they now enjoy. But the
   change is in themselves; they have lost their spiritual appetite, or
   their hunger and thirst after the food of their souls.
				</p><p>
   "The full soul loatheth an honey-comb; but to the hungry soul every
   bitter thing is sweet," <reference osisRef="Prov.27.7">Proverbs 27:7</reference> Men being grown full of
   themselves, and of a good conceit of their own abilities, have lost
   their spiritual appetite unto the Word of God; and this makes the Word
   lose its power and efficacy towards them. That Word, which the Psalmist
   says is "sweeter than honey, or the honey-comb," <reference osisRef="Ps.19.10">Psalms 19:10</reference>, has
   little or no taste or relish in it unto them. If they were hungry, they
   would find a sweetness in the bitterest of its reproofs, beyond what
   they can now find in the sweetest of its promises. They come to hear
   the Word with sick desires, and low expectations, as if they were
   invited to eat after a feast, being self-full before. But this loss of
   a spiritual appetite is an evidence of the decay of all other graces
   whatever.
				</p><p>
   (2.) A neglect of making religion our principal business, is another
   evidence of the decay of all sorts of grace in us. For where grace is
   in its proper exercise, it will subordinate all things unto religion,
   and the ends of it, as David twenty times declares in the 119^th Psalm.
   All things, all occasions of life, shall be postponed thereunto. The
   love and valuation of it will bear sway in our minds, our thoughts, and
   affections; and the practice of it shall give rule unto all other
   concernments. But is it so with many amongst us. It is well if religion
   be one thing, -- it is far enough from being the one thing; every other
   thing is preferred before it, and it can hardly crowd in to possess any
   place in their minds. To see men continually plodding in the affairs of
   the world, regulating all their actings by their concernment in them,
   diverting only at some seasons, as it were out of their way, unto
   duties of religion, -- it is vain to say that they make religion their
   business. But there is scarce a more certain evidence of a frame of
   mind spiritually decaying in all sorts of graces, if ever any of them
   were in it in sincerity and power, than this one, that men do not make
   religion their chiefest business. And a little self-examination will
   help men to judge what it is that they make so to be.
				</p><p>
   (3.) Lastly, I might also instance the uselessness of men in their
   profession; in want of love unto all saints, barrenness in good works,
   unreadiness and unwillingness to comply, in any extraordinary manner,
   with the calls of God unto repentance and reformation; in love of the
   world and pride of life, with passions suited unto such principles,
   predominant in them: for they are all undeniable evidences, that those
   with whom they are found had never any true grace at all, or that they
   are fallen under woeful decays. But what has been spoken may be
   sufficient unto our present purpose.
				</p><p>
   This is the third thing that was proposed, -- namely, an endeavour to
   leave convictions on the minds of some concerning their spiritual
   decays, and the necessity of seeking after a revival by the means that
   shall be insisted on. And I intend it principally for those of us who,
   under a long profession, are now come unto age, and shall not have much
   time for duty continued to us. And the truth is, I meet with none who
   are Christians of any considerable experience, and are
   spiritually-minded, but they are sensible of the danger of such decays
   in this hour of temptation, and how difficult it is, in the use of all
   means, to keep up a vigorous, active frame of mind, in faith, love,
   holiness, and fruitfulness. And for those who are not concerned herein,
   I confess I know not what to make of them, or their religion.
				</p><p>
   IV. I proceed unto that which was proposed in the fourth or last place,
   -- namely, the way and means whereby believers may be delivered from
   these decays, and come to thrive and flourish in the inward principle
   and outward fruits of spiritual life; which will bring us back unto
   consideration of that truth which we may seem to have diverted from.
   And to this end, the things ensuing are proposed unto consideration: 
				</p><p>
   1. The state of spiritual decays is recoverable. No man that is fallen
   under it has any reason to say, There is no hope, provided he take the
   right way for his recovery. If every step that is lost in the way to
   heaven should be irrecoverable, woe would be unto us; -- we should all
   assuredly perish. If there were no reparation of our breaches, no
   healing of our decays, no salvation but for them who are always
   progressive in grace; if God should mark all that is done amiss, as the
   Psalmist speaks, "O Lord, who should stand?" nay, if we had not
   recoveries every day, we should go off with a perpetual backsliding.
   But then, as was said, it is required that the right means of it be
   used, and not that which is destructive of what is designed; whereof I
   shall give an instance. When trees grow old, or are decaying, it is
   useful to dig about them, and manure them; which may cause them to
   flourish again, and abound in fruit. But instead hereof, if you remove
   them out of their soil, to plant them in another, which may promise
   much advantage, they will assuredly wither and die. So it is with
   professors, and has been with many. Finding themselves under manifold
   decays, and little or nothing of the life and power of religion left in
   them, they have grown weary of their station and have changed their
   soil, or turning from one way in religion unto another, as some have
   turned Papists, some Quakers, and the like, apprehending that fault to
   be in the religion which they professed, which was indeed only in
   themselves. You cannot give an instance of any one who did not visibly
   wither and die therein; but, had they used the proper means for their
   healing and recovery, they might have lived and brought forth fruit.
				</p><p>
   2. A strict attendance unto the severities of mortification, with all
   the duties that lead thereunto, is required unto this end; so also is
   the utmost diligence in all duties of obedience. These things naturally
   offer themselves as the first relief in this case, and they ought not
   to be omitted. But if I should insist upon them, they would branch
   themselves into such a multitude of particular directions, as it is
   inconsistent with my design here to handle. Besides, the way which I
   intend to propose is of another nature, though consistent with all the
   duties included in this proposal; yea, such as without which not one of
   them can be performed in a due manner. Wherefore, as unto these things,
   I shall only assert their necessity, with a double limitation.
				</p><p>
   (1.) That no duties of mortification be prescribed unto this end, as a
   means of recovery from spiritual decays, but what for matter and manner
   are of divine institution and command. All others are laid under a
   severe interdict, under what pretence soever they may be used. "Who
   hath required these things at your hands?" Want hereof is that whereby
   a pretended design to advance religion in the Papacy has ruined it.
   They have, under the name and pretence of the means of mortification,
   or the duties of it, invented and enjoined, like the Pharisees, a
   number of works, ways, duties, so called, which God never appointed,
   nor approved, nor will accept; nor shall they ever do good unto the
   souls of men. Such are their confessions, disciplines, pilgrimages,
   fastings, abstinence, framed prayers, to be repeated in stated
   canonical hours, in such a length and number. In the bodily labour of
   these things they exercise themselves to no spiritual advantage.
				</p><p>
   But it is natural to all men to divert to such reliefs in this case.
   Those who are thoroughly convinced of spiritual decays, are therewithal
   pressed with a sense of the guilt of sin; for it is sin which has
   brought them into that condition. Hereon, in the first place, they set
   their contrivance at work, how they may atone divine displeasure and
   obtain acceptance with God; and if they are not under the actual
   conduct of evangelical light, two things immediately offer themselves
   unto them. First, Some extraordinary course in duties, which God has
   not commanded. This is the way which they betake themselves unto in the
   Papacy, and which guilt, in the darkness of corrupted nature,
   vehemently calls for. Secondly, An extraordinary multiplication of such
   duties as, for the substance of them, are required of us. An instance
   in both kinds we have, <reference osisRef="Mic.6.6 Mic.6.7">Micah 6:6-7</reference>, "Wherewith shall I come before
   the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him
   with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? will the Lord be
   pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
   shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body
   for the sin of my soul?" And by this means they hope for a restitution
   into their former condition. And whereas spiritual decays are of two
   sorts; first, from the power and effect of convictions only, which are
   multiplied among temporary believers; and, secondly, from degrees in
   the power and effects of saving grace; -- those whose decays are of the
   first sort are never to be diverted from attempting their relief by
   such means; and when they find them fail, for the most part they cease
   contending, and abandon themselves to the power of their lusts; for
   they have no evangelical light to guide them in another course.
				</p><p>
   Unto them who are of the second sort is this direction given, in an
   endeavour for a recovery from backsliding, and thriving in grace, by a
   redoubled attendance unto the duties of mortification and new
   obedience: Let care be taken that, as unto the matter of them, they be
   of divine appointment; and as to the manner of their performance, that
   it be regulated by the rules of the Scripture. Such are constant
   reading and hearing of the Word, prayer with fervency therein, a
   diligent watch against all temptations and occasions of sin; especially
   an endeavour, by a holy earnestness, and vehement rebukes of the
   entrance of any other frame, to keep the mind spiritual and heavenly in
   its thoughts and affections.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Let them take heed that they attempt not these things in their own
   strength. When men have strong convictions that such and such things
   are their own duty, they are apt to act as if they were to be done in
   their own strength. They must do them, they will do them, -- that is,
   as unto the outward work, -- and, therefore, they think they can do
   them; that is, in a due manner. The Holy Ghost has for ever rejected
   this confidence, -- none shall prosper in it, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.5">2 Corinthians 3:5</reference>; ix. 8. But
   hereby many deceive themselves, labouring in the fire, while all they
   do does immediately perish; they have been negligent and careless,
   whereby things are come to an ill posture with them, and that peace
   which they had is impaired; but now they will pray, and read, and fast,
   and be liberal to the poor, and now strive after an abstinence from
   sin. All these things they suppose they can do of themselves, because
   they can and ought to perform the outward works, wherein the duties
   intended do consist. Hereby Christ is left out of the whole design,
   who, when all is done, is the Lord that healeth us, <reference osisRef="Exod.15.26">Exodus 15:26</reference> And
   there is another evil herein; for whatever men do in their own natural
   abilities, there is a secret reserve of some kind of merit in it. Those
   who plead for these things, do aver there can be no merit in any thing
   but what proceeds from our own free-will; and what is so done has some
   kind of merit inseparably accompanying of it; and this is enough to
   render all endeavours of this kind not only useless and fruitless, but
   utterly rejected. Faith must engage the assistance of Christ and his
   grace in and unto these duties; or, however they may be multiplied,
   they will not be effectual unto our healing and recovery. These things
   are to be used, according as we receive supplies of grace from above,
   in subordination unto that work of faith that shall be declared.
   Wherefore, --
				</p><p>
   3. The work of recovering backsliders or believers from under their
   spiritual decays is an act of sovereign grace, wrought in us by virtue
   of divine promises. Out of this eater comes meat. Because believers are
   liable to such declensions, backslidings, and decays, God has provided
   and given unto us great and precious promises of a recovery, if we duly
   apply ourselves unto the means of it. One of the places only wherein
   they are recorded I shall here call over and explain, <reference osisRef="Hos.14.1 Hos.14.2 Hos.14.3 Hos.14.4 Hos.14.5 Hos.14.6 Hos.14.7 Hos.14.8">Hosea 14:1-8</reference>, "O
   Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine
   iniquity. Take with you words, and turn unto the Lord: say unto him,
   Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render
   the calves of our lips," etc.. "I will heal their backsliding, I will
   love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. I will be as
   the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his
   roots as Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as
   the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon. They that dwell under his
   shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the
   vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim shall
   say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and
   observed him. I am like a green fir-tree: from me is thy fruit found."
				</p><p>
   The whole matter treated of in general, both as unto the disease and
   remedy, is fully stated in this passage of Scripture; and that in the
   experience of the church, and God's dealing with them; we may therefore
   receive many plain directions from it, and a safe guidance in our
   progress; which we shall endeavour to take in the ensuing
   observations: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) This application of God unto Israel, "O Israel, return," was made
   when the generality of the people were wicked, and devoted unto utter
   destruction. So it is declared in the last words of the foregoing
   chapter; and their desolation fell out not long after accordingly.
   Wherefore no season nor circumstances of things shall obstruct
   sovereign grace when God will exercise it towards his church: it shall
   work in the midst of desolating judgments.
				</p><p>
   (2.) In such a time the true Israel of God, the elect themselves, are
   apt to be overtaken with the sins of the whole, and so to backslide
   from God, and so to fall into spiritual decays. So Israel had now done,
   though she had not absolutely broken covenant with God. He was yet unto
   her "The Lord thy God;" yet she had fallen by her iniquity. Times of
   public apostasy are often accompanied with partial defects in the best:
   "Because iniquity aboundeth, the love of many shall wax cold," <reference osisRef="Matt.24.12">Matthew 24:12</reference>
				</p><p>
   (3.) When God designs to heal the backsliding of his people by
   sovereign grace, he gives them effectual calls unto repentance, and the
   use of means for their healing: so he does here by his prophet, "O
   Israel, return; take with you words." And if I could see that God did
   stir up his faithful ministers to apply themselves in a peculiar manner
   unto this work of pressing vehemently all their congregations with
   their duty herein, and let them know that there is no other way to
   prevent their ruin but by returning unto the Lord, according to the
   ways of it here prescribed, I should not doubt but that the time of
   healing were at hand.
				</p><p>
   4. The means prescribed unto this end, that our backslidings may be
   healed in a way suited unto the glory of God, is renewed repentance:
   and this acts itself, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) In fervent prayer. "Take with you words, and say." Consider the
   greatness and importance of the work before you, and weigh well what
   you do in your dealing with God. The matter of this prayer is twofold.
   [1.] The pardon of all iniquity; that is, the taking of it away; and no
   sin is omitted, all being now become equally burdensome: "Take away all
   iniquity." When the souls of sinners are in good earnest in their
   return unto God, they will leave out the consideration of no one sin
   whatever. Nor are we meet for healing, nor shall we apply ourselves
   unto it in a due manner, without some previous sense of the love of God
   in the pardon of our sin. [2.] Gracious acceptation: "Receive us
   graciously." The words in the original are only vqch tvv. "And receive
   good;" but both the words being used variously, the sense eminently
   included in them is well expressed by -- "Receive us graciously." After
   we have cast ourselves under tokens of thy displeasure, now let us know
   that we are freely accepted with thee. And this also lies in the
   desires of them who design to obtain a healing of their backslidings;
   for under them they are sensible that they are obnoxious unto God's
   displeasure.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Affectionate confessions of the sin wherein their backslidings did
   consist, or which were the occasions of them. "Asshur shall not save
   us;" -- "We will say no more to the work of our hands, Ye are our
   gods." Fleshly confidence and false worship were the two great sins
   that had now ruined the body of the people. These believers themselves
   had an accession unto them more or less, as now they have unto the
   prevailing sins of the days wherein we live, by conformity unto the
   world. Of these sins God expecteth a full and free confession, in order
   unto our healing.
				</p><p>
   (3.) A renewed covenant engagement to renounce all other hopes and
   expectation, and to betake themselves with their whole trust and
   confidence unto him; whereof they express, first, the cause, which was
   his mere grace and mercy, "For in thee the fatherless findeth mercy;"
   and, secondly, the effect of it, which is praise and thanksgiving, "So
   will we render the calves of our lips." And some things we may hence
   farther observe as unto the case under consideration. As, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] Although God will repair our spiritual decays and heal our
   backslidings freely, yet he will do it so, or in such a way, as wherein
   he may communicate grace unto us, to the praise of his own glory.
   Therefore are these duties prescribed unto us in order thereunto; for
   although they are not the procuring cause of the love and grace from
   whence alone we are healed, yet are they required, in the method of the
   dispensation of grace, to precede the effect of them. Nor have we
   anywhere a more illustrious instance and testimony of the consistency
   and harmony which is between sovereign grace and the diligent discharge
   of our duty than we have in this place; for as God promiseth that he
   would heal their backslidings out of his free love, verse 4, and would
   do it by the communication of effectual grace, verse 5, so he enjoins
   them all these duties in order thereunto.
				</p><p>
   [2.] That unless we find these things wrought in us in a way of
   preparation for the receiving of the mercy desired, we have no firm
   ground of expectation that we shall be made partakers of it; for this
   is the method of God's dealing with the church. Then, and then only, we
   may expect a gracious reviving from all our decays, when serious
   repentance, working in the ways declared, is found in us. This grace
   will not surprise us in our sloth, negligence, and security, but will
   make way for itself by stirring us up unto sincere endeavours after it
   in the perseverance of these duties. And until we see better evidences
   of this repentance among us than as yet appears, we can have but small
   hopes of a general recovery from our present decays.
				</p><p>
   5. The work itself is declared, -- (1.) By its nature; (2.) In its
   causes; (3.) From its effects.
				</p><p>
   (1.) In the nature of it, it is the healing of backslidings: "I will
   heal their backsliding," -- the sin whereby they are fallen off from
   God, unto whom they are now exhorted to return. These bring the souls
   of men into a diseased state and danger of death: the cure hereof is
   the work of God alone. Hence he gives himself that title, "I am the
   Lord that healeth thee," <reference osisRef="Exod.15.26">Exodus 15:26</reference> And because of the poisonous
   nature of sin, and the danger it brings of eternal death unto the souls
   of men, the removal of it, or a recovery from it, is often called by
   the name of healing, <reference osisRef="Ps.6.2">Psalms 6:2</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.57.18 Isa.57.19">Isaiah 57:18-19</reference>; <reference osisRef="Hos.6.1">Hosea 6:1</reference> Here it
   includeth two things: first, the pardon of sin past; and then, a supply
   of grace to make us fruitful in obedience: "I will be as the dew to
   Israel;" as we shall see. This is God's healing of backslidings.
				</p><p>
   (2.) In the causes of it, which are, -- 1. The principal moving cause;
   and that is, free, undeserved love: "I will love them freely." From
   hence alone is our recovery to be expected. 2. The efficient cause;
   which, as unto sins past, is pardoning mercy: "Mine anger is turned
   away from him;" -- and as unto renewed obedience, in which too our
   recovery consists, it is in a plentiful supply of effectual grace: "I
   will be as the dew unto Israel." Fresh supplies of the Spirit of grace
   from above are so expressed; this is necessary unto our healing and
   recovery.
				</p><p>
   (3.) It is described by its effect, which is a much more abundant
   fruitfulness in holiness and obedience, in peace and love, than ever
   they had before attained. This the prophet sets out in multiplied
   similitudes and metaphors, to denote the greatness and efficacy of
   grace so communicated.
				</p><p>
   I have a little insisted on the opening of the context, for sundry
   reasons.
				</p><p>
   1. The case which I would consider is in all the parts of it stated
   distinctly, and represented clearly unto us. There is nothing remains,
   but only the especial way whereby, in the exercise of faith, this grace
   may be obtained; which is that which I shall speak unto in the last
   place, as that which is principally intended in this Discourse.
				</p><p>
   2. That I might show how great a thing it is to have our spiritual
   decays made up, our backslidings healed, and so to attain the vigorous
   acting of grace and spiritual life, with a flourishing profession and
   fruitful obedience, in old age. It is so set forth here by the Holy
   Ghost, as that every one must needs have a sense of the beauty and
   glory of the work: it is that which divine love, mercy, and grace, are
   eminently effectual in unto the glory of God, -- that which so many
   duties are required to prepare us for. Let no man think that it is a
   light or common work; every thing in it is peculiar: it is, unto them
   who are made partakers of it, a life from the dead.
				</p><p>
   3. That none may utterly despond under their decays. When persons are
   awakened by new convictions, and begin to feel the weight of them, and
   how implicately they are entangled with them, they are ready to faint,
   and even to despair of deliverance. But we see that here is a promise
   of deliverance from them by pardoning mercy, and also of such fresh
   springs of grace as shall cause us to abound in holiness and
   fruitfulness. Who is it that is entangled with corruptions and
   temptations, that groans under a sense of a cold, lifeless, barren
   frame of heart? He may take in spiritual refreshment, if by faith he
   can make application of this promise unto himself.
				</p><p>
   4. That which remains, is to declare the particular way whereby, in the
   exercise of faith, we may obtain the fruit of this and all other
   promises of the like nature, unto the end so often proposed, -- namely,
   of being flourishing and fruitful even in old age. Now, supposing a due
   attendance unto the duties mentioned, I shall give some directions with
   respect unto that which gives life, power, and efficacy unto them all,
   and which will infallibly bring us unto the full enjoyment of this
   signal mercy; and they are these that follow: 
				</p><p>
   1. All our supplies of grace are from Jesus Christ. Grace is declared
   in the promises of the Old Testament; but the way of its communication,
   and our receiving of it, is revealed unto us in the New. This belongs
   to the mystery of it, that all grace is from Christ, and shall be in
   vain expected any other way. He has assured us, that "without him we
   can do nothing;" we can no more bring forth fruit, than a branch can
   that is separated from the vine, <reference osisRef="John.15.3 John.15.4 John.15.5">John 15:3-5</reference> He is our head, and all
   our spiritual influences -- that is, divine communication of grace --
   are from him alone. He is our life efficiently, and liveth in us
   effectively, so as that our ability for vital acts is from him, <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.3.1 Col.3.2 Col.3.3 Col.3.4">Colossians 3:1-4</reference> Are we, then, any of us under convictions of
   spiritual decays? or do we long for such renovations of spiritual
   strength as may make us flourish in faith, love, and holiness? We must
   know assuredly, that nothing of all this can be attained, but it must
   come from Jesus Christ alone. We see what promises are made, what
   duties are prescribed unto us; but however we should endeavour to apply
   ourselves unto the one or the other, they would yield us no relief,
   unless we know how to receive it from Christ himself.
				</p><p>
   2. The only way of receiving supplies of spiritual strength and grace
   from Jesus Christ, on our part, is by faith. Hereby we come unto him,
   are implanted in him, abide with him, so as to bring forth fruit. He
   dwells in our hearts by faith, and he acts in us by faith, and we live
   by faith in or on the Son of God. This, I suppose, will be granted,
   that if we receive any thing from Christ, it must be by faith, it must
   be in the exercise of it, or in a way of believing; nor is there any
   one word in the Scripture that gives the least encouragement to expect
   either grace or mercy from him in any other way, or by any other means.
				</p><p>
   3. This faith respects the person of Christ, his grace, his whole
   mediation, with all the effects of it, and his glory in them all. This
   is that which has been so much insisted on in the foregoing Discourses
   as that it ought not to be again insisted upon. This, therefore, is the
   issue of the whole:  a steady view of the glory of Christ, in his
   person, grace, and office, through faith, -- or a constant, lively
   exercise of faith on him, according as he is revealed unto us in the
   Scripture, -- is the only effectual way to obtain a revival from under
   our spiritual decays, and such supplies of grace as shall make us
   flourishing and fruitful even in old age. He that thus lives by faith
   in him shall, by his spiritual thriving and growth, "show that the Lord
   is upright, that he is our rock, and that there is no unrighteousness
   in him."
				</p><p>
   We may consider briefly, -- first, how this is testified unto in the
   Scripture; and then, what are the ways whereby this grace or duty will
   produce this effect; and so put a close unto this part of the
   application of the sacred truth before declared.
				</p><p>
   1. This direction is given us, <reference osisRef="Ps.34.5">Psalms 34:5</reference>, "They looked unto him, and
   were lightened; and their faces were not ashamed." That it is Christ,
   or the glory of God in him, that is thus looked unto, I need not prove,
   -- it will not be denied. And it is their faith which is expressed by
   their looking unto him; which is nothing but that beholding of his
   glory which we have described: for it is an act of trust arising from
   an apprehension of who and what he is. The issue or effect hereof is,
   that they were lightened; that is, received fresh communication of
   spiritual, saving, refreshing light from him, and, consequently, of all
   other graces, whence their faces were not ashamed: nor shall we fail in
   our expectation of new spiritual communication in the exercise of the
   same faith.
				</p><p>
   This is that which we are called unto, <reference osisRef="Isa.45.22">Isaiah 45:22</reference>, "Look unto me, and
   be saved, all ye ends of the earth." On this look to Christ, on this
   view of his glory, depends our whole salvation; and therefore all
   things that are needful thereunto do so also: this is the way whereby
   we receive grace and glory. This is the direction given us by the Holy
   Ghost for the attaining of them.
				</p><p>
   So is the same duty described, <reference osisRef="Mic.7.7">Micah 7:7</reference>, "Therefore I will look
   unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will
   hear me." The church knew not any other way of relief, whatever her
   distresses were.
				</p><p>
   A look unto Christ as crucified (and how glorious he was therein, has
   been declared) is made the cause and fountain of that godly sorrow
   which is a spring unto all other graces, especially in those who have
   fallen under decays, <reference osisRef="Zech.12.10">Zechariah 12:10</reference>; and it is so also of desiring
   strength from him, to enable us to endure all our trials, troubles, and
   afflictions, with patience unto the end, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.2">Hebrews 12:2</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. The only inquiry remaining, is, how a constant view of the glory of
   Christ will produce this blessed effect in us: and it will do so
   several ways.
				</p><p>
   1. It will be effected by that transforming power and efficacy which
   this exercise of faith is always accompanied withal. This is that which
   changeth us every day more and more into the likeness of Christ, as has
   been at large before declared. Herein all revivals and all flourishing
   are contained. To have a good measure of conformity unto Christ is all
   whereof in this life we are capable: the perfection of it is eternal
   blessedness. According as are our attainments therein, so is the
   thriving and flourishing of the life of grace in us; which is that
   which is aimed at. Other ways and means, it may be, have failed us, let
   us put this to the trial. Let us live in the constant contemplation of
   the glory of Christ, and virtue will proceed from him to repair all our
   decays, to renew a right spirit within us, and to cause us to abound in
   all duties of obedience. This way of producing these effects flesh and
   blood will not reveal, -- it looks like washing in Jordan to cure a
   leprosy; but the life of faith is a mystery known only unto them in
   whom it is.
				</p><p>
   2. It will fix the soul unto that object which is suited to give it
   delight, complacency, and satisfaction. This in perfection is
   blessedness, for it is caused by the eternal vision of the glory of God
   in Christ; and the nearer approaches we make unto this state, the
   better, the more spiritual, the more heavenly, is the state of our
   souls. And this is to be obtained only by a constant contemplation of
   the glory of Christ, as has been declared. And it is several ways
   effectual unto the end now proposed. For, --
				</p><p>
   1. The most of our spiritual decays and barrenness arise from an
   inordinate admission of other things into our minds; for these are they
   that weaken grace in all its operations. But when the mind is filled
   with thoughts of Christ and his glory, when the soul thereon cleaves
   unto him with intense affections, they will cast out, or not give
   admittance unto, those causes of spiritual weakness and indisposition.
   See <reference osisRef="Col.3.1 Col.3.2 Col.3.3 Col.3.4 Col.3.5">Colossians 3:1-5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.5.8">Ephesians 5:8</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. Where we are engaged in this duty, it will stir up every grace unto
   its due exercise; which is that wherein the spiritual revival inquired
   after does consist. This is all we desire, all we long for, this will
   make us fat and flourishing, -- namely, that every grace of the Spirit
   have its due exercise in us. See <reference osisRef="Rom.5.3 Rom.5.4 Rom.5.5">Romans 5:3-5</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.5 2Pet.1.6 2Pet.1.7 2Pet.1.8">2 Peter 1:5-8</reference> Whereas,
   therefore, Christ himself is the first proper, adequate object of all
   grace, and all its exercise (for it first respects him, and then other
   things for him), when the mind is fixed on him and his glory, every
   grace will be in a readiness for its due exercise. And without this we
   shall never attain it by any resolutions or endeavours of our own, let
   us make the trial when we please.
				</p><p>
   3. This will assuredly put us on a vigilant watch and constant conflict
   against all the deceitful workings of sin, against all the entrances of
   temptation, against all the ways and means of surprisals into foolish
   frames, by vain imaginations which are the causes of our decays. Our
   recovery or revival will not be effected, nor a fresh spring of grace
   be obtained, in a careless, slothful course of profession. Constant
   watching, fighting, contending against sin, with our utmost endeavour
   for an absolute conquest over it, are required hereunto. And nothing
   will so much excite and encourage our souls hereunto as a constant view
   of Christ and his glory; every thing in him has a constraining power
   hereunto, as is known to all who have any acquaintance with these
   things.</p>
