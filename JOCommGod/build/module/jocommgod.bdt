<title>Prefatory note.</title>
<p>   The reader may be referred to the Life of Dr Owen (vol. i. p. lxxii.)
   for a general criticism on the merits of the following treatise. It was
   published in 1657, shortly after he had ceased to be Vice-Chancellor in
   the University of Oxford. From the brief preface affixed to it, it
   appears that, for a period of more than six years, he had been under
   some engagement to publish the substance of the work. It has been
   inferred, accordingly, that it is the substance of some discourses
   which he had preached in Oxford; but, as he became Vice-Chancellor only
   in September 1652, there is more probability in the supposition that
   they are the discourses which refreshed and cheered his attached
   congregation at Coggeshall.
				</p><p>
   There are two peculiarities which deserve attention in the treatise.
   The oversight of one of them has created some misconceptions of the
   author's design, and led some to fancy that he was wandering from it,
   in various passages which are in strict harmony with his main and
   original purpose of the work. The term "Communion," as used by Owen, is
   used in a wider sense than is consistent with that which is now
   generally attached to it in religious phraseology. It denotes not
   merely the interchange of feeling between God on his gracious character
   and a soul in a gracious state, but the gracious relationship upon
   which this holy interchange is based. On the part of Christ, for
   example, all his work and its results are described, from the atonement
   till it takes effect in the actual justification of the sinner.
				</p><p>
   The grand peculiarity distinguishing the treatise is its fullness of
   illustration with which he dilates on the communion enjoyed by
   believers with each person of the Godhead respectively. Fully to
   comprehend his views on this point, it is needful to bear in mind the
   meaning under which the word Communion is employed by Owen.
</p>

<title>Analysis.</title>
<p>   Part I. -- The fact of communion with God is asserted, chap. i.
   Passages in Scripture are quoted to show that special mention is made
   of communion with all the persons of the Trinity ii. Communion with the
   Father is described, iii.; and practical inferences deduced from it,
   iv.
				</p><p>
   Part II. -- The reality of communion with Christ is proved chap. i.;
   and the nature of it is subsequently considered, ii. It is shown to
   consist in grace; and then the grace of Christ is exhibited under three
   divisions:  his personal grace, iii.-vi.; and under this branch are
   two long digressions, designed to unfold the glory and loveliness of
   Christ; -- purchased grace, vii.-x.; in which the mediatorial work of
   Christ is fully considered, in reference to our acceptance with God,
   vii., viii.; sanctification, ix.; and the privileges of the covenant,
   x.; -- and grace as communicated by the Spirit, and conspicuous in the
   fruits of personal holiness. This last division is illustrated under
   sanctification, as contained under the head of purchased grace.
				</p><p>
   Part III. -- Communion with the Holy Ghost is expounded in the eight
   following chapters; -- the foundation of it, chap. i.; his gracious and
   effectual influence in believers, ii.; the elements in which it
   consists, iii.; the effects in the hearts of believers, iv.; and
   general inferences and particular directions for communion with the
   Spirit, v.-viii.
				</p><p>
   The arrangement of the treatise may seem involved and complicated, and
   the endless divisions and subdivisions may distract rather than assist
   the attention of the reader. The warm glow of sanctified emotion,
   however, and occasionally thoughts of singular power and originality,
   which are found throughout the treatise, sustain the interest, and more
   than reward perusal. Few passages in any theological writer are more
   thrilling than the reference to the spotless humanity of Christ, in
   terms full of sanctified genius, on page 64.
				</p><p>
   An account of the strange controversy to which this treatise gave rise,
   many years after its publication, will be found on page 276. -- Ed.

<title>Preface.</title>
<p>   Christian Reader,
				</p><p>
   It is now six years past since I was brought under an engagement of
   promise for the publishing of some meditations on the subject which
   you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> find handled in the ensuing treatise. The reasons of this
   delay, being not of public concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>, I shall not need to mention.
   Those who have been in expectation of this duty from me, have, for the
   most part, been so far acquainted with my condition and employments, as
   to be able to satisfy themselves as to the deferring of their desires.
   That which I have to add at present is only this:  having had many
   opportunities, since the time I first delivered any thing in public on
   this subject (which was the means of bringing me under the engagements
   mentioned), to re-assume the consideration of what I had first fixed
   on, I have been enabled to give it that improvement, and to make those
   additions to the main of the design and matter treated on, that my
   first debt is come at length to be only the occasion of what is now
   tendered to the saints of God. I shall speak nothing of the subject
   here handled; it may, I hope, speak for itself, in that spiritual
   savour and relish which it will yield to them whose hearts are not so
   filled with other things as to render the sweet things of the gospel
   bitter to them. The design of the whole treatise you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> find,
   Christian reader, in the first chapters of the first part; and I shall
   not detain you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> here with the perusal of any thing which in its proper
   place will offer itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>: know only, that the whole of it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   been recommended to the grace of God in many supplications, for its
   usefulness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that are interested in the good things mentioned
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.

<title>To the reader.</title>
<p>   Alphonsus, king of Spain, is said to have found food and physic in
   reading Livy; and Ferdinand, king of Sicily, in reading Quintus
   Curtius: but you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> here nobler entertainments, vastly richer
   dainties, incomparably more sovereign medicines; -- I had almost said,
   the very highest of angel's food is here set before you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>; and, as Pliny
   speaks, "permista deliciis auxilia," -- things that minister to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> grace
   and comfort, to holy life and liveliness.
				</p><p>
   Such is this treatise, -- this, which is the only one extant upon its
   great and necessary subject, -- this, whose praise has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been long in
   the churches, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> gone enamelled with the honourable reproaches of
   more than one English Bolsec, -- this, whose great author, like the
   sun, is well known to the world, by eminence of heavenly light and
   labours, -- this, which, as his many other works, can be no other than
   manna to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sound Christians, though no better than stone and serpent to
   Socinians and their fellow-commoners.
				</p><p>
   Importunity has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> drawn me to say thus much more than I could think
   needful to be said concerning any work of Dr Owen's; -- needful in our
   day itself, a day in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> "pauci sacras Scripturas, plures nomina
   rerum, plurimi nomina magistrorum sequuntur;" -- "few do cleave to the
   holy Scriptures; many do rest in scholastic senseless sounds; and most
   men do hang their faith upon their rabbi's sleeves."
				</p><p>
   This only I add:  of the swarms every day rising, there are few books
   but do want their readers; yet if I understand aright, there are not
   many readers but do want this book.
				</p><p>
   In which censure I think I am no tyrant, which the philosopher names
   the worst of wild beasts; I am sure I am no flatterer, which he calls
   justly, the worst of tame beasts, -- Kai tauta men de tauta.
				</p><p>
   Let the simple souls (the "paucissimae lectionis mancipia") who take
   the doctrine of distinct communion with the Divine Persons to be a
   new-fangled one and uncouth, observe the words of the Rev. Samuel
   Clarke (the annotator on the Bible), in his sermon on <reference osisRef="1John.1.7">1 John 1:7</reference>: "It
   is to be noted, that there is a distinct fellowship with each of the
   persons of the blessed Trinity." Let them attend what is said by Mr
   Lewis Stuckley, in his preface to Mr Polwheil's book of Quenching the
   Spirit: "It is a most glorious truth, though considered but by a few,
   that believers have, or may have, distinct communion with the three
   persons, Father, Son, and Spirit. This is attested by the finger of
   God, and solemnly owned by the first and best age of Christianity." To
   name no more, let them read heedfully but the second chapter of this
   treatise, and it is hoped that then they shall no longer "contra
   antidotum insanire," -- no longer rage against God's holy medicinal
   truth, as St Austin says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he did while he was a Manichee; testifying,
   in so many words, [that] his error was his very god.
				</p><p>
   Reader, I am
   Your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> servant in Christ Jesus,

<title>Part I. Of Communion with each Person distinctly -- Of Communion with the Father</title>
<p></p>

<title>Part 1 Chapter 1</title>
<p>
   That the saints have communion with God -- <reference osisRef="1John.1.3">1 John 1:3</reference> considered to
   that purpose -- Somewhat of the nature of communion in general.
				</p><p>
   In the First Epistle of John, chap. i., verse 3, the apostle assures
   them to whom he wrote that the fellowship of believers "is with the
   Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:" [2] and this he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> with such
   an unusual kind of expression as bears the force of an asseveration;
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> we have rendered it, "Truly our fellowship is with the Father,
   and with his Son Jesus Christ."
				</p><p>
   The outward appearance and condition of the saints in those days being
   very mean and contemptible, -- their leaders being accounted as the
   filth of this world, and as the offscouring of all things, [3] -- the
   inviting others to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> fellowship with them, and a participation of the
   precious things which they did enjoy, seems to be exposed to many
   contrary reasonings and objections: "What benefit is there in communion
   with them? Is it any thing else but to be sharers in troubles,
   reproaches, scorns, and all manner of evils?" To prevent or remove
   these and the like exceptions, the apostle gives them to whom he wrote
   to know (and that with some earnestness of expression), that
   notwithstanding all the disadvantages their fellowship lay under, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   a carnal view, yet in truth it was, and would be found to be (in
   reference to some with whom they held it), very honourable, glorious,
   and desirable. For "truly," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "our fellowship is with the
   Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
				</p><p>
   This being so earnestly and directly asserted by the apostle, we may
   boldly follow him with our affirmation, -- namely, "That the saints of
   God have communion with him." And a holy and spiritual communion it is,
   as shall be declared. How this is spoken distinctly in reference to the
   Father and the Son, must afterward be fully opened and carried on.
				</p><p>
   By nature, since the entrance of sin, no man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any communion with
   God. He is light, [4] we darkness; and what communion has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> light with
   darkness? He is life, we are dead, -- he is love, and we are enmity;
   and what agreement can there be between us? Men in such a condition
   have neither Christ, [5] nor hope, nor God in the world, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.12">Ephesians 2:12</reference>;
   "being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in
   them," chap. iv. 18. Now, two cannot walk together, unless they be
   agreed, <reference osisRef="Amos.3.3">Amos 3:3</reference> While<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> there is this distance between God and man,
   there is no walking together for them in any fellowship or communion.
   Our first interest in God was so lost by sin, [6] as that there was
   left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us (in ourselves) no possibility of a recovery. As we had
   deprived ourselves of all power for a returnal, so God had not revealed
   any way of access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself; or that he could, under any
   consideration, be approached to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> by sinners in peace. Not any work
   that God had made, not any attribute that he had revealed, could give
   the least light into such a dispensation.
				</p><p>
   The manifestation of grace and pardoning mercy, which is the only door
   of entrance into any such communion, is not committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any but to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him alone [7] in whom it is, by whom that grace and mercy was
   purchased, through whom it is dispensed, who reveals it from the bosom
   of the Father. Hence this communion and fellowship with God is not in
   express terms mentioned in the Old Testament. The thing itself is found
   there; but the clear light of it, and the boldness of faith in it, is
   discovered in the gospel, and by the Spirit administered in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. By
   that Spirit we have this liberty, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.17-2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:17-18</reference> Abraham was the
   friend of God, <reference osisRef="Isa.41.8">Isaiah 41:8</reference>; David, a man after his own heart; Enoch
   walked with him, <reference osisRef="Gen.5.22">Genesis 5:22</reference>; -- all enjoying this communion and
   fellowship for the substance of it. But the way into the holiest was
   not yet made manifest while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> the first tabernacle was standing, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.8">Hebrews 9:8</reference> Though they had communion with God, yet they had not parrhesian,
   -- a boldness and confidence in that communion. This follows the
   entrance of our High Priest into the most holy place, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.16">Hebrews 4:16</reference>, x.
   19. The vail also was upon them, that they had not eleutherian, freedom
   and liberty in their access to God, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.15-2Cor.3.16">2 Corinthians 3:15-16</reference>, etc. But now in
   Christ we have [8] boldness and access with confidence to God, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.12">Ephesians 3:12</reference> This boldness and access with confidence the saints of old
   were not acquainted with. By Jesus Christ alone, then, on all
   considerations as to being and full manifestation, is this distance
   taken away. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> consecrated for us a new and living way (the old
   being quite shut up), "through the vail, that is to say, his flesh,"
   <reference osisRef="Heb.10.20">Hebrews 10:20</reference>; and "through him we have access by one Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Father," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference> "Ye who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by
   the blood of Christ, for he is our peace," etc., verses 13, 14. Of this
   foundation of all our communion with God, more afterward, and at large.
   Upon this new bottom and foundation, by this new and living way, are
   sinners admitted into communion with God, and have fellowship with him.
   And truly, for sinners to have fellowship with God, the infinitely holy
   God, is an astonishing dispensation. [9] To speak a little of it in
   general:  Communion relates to things and persons. A joint
   participation in any thing whatever, good or evil, [10] duty or
   enjoyment, nature or actions, gives this denomination to them so
   partaking of it. A common interest in the same nature gives all men a
   fellowship or communion in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. Of the elect it is said, Ta paidia
   kekoinoneke sarkos kai haimatos, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference>, "Those children partook
   of" (or had fellowship in, with the rest of the world) "flesh and
   blood," -- the same common nature with the rest of mankind; and,
   therefore, Christ also came into the same fellowship: Kai autos
   paraplesios metesche ton auton. There is also a communion as to state
   and condition, whether it be good or evil; and this, either in things
   internal and spiritual, -- such as is the communion of saints among
   themselves; or in respect of outward things. So was it with Christ and
   the two thieves, as to one condition, and to one of them in respect of
   another. They were en to auto krimati, -- under the same sentence to
   the cross, <reference osisRef="Luke.23.40">Luke 23:40</reference>, "ejusdem dolores socii." They had communion
   as to that evil condition to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they were adjudged; and one of them
   requested (which he also obtained) a participation in that blessed
   condition whereupon our Saviour was immediately to enter. There is also
   a communion or fellowship in actions, whether good or evil. In good, is
   that communion and fellowship in the gospel, or in the performance and
   celebration of that worship of God which in the gospel is instituted;
   which the saints do enjoy, <reference osisRef="Phil.1.5">Philippians 1:5</reference>; which, as to the general kind of
   it, David so rejoices in, <reference osisRef="Ps.42.4">Psalms 42:4</reference> In evil, was that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Simeon
   and Levi were brethren, <reference osisRef="Gen.49.5">Genesis 49:5</reference> They had communion in that cruel
   act of revenge and murder. Our communion with God is not comprised in
   any one of these kinds; of some of them it is exclusive. It cannot be
   natural; it must be voluntary and by consent. It cannot be of state and
   conditions; but in actions. It cannot be in the same actions upon a
   third party; but in a return from one to another. The infinite
   disparity that is between God and man, made the great philosopher
   conclude that there could be no friendship between them. [11] Some
   distance in the persons holding friendship he could allow, nor could
   exactly determine the bounds and extent of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; but that between God
   and man, in his apprehension, left no place for it. Another says,
   indeed, that there is "communitas homini cum Deo," -- a certain
   fellowship between God and man; but the general intercourse of
   providence is all he apprehended. Some arose to higher expressions; but
   they understood nothing of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> they spake. This knowledge is hid in
   Christ; as will afterward be made to appear. It is too wonderful for
   nature, as sinful and corrupted. Terror and apprehensions of death at
   the presence of God is all that it guides to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. But we have, as was
   said, a new foundation, and a new discovery of this privilege.
				</p><p>
   Now, communion is the mutual communication of such good things as
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the persons holding that communion are delighted, bottomed upon
   some union between them. So it was with Jonathan and David; their souls
   clave to one another (<reference osisRef="1Sam.20.17">1 Samuel 20:17</reference>) in love. [12] There was the union
   of love between them; and then they really communicated all issues of
   love mutually. [13] In spiritual things this is more eminent: those who
   enjoy this communion have the most excellent union for the foundation
   of it; and the issues of that union, which they mutually communicate,
   are the most precious and eminent.
				</p><p>
   Of the union which is the foundation of all that communion we have with
   God I have spoken largely elsewhere, and have nothing farther to add
   to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Our communion, then, with God consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in his communication of
   himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, with our returnal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him of that which he requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>
   and accepts<note n="accepteth">Auto-modernized</note>, flowing from that union [14] which in Jesus Christ we
   have with him. And it is twofold:  1. Perfect and complete, in the
   full fruition of his glory and total giving up of ourselves to him,
   resting in him as our utmost end; which we shall enjoy when we see him
   as he is; -- and, 2. Initial and incomplete, in the first-fruits and
   dawnings of that perfection which we have here in grace; which only I
   shall handle.
				</p><p>
   It is, then, I say, of that mutual communication [15] in giving and
   receiving, after a most holy and spiritual manner, which is between God
   and the saints while they walk together in a covenant of peace,
   ratified in the blood of Jesus, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are to treat. And this we
   shall do, if God permit; in the meantime praying the God and Father of
   our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, of the riches of his
   grace, recovered us from a state of enmity into a condition of
   communion and fellowship with himself, that both he that writes, and
   they that read the words of his mercy, may have such a taste of his
   sweetness and excellencies in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, as to be stirred up to a farther
   longing after the fulness of his salvation, and the eternal fruition of
   him in glory.

<p>
   That the saints have this communion distinctly with the Father, Son,
   and Spirit, <reference osisRef="1John.5.7">1 John 5:7</reference> opened to this purpose; also, <reference osisRef="1Cor.12.4-1Cor.12.6">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</reference>,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference> -- Father and Son mentioned jointly in this communion; the
   Father solely, the Son also, and the Holy Ghost singly -- The saints'
   respective reward in all worship to each person manifested -- Faith in
   the Father, <reference osisRef="John.5.9-John.5.10">John 5:9-10</reference>; and love towards him, <reference osisRef="1John.2.15">1 John 2:15</reference>, <reference osisRef="Mal.1.6">Malachi 1:6</reference> -- So in prayer and praise -- It is so likewise with the Son, <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference> -- Of our communion with the Holy Ghost -- The truth farther
   confirmed.
				</p><p>
   That the saints have communion with God, and what communion in general
   is, was declared in the first chapter. The manner how this communion is
   carried on, and the matter in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist, comes next under
   consideration. For the first, in respect of the distinct persons of the
   Godhead with whom they have this fellowship, it is either distinct and
   peculiar, or else obtained and exercised jointly and in common. That
   the saints have distinct communion with the Father, and the Son, and
   the Holy Spirit (that is, distinctly with the Father, and distinctly
   with the Son, and distinctly with the Holy Spirit), and in what the
   peculiar appropriation of this distinct communion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the several
   persons does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist, must, in the first place, be made manifest. [16]
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="1John.5.7">1 John 5:7</reference>, the apostle tells us, "There are three that bear record in
   heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost." In heaven they are,
   and bear witness to us. And what is it that they bear witness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>?
   To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the sonship of Christ, and the salvation of believers in his
   blood. Of the carrying on of that, both by blood and water,
   justification and sanctification, is he there treating. Now, how do
   they bear witness to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>? even as three, as three distinct witnesses.
   When God witnesses<note n="witnesseth">Auto-modernized</note> concerning our salvation, surely it is incumbent on
   us to receive his testimony. And as he bears<note n="beareth">Auto-modernized</note> witness, so are we to
   receive it. Now this is done distinctly. The Father bears<note n="beareth">Auto-modernized</note> witness,
   the Son bears<note n="beareth">Auto-modernized</note> witness, and the Holy Spirit bears<note n="beareth">Auto-modernized</note> witness; for they
   are three distinct witnesses. So, then, are we to receive their several
   testimonies: and in doing so we have communion with them severally; for
   in this giving and receiving of testimony consists no small part of our
   fellowship with God. In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> their distinct witnessing consists will be
   afterward declared.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="1Cor.12.4-1Cor.12.6">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</reference>, the apostle, speaking of the distribution of gifts and
   graces to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints, ascribes them distinctly, in respect of the
   fountain of their communication, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the distinct persons. "There are
   diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit," [17] -- "that one and the
   self-same Spirit;" that is, the Holy Ghost, verse 11. "And there are
   differences of administrations, but the same Lord," the same Lord
   Jesus, verse 5. "And there are diversities of operations, but it is the
   same God," etc., even the Father, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.6">Ephesians 4:6</reference> So graces and gifts are
   bestowed, and so are they received.
				</p><p>
   And not only in the emanation of grace from God, and the illapses of
   the Spirit on us, but also in all our approaches to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, is the same
   distinction observed. [18] "For through Christ we have access by one
   Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference> Our access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God (in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we
   have communion with him) is dia Christou, "through Christ," en
   Pneumati, "in the Spirit," and pros ton Patera, "to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father;" --
   the persons being here considered as engaged distinctly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   accomplishment of the counsel of the will of God revealed in the
   gospel.
				</p><p>
   Sometimes, indeed, there is express mention made only of the Father and
   the Son, <reference osisRef="1John.1.3">1 John 1:3</reference>, "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his
   Son Jesus Christ." The particle "and" is both distinguishing and
   uniting. Also <reference osisRef="John.14.23">John 14:23</reference>, "If a man love me, he will keep my words:
   and my Father will love him, and we will come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and make our
   abode with him." It is in this communion in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Father and Son do make
   their abode with the soul.
				</p><p>
   Sometimes the Son only is spoken of, as to this purpose. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.9">1 Corinthians 1:9</reference>,
   "God is faithful, by whom ye were called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the fellowship of his Son
   Jesus Christ our Lord." And, <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference>, "If any man hear my voice,
   and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
   with me;" -- of which place afterward.
				</p><p>
   Sometimes the Spirit alone is mentioned. <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.14">2 Corinthians 13:14</reference>, "The grace of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the
   Holy Ghost be with you all." This distinct communion, then, of the
   saints with the Father, Son, and Spirit, is very plain in the
   Scripture; but yet it may admit of farther demonstration. Only this
   caution I must lay in beforehand:  whatever is affirmed in the pursuit
   of this truth, it is done with relation to the explanation ensuing, in
   the beginning of the next chapter.
				</p><p>
   The way and means, then, on the part of the saints, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> in Christ
   they enjoy communion with God, are all the spiritual and holy actings
   [19] and outgoings of their souls in those graces, and by those ways,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> both the moral and instituted worship of God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist.
   Faith, love, trust, joy, etc., are the natural or moral worship of God,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> those in whom they are have communion with him. Now, these are
   either immediately acted on God, and not tied to any ways or means
   outwardly manifesting themselves; or else they are farther drawn forth,
   in solemn prayer and praises, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that way which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   appointed. That the Scripture does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> distinctly assign all these to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Father, Son, and Spirit, -- manifesting that the saints do, in all of
   them, both as they are purely and nakedly moral, and as farther clothed
   with instituted worship, respect each person respectively, -- is that
   which, to give light to the assertion in hand, I shall farther declare
   by particular instances: 
				</p><p>
   1. For the Father. Faith, love, obedience, etc., are peculiarly and
   distinctly yielded by the saints to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; and he is peculiarly
   manifested in those ways as acting peculiarly towards them: which
   should draw them forth and stir them up to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. He gives testimony
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and bears<note n="beareth">Auto-modernized</note> witness of, his Son, <reference osisRef="1John.5.9">1 John 5:9</reference>, "This is the
   witness of God which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> testified of his Son." In his bearing
   witness he is an object of belief. When he gives testimony (which he
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> as the Father, because he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it of the Son) he is to he received
   in it by faith. And this is affirmed, verse 10, "He that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> on
   the Son of God, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the witness in himself." To believe on the Son of
   God in this place, is to receive the Lord Christ as the Son, the Son
   given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, [20] for all the ends of the Father's love, upon the
   credit of the Father's testimony; and, therefore, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is faith
   immediately acted on the Father. So it follows in the next words, "he
   that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> not God" (that is, the Father, who bears witness to the
   Son) "has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made him a liar." "Ye believe in God," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> our Saviour,
   <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>; that is, the Father as such, for he adds, "Believe also in
   me;" or, "Believe you in God; believe also in me." God, as the prima
   Veritas, upon whose authority is founded, and to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> all divine
   faith is ultimately resolved, is not to be considered hupostatikos, as
   peculiarly expressive of any person, but oudiodos, comprehending the
   whole Deity; which undividedly is the prime object of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. But in this
   particular it is the testimony and authority of the Father (as such)
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, of which we speak, and whereupon faith is distinctly fixed on
   him; -- which, if it were not so, the Son could not add, "Believe also
   in me."
				</p><p>
   The like also is said of love. <reference osisRef="1John.2.15">1 John 2:15</reference>, "If any man love the
   world, the love of the Father is not in him;" that is, the love which
   we bear to him, not that which we receive from him. The Father is here
   placed as the object of our love, in opposition to the world, which
   takes up our affections he agape tou Patros. The Father denotes the
   matter and object, not the efficient cause, of the love inquired after.
   And this love of him as a Father is that which he calls his "honour,"
   <reference osisRef="Mal.1.6">Malachi 1:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   Farther: these graces as acted in prayer and praises, and as clothed
   with instituted worship, are peculiarly directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. "Ye call on
   the Father," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.17">1 Peter 1:17</reference> <reference osisRef="Eph.3.14-Eph.3.15">Ephesians 3:14-15</reference>, "For this cause I bow my
   knees to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
   family in heaven and earth is named." Bowing the knee comprises<note n="compriseth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   whole worship of God, both that which is moral, in the universal
   obedience he requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>, and those peculiar ways of carrying it on which
   are by him appointed, <reference osisRef="Isa.45.23">Isaiah 45:23</reference>, "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord, "every
   knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear." Which, verses 24, 25, he
   declares<note n="declareth">Auto-modernized</note> to consist in their acknowledging of him for righteousness
   and strength. Yea, it seems sometimes to comprehend the orderly
   subjection of the whole creation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his sovereignty. [21] In this
   place of the apostle it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a far more restrained acceptation, and is
   but a figurative expression of prayer, taken from the most expressive
   bodily posture to be used in that duty. This he farther manifests, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.16-Eph.3.17">Ephesians 3:16-17</reference>, declaring at large what his aim was, and whereabout his
   thoughts were exercised, in that bowing of his knees. The workings,
   then, of the Spirit of grace in that duty are distinctly directed to
   the Father as such, as the fountain of the Deity, and of all good
   things in Christ, -- as the "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." And
   therefore the same apostle does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, in another place, expressly conjoin,
   and yet as expressly distinguish, the Father and the Son in directing
   his supplications, <reference osisRef="1Thess.3.11">1 Thessalonians 3:11</reference>, "God himself even our Father, and
   our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you." The like precedent,
   also, have you of thanksgiving, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3-Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:3-4</reference>, "Blessed be the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," etc. I shall not add those very many
   places in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the several particulars [22] that do concur to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that
   whole divine worship (not to be communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any, by nature not
   God, without idolatry) in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the saints do hold communion with God,
   are distinctly directed to the person of the Father.
				</p><p>
   2. It is so also in reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son. <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>, "Ye believe in
   God," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, "believe also in me;" -- "Believe also, act faith
   distinctly on me; faith divine, supernatural, -- that faith through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> you
   believe in God, that is, the Father. There is a believing of Christ,
   namely, that he is the Son of God, the Saviour of the world. That is
   that whose neglect our Saviour so threatened to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Pharisees, <reference osisRef="John.8.24">John 8:24</reference>, "If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins."
   In this sense faith is not immediately fixed on the Son, being only an
   owning of him (that is, the Christ to be the Son), by closing with the
   testimony of the Father concerning him. But there is also a believing
   on him, called "Believing on the name of the Son of God," <reference osisRef="1John.5.13">1 John 5:13</reference>;
   so also <reference osisRef="John.9.36">John 9:36</reference>; -- yea, the distinct affixing of faith, affiance,
   and confidence on the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, as the Son of
   God, is most frequently pressed. <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference>, "God" (that is, the
   Father) "so loved the world, ... that whosoever believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> in him" (that
   is, the Son) "should not perish." The Son, who is given of the Father,
   is believed on. "He that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> on him is not condemned," verse 18.
   "He that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> on the Son has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> everlasting life," verse 36. "This
   is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent," <reference osisRef="John.6.29 John.6.40">John 6:29, 40</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.5.10">1 John 5:10</reference> The foundation of the whole is laid, <reference osisRef="John.5.23">John 5:23</reference>,
   "That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He
   that honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Son honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Father which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent
   him." But of this honour and worship of the Son I have treated at large
   elsewhere; [23] and shall not in general insist upon it again. For
   love, I shall only add that solemn apostolical benediction, <reference osisRef="Eph.6.24">Ephesians 6:24</reference>, "Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
   sincerity," -- that is, with divine love, the love of religious
   worship; which is the only incorrupt love of the Lord Jesus.
				</p><p>
   Farther: that faith, hope, and love, acting themselves in all manner of
   obedience and appointed worship, are peculiarly due from the saints,
   [24] and distinctly directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, is abundantly manifest from
   that solemn doxology, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5-Rev.1.6">Revelation of John 1:5-6</reference>, "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that loved us, and washed
   us from our sins in his own blood, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made us kings and priests
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and
   ever. Amen." Which yet is set forth with more glory, chap. v. 8, "The
   four living creatures, and the four and twenty elders fell down before
   the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of
   odours, which are the prayers of saints:" and verses 13, 14, "Every
   creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and
   such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
   blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note>
   upon the throne, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb for ever and ever." The Father and
   the Son (he that sits upon the throne, and the Lamb) are held out
   jointly, yet distinctly, as the adequate object of all divine worship
   and honour, for ever and ever. And therefore Stephen, in his solemn
   dying invocation, fixes<note n="fixeth">Auto-modernized</note> his faith and hope distinctly on him, <reference osisRef="Acts.7.59-Acts.7.60">Acts 7:59-60</reference>, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit;" and, "Lord, lay not this
   sin to their charge;" -- for he knew that the Son of man had power to
   forgive sins also. And this worship of the Lord Jesus, the apostle
   makes the discriminating character of the saints, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.2">1 Corinthians 1:2</reference>, "With
   all," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ
   our Lord, both theirs and ours;" that is, with all the saints of God.
   And invocation generally comprises the whole worship of God. [25] This,
   then, is the due of our Mediator, though as God, as the Son, -- not as
   Mediator.
				</p><p>
   3. Thus also is it in reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Spirit of grace. The
   closing of the great sin of unbelief [26] is still described as an
   opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and a resisting of that Holy Spirit. And you have
   distinct mention of the love of the Spirit, <reference osisRef="Rom.15.30">Romans 15:30</reference> The apostle
   also peculiarly directs his supplication to him in that solemn
   benediction, <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.14">2 Corinthians 13:14</reference>, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all."
   And such benedictions are originally supplications. He is likewise
   entitled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all instituted worship, from the appointment of the
   administration of baptism in his name, <reference osisRef="Matt.28.19">Matthew 28:19</reference> Of which
   things more afterward.
				</p><p>
   Now, of the things which have been delivered this is the sum:  there
   is no grace through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> our souls go forth to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, no act of divine
   worship yielded to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, duty or obedience performed, but they are
   distinctly directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Father, Son, and Spirit. Now, by these and
   such like ways as these, do we hold communion with God; and therefore
   we have that communion distinctly, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been described.
				</p><p>
   This also may farther appear, if we consider how distinctly the persons
   of the Deity are revealed to act in the communication of those good
   things, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the saints have communion with God. [27] As all the
   spiritual ascendings of their souls are assigned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them
   respectively, so all their internal receiving of the communications of
   God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them are held out in such a distribution as points at distinct
   rises and fountains (though not of being in themselves, yet) of
   dispensations to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. Now this is declared two ways: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) When the same thing is, at the same time, ascribed jointly and yet
   distinctly to all the persons in the Deity, and respectively to each of
   them. So are grace and peace, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.4-Rev.1.5">Revelation of John 1:4-5</reference>, "Grace be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, and
   peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from
   the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ,
   who is the faithful witness," etc. The seven Spirits before the throne,
   are the Holy Spirit of God, considered as the perfect fountain of every
   perfect gift and dispensation. All are here joined together, and yet
   all mentioned as distinguished in their communication of grace and
   peace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints. "Grace and peace be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, from the Father,
   and from," etc.
				</p><p>
   (2.) When the same thing is attributed severally and singly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> each
   person. There is, indeed, no gracious influence from above, no illapse
   of light, life, love, or grace upon our hearts, but proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> in such
   a dispensation. I shall give only one instance, which is very
   comprehensive, and may be thought to comprise all other particulars;
   and this is teaching. The teaching of God is the real communication of
   all and every particular emanation from himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   they are made partakers. That promise, "They shall be all taught of
   God," inwraps in itself the whole mystery of grace, as to its actual
   dispensation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, so far as we may be made real possessors of it.
   Now this is assigned, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father. The accomplishment of that promise is peculiarly
   referred to him, <reference osisRef="John.6.45">John 6:45</reference>, "It is written in the prophets, And they
   shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> heard, and
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> learned of the Father, comes to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me." This teaching, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we
   are translated from death to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> life, brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a
   participation of life and love in him, -- it is of and from the Father:
   him we hear, of him we learn, [28] by him are we brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> union and
   communion with the Lord Jesus. This is his drawing us, his begetting us
   anew of his own will, by his Spirit; and in which work he employs the
   ministers of the gospel, <reference osisRef="Acts.26.17-Acts.26.18">Acts 26:17-18</reference>
				</p><p>
   [2.] To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son. The Father proclaims him from heaven to be the great
   teacher, in that solemn charge to hear him, which came once [and] again
   from the excellent glory: "This is my beloved Son; hear him." The whole
   of his prophetical, and no small part of his kingly office, consists in
   this teaching; in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is he said to draw men to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, as the Father is
   said to do in his teaching, <reference osisRef="John.12.32">John 12:32</reference>; which he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> with such
   efficacy, that "the dead hear his voice and live." [29] The teaching of
   the Son is a life-giving, a spirit-breathing teaching; -- an effectual
   influence of light, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he shines into darkness; a communication of
   life, quickening the dead; an opening of blind eyes, and changing of
   hard hearts; a pouring out of the Spirit, with all the fruits of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
   Hence he claims it as his privilege to be the sole master, <reference osisRef="Matt.23.10">Matthew 23:10</reference>, "One is your Master, even Christ."
				</p><p>
   [3.] To the Spirit. <reference osisRef="John.14.26">John 14:26</reference>, "The Comforter, he shall teach you
   all things." "But the anointing which ye have received," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the
   apostle, "abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note> in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but
   as the same anointing teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> you of all things, and is truth, and is
   no lie, and even as it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taught you, ye shall abide in him," <reference osisRef="1John.2.27">1 John 2:27</reference> That teaching unction which is not only true, but truth itself,
   is only the Holy Spirit of God: so that he teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> also; being given
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us "that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
   God," <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.12">1 Corinthians 2:12</reference> I have chosen this special instance because, as I
   told you, it is comprehensive, and comprises in itself most of the
   particulars that might be annumerated, -- quickening, preserving, etc.
				</p><p>
   This, then, farther drives on the truth that lies under demonstration;
   there being such a distinct communication of grace from the several
   persons of the Deity, the saints must needs have distinct communion
   with them.
				</p><p>
   It remains<note n="remaineth">Auto-modernized</note> only to intimate, in a word, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this distinction
   lies, and what is the ground of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Now, this is, that the Father
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it by the way of original authority; the Son by the way of
   communicating from a purchased treasury; the Holy Spirit by the way of
   immediate efficacy.
				</p><p>
   1st. The Father communicates all grace by the way of original
   authority: He quickens<note n="quickeneth">Auto-modernized</note> whom he will, <reference osisRef="John.5.21">John 5:21</reference> "Of his own will
   begat he us," <reference osisRef="Jas.1.18">James 1:18</reference> Life-giving power is, in respect of original
   authority, invested in the Father by the way of eminency; and
   therefore, in sending of the quickening Spirit, Christ is said to do it
   from the Father, or the Father himself to do it. "But the Comforter,
   which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send," <reference osisRef="John.14.26">John 14:26</reference> "But
   when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you from the Father,"
   <reference osisRef="John.15.26">John 15:26</reference>; -- though he be also said to send him himself, on another
   account, <reference osisRef="John.16.7">John 16:7</reference>
				</p><p>
   2dly. The Son, by the way of making out a purchased treasury: "Of his
   fulness have all we received, and grace for grace," <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference> And
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is this fulness? "It pleased the Father that in him should all
   fulness dwell," <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference> And upon what account he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the
   dispensation of that fulness to him committed you may see, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.8-Phil.2.11">Philippians 2:8-11</reference> "When you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall
   prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his
   hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
   by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall
   bear their iniquities," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.10-Isa.53.11">Isaiah 53:10-11</reference> And with this fulness he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> also authority for the communication of it, <reference osisRef="John.5.25-John.5.27">John 5:25-27</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.28.18">Matthew 28:18</reference>
				</p><p>
   3dly. The Spirit does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it by the way of immediate efficacy, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.11">Romans 8:11</reference>, "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
   in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
   mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in you." Here are all three
   comprised, with their distinct concurrence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our quickening. Here is
   the Father's authoritative quickening, -- "He raised Christ from the
   dead, and he shall quicken you;" and the Son's mediatory quickening, --
   for it is done in "the death of Christ;" and the Spirit's immediate
   efficacy, -- "He shall do it by the Spirit that dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in you." He
   that desires to see this whole matter farther explained, may consult
   what I have elsewhere written on this subject. And thus is the distinct
   communion of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we treat both proved and demonstrated.

<title>Part 1 Chapter 3</title>
<p>
   Of the peculiar and distinct communion which the saints have with the
   Father -- Observations for the clearing of the whole premised -- Our
   peculiar communion with the Father is in love -- <reference osisRef="1John.4.7-1John.4.8">1 John 4:7-8</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.14">2 Corinthians 13:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.16.26-John.16.27">John 16:26-27</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.5.5">Romans 5:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference>, xiv. 23; <reference osisRef="Titus.3.4">Titus 3:4</reference>, opened to this purpose -- What is required of believers to hold
   communion with the Father in love -- His love received by faith --
   Returns of love to him -- God's love to us and ours to him -- In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   they agree -- In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they differ.
				</p><p>
   Having proved that there is such a distinct communion in respect of
   Father, Son, and Spirit, as of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak, it remains that it be
   farther cleared up by an induction of instances, to manifest what [it
   is], and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the saints peculiarly hold this communion with the
   several persons respectively: which also I shall do, after the
   premising some observations, necessary to be previously considered, as
   was promised, for the clearing of what has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been spoken. And they are
   these that follow: 
				</p><p>
   1. When I assign any thing as peculiar in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we distinctly hold
   communion with any person, I do not exclude the other persons from
   communion with the soul in the very same thing. Only this, I say,
   principally, immediately, and by the way of eminency, we have, in such
   a thing, or in such a way, communion with some one person; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>
   with the others secondarily, and by the way of consequence on that
   foundation; for the person, as the person, of any one of them, is not
   the prime object of divine worship, but as it is identified with the
   nature or essence of God. Now, the works that outwardly are of God
   (called "Trinitatis ad extra"), [30] which are commonly said to be
   common and undivided, are either wholly so, and in all respects, as all
   works of common providence; or else, being common in respect of their
   acts, they are distinguished in respect of that principle, or next and
   immediate rise in the manner of operation: so creation is appropriated
   to the Father, redemption to the Son. In which sense we speak of these
   things.
				</p><p>
   2. There is a concurrence of the actings and operations of the whole
   Deity [31] in that dispensation, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> each person concurs to the
   work of our salvation, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every act of our communion with each
   singular person. Look, by what act soever we hold communion with any
   person, there is an influence from every person to the putting forth of
   that act. [32] As, suppose it to be the act of faith:  It is bestowed
   on us by the Father: "It is not of yourselves: it is the gift of God,"
   <reference osisRef="Eph.2.8">Ephesians 2:8</reference> It is the Father that reveals<note n="revealeth">Auto-modernized</note> the gospel, and Christ
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Matt.11.25">Matthew 11:25</reference> And it is purchased for us by the Son: "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you
   it is given in the behalf of Christ, to believe on him," <reference osisRef="Phil.1.29">Philippians 1:29</reference>
   In him are we "blessed with spiritual blessings," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3">Ephesians 1:3</reference> He bestows
   on us, and increases<note n="increaseth">Auto-modernized</note> faith in us, <reference osisRef="Luke.17.5">Luke 17:5</reference> And it is wrought in
   us by the Spirit; he administers that "exceeding greatness of his
   power," which he exercises<note n="exerciseth">Auto-modernized</note> towards them who believe, "according to the
   working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised
   him from the dead," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.19-Eph.1.20">Ephesians 1:19-20</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.8.11">Romans 8:11</reference>
				</p><p>
   3. When I assign any particular thing in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we hold communion with
   any person, I do not do it exclusively to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> other mediums of communion;
   but only by the way of inducing a special and eminent instance for the
   proof and manifestation of the former general assertion: otherwise
   there is no grace or duty in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have not communion with God in the
   way described. In every thing in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we are made partakers of the
   divine nature, there is a communication and receiving between God and
   us; so near are we to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in Christ.
				</p><p>
   4. By asserting this distinct communion, which merely respects that
   order in the dispensation of grace which God is pleased to hold out in
   the gospel, I intend not in the least to shut up all communion with God
   under these precincts (his ways being exceeding broad, containing a
   perfection of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> there is no end), nor to prejudice that holy
   fellowship we have with the whole Deity, in our walking before him in
   covenant-obedience; which also, God assisting, I shall handle
   hereafter.
				</p><p>
   These few observations being premised, I come now to declare what it is
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> peculiarly and eminently the saints have communion with the
   Father; and this is love, -- free, undeserved, and eternal love. This
   the Father peculiarly fixes upon the saints; this they are immediately
   to eye in him, to receive of him, and to make such returns of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> as
   he is delighted withal. This is the great discovery of the gospel: for
   whereas the Father, as the fountain of the Deity, is not known any
   other way but as full of wrath, anger, and indignation against sin, nor
   can the sons of men have any other thoughts of him (<reference osisRef="Rom.1.18">Romans 1:18</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.33.13-Isa.33.14">Isaiah 33:13-14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Hab.1.13">Habakkuk 1:13</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.5.4-Ps.5.6">Psalms 5:4-6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.2.3">Ephesians 2:3</reference>), -- here he is now
   revealed peculiarly as love, as full of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; the manifestation
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is the peculiar work of the gospel, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.4">Titus 3:4</reference>
				</p><p>
   1. <reference osisRef="1John.4.8">1 John 4:8</reference>, "God is love." That the name of God is here taken
   personally, [33] and for the person of the Father, not essentially, is
   evident from verse 9, where he is distinguished from his only begotten
   Son whom he sends into the world. Now, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "The Father is love;"
   that is, not only of an infinitely gracious, tender, compassionate, and
   loving nature, according as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> proclaimed himself, <reference osisRef="Exod.34.6-Exod.34.7">Exodus 34:6-7</reference>, but also one that "eminently and peculiarly dispenses<note n="dispenseth">Auto-modernized</note> himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us in free love." So the apostle sets it forth in the following verses:
   "This is love," verse 9; -- "This is that which I would have you take
   notice of in him, that he makes out love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, in sending his only
   begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.'?" So
   also, verse 10, "He loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation
   for our sins." And that this is peculiarly to be eyed in him, the Holy
   Ghost plainly declares, in making it antecedent to the sending of
   Christ, and all mercies and benefits whatever by him received. This
   love, I say, in itself, is antecedent to the purchase of Christ,
   although the whole fruit of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> be made out alone thereby, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4-Eph.1.6">Ephesians 1:4-6</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. So in that distribution made by the apostle in his solemn parting
   benediction, <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.14">2 Corinthians 13:14</reference>, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the
   love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with you all."
   Ascribing sundry things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the distinct persons, it is love that he
   peculiarly assigns to the Father. And the fellowship of the Spirit is
   mentioned with the grace of Christ and the love of God, because it is
   by the Spirit alone that we have fellowship with Christ in grace, and
   with the Father in love, although we have also peculiar fellowship with
   him; as shall be declared.
				</p><p>
   3. <reference osisRef="John.16.26-John.16.27">John 16:26-27</reference>, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> our Saviour, "I say not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, that I
   will pray the Father for you; for the Father himself loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> you." [34]
   But how is this, that our Saviour says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "I say not that I will pray
   the Father for you," when he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> plainly, chap. xiv. 16, "I will pray
   the Father for you?" The disciples, with all the gracious words,
   comfortable and faithful promises of their Master, with most heavenly
   discoveries of his heart to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, were even fully convinced of his
   dear and tender affections towards them; as also of his continued care
   and kindness, that he would not forget them when bodily he was gone
   from them, as he was now upon his departure: but now all their thoughts
   are concerning the Father, how they should be accepted with him, what
   respect he had towards them. Says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> our Saviour, "Take no care of that,
   nay, impose not that upon me, of procuring the Father's love for you;
   but know that this is his peculiar respect towards you, and which you
   are in him: He himself loves you.' It is true, indeed (and as I told
   you), that I will pray the Father to send you the Spirit, the
   Comforter, and with him all the gracious fruits of his love; but yet in
   the point of love itself, free love, eternal love, there is no need of
   any intercession for that: for eminently the Father himself loves you.
   Resolve of that, that you may hold communion with him in it, and be no
   more troubled about it. Yea, as your great trouble is about the
   Father's love, so you can no way more trouble or burden him, than by
   your unkindness in not believing of it." So it must needs be where
   sincere love is questioned.
				</p><p>
   4. The apostle teaches the same, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.5">Romans 5:5</reference>, "The love of God is shed
   abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us." God,
   whose love this is, is plainly distinguished from the Holy Ghost, who
   sheds abroad that love of his; and, verse 8, he is also distinguished
   from the Son, for it is from that love of his that the Son is sent: and
   therefore it is the Father of whom the apostle here specially speaks<note n="speaketh">Auto-modernized</note>.
   And what is it that he ascribes to him? Even love; which also, verse 8,
   he commends<note n="commendeth">Auto-modernized</note> to us, -- sets it forth in such a signal and eminent
   expression, that we may take notice of it, and close with him in it. To
   carry this business to its height, there is not only most frequent
   peculiar mention of the love of God, where the Father is eminently
   intended, and of the love of the Father expressly, but he is also
   called "The God of love," <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.11">2 Corinthians 13:11</reference>, and is said to be "love:" so
   that whoever will know him, <reference osisRef="1John.4.8">1 John 4:8</reference>, or dwell in him by fellowship
   or communion, verse 16, must do it as he is love."
				</p><p>
   5. Nay, whereas there is a twofold divine love, beneplaciti and
   amicitiae, a love of good pleasure and destination, and a love of
   friendship and approbation, they are both peculiarly assigned to the
   Father in an eminent manner: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference>, "God so loved the world, that he gave," etc.; that
   is, with the love of his purpose and good pleasure, his determinate
   will of doing good. This is distinctly ascribed to him, being laid down
   as the cause of sending his Son. So <reference osisRef="Rom.9.11-Rom.9.12">Romans 9:11-12</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4-Eph.1.5">Ephesians 1:4-5</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Thess.2.13-2Thess.2.14">2 Thessalonians 2:13-14</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.4.8-1John.4.9">1 John 4:8-9</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) <reference osisRef="John.14.23">John 14:23</reference>, there is [35] mention of that other kind of love
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak. "If a man love me," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, "he will keep my
   words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and make
   our abode with him." The love of friendship and approbation is here
   eminently ascribed to him. Says Christ, "We will come," even Father and
   Son, "to such a one, and dwell with him;" that is, by the Spirit: but
   yet he would have us take notice, that, in point of love, the Father
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a peculiar prerogative: "My Father will love him."
				</p><p>
   6. Yea, and as this love is peculiarly to be eyed in him, so it is to
   be looked on as the fountain of all following gracious dispensations.
   Christians walk oftentimes with exceedingly troubled hearts, concerning
   the thoughts of the Father towards them. They are well persuaded of the
   Lord Christ and his good-will; the difficulty lies in what is their
   acceptance with the Father, -- what is his heart towards them? [36]
   "Show us the Father, and it suffices<note n="sufficeth">Auto-modernized</note> us," <reference osisRef="John.14.8">John 14:8</reference> Now, this ought
   to be so far away, that his love ought to be looked on as the fountain
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> all other sweetnesses flow. Thus the apostle sets it out,
   <reference osisRef="Titus.3.4">Titus 3:4</reference>, "After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour
   toward man appeared." It is of the Father of whom he speaks; for, verse
   6, he tells us that "he makes out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us," or "sheds that love upon us
   abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour." And this love he makes
   the hinge upon which the great alteration and translation of the saints
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> turn; for, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, verse 3, "We ourselves also were sometimes
   foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
   living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another." All
   naught, all out of order, and vile. From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>, then, is our recovery? The
   whole rise of it is from this love of God, flowing out by the ways
   there described. For when the kindness and love of God appeared, --
   that is, in the fruits of it, -- then did this alteration ensue. To
   secure us of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, there is not any thing that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a loving and tender
   nature in the world, and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> act suitably to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   not compared himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Separate all weakness and imperfection which
   is in them, yet great impressions of love must abide. He is as a
   father, a mother, a shepherd, a hen over chickens, and the like, <reference osisRef="Ps.103.13">Psalms 103:13</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.63.16">Isaiah 63:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.6.6">Matthew 6:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.66.13">Isaiah 66:13</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.23.1">Psalms 23:1</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="Isa.40.11">Isaiah 40:11</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.23.37">Matthew 23:37</reference>
				</p><p>
   I shall not need to add any more proofs. This is that which is
   demonstrated:  There is love in the person of the Father peculiarly
   held out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints, as in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he will and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> hold communion
   with them.
				</p><p>
   Now, to complete communion with the Father in love, two things are
   required of believers:  (1.) That they receive it of him. (2.) That
   they make suitable returns to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   (1.) That they do receive it. Communion consists in giving and
   receiving. Until the love of the Father be received, we have no
   communion with him in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. How, then, is this love of the Father to be
   received, so as to hold fellowship with him? I answer, By faith. The
   receiving of it is the believing of it. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> so fully, so eminently
   revealed his love, that it may be received by faith. "Ye believe in
   God," <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>; that is, the Father. And what is to be believe in
   him? His love; for he is "love," <reference osisRef="1John.4.8">1 John 4:8</reference>
				</p><p>
   It is true, there is not an immediate acting of faith upon the Father,
   but by the Son. "He is the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note>
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father but by him," <reference osisRef="John.14.6">John 14:6</reference> He is the merciful high
   priest over the house of God, by whom we have [37] access to the throne
   of grace: by him is our manuduction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father; by him we believe
   in God, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.21">1 Peter 1:21</reference> But this is that I say, -- When by and through
   Christ we have an access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father, we then behold his glory
   also, and see his love that he peculiarly bears to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and act faith
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. We are then, I say, to eye it, to believe it, to receive it,
   as in him; the issues and fruits of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> being made out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us through
   Christ alone. Though there be no light for us but in the beams, yet we
   may by beams see the sun, which is the fountain of it. Though all our
   refreshment actually lie in the streams, yet by them we are led up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the fountain. Jesus Christ, in respect of the love of the Father, is
   but the beam, the stream; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> though actually all our light, our
   refreshment lies, yet by him we are led to the fountain, the sun of
   eternal love itself. Would believers exercise themselves in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, they
   would find it a matter of no small spiritual improvement in their
   walking with God.
				</p><p>
   This is that which is aimed at. Many dark and disturbing thoughts are
   apt to arise in this thing. Few can carry up their hearts and minds to
   this height by faith, as to rest their souls in the love of the Father;
   they live below it, in the troublesome region of hopes and fears,
   storms and clouds. All here is serene and quiet. But how to attain to
   this pitch they know not. This is the will of God, that he may always
   be eyed as benign, kind, tender, loving, and unchangeable in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; and
   that peculiarly as the Father, as the great fountain and spring of all
   gracious communications and fruits of love. This is that which Christ
   came to reveal, -- God as a Father, <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference>; that name which he
   declares to those who are given him out of the world, <reference osisRef="John.17.6">John 17:6</reference> And
   this is that which he effectually leads us to by himself, as he is the
   only way of going to God as a Father, <reference osisRef="John.14.5-John.14.6">John 14:5-6</reference>; that is, as love:
   and by doing so, gives us the rest which he promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note>; for the love of
   the Father is the only rest of the soul. It is true, as was said, we do
   not this formally in the first instant of believing. We believe in God
   through Christ, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.21">1 Peter 1:21</reference>; faith seeks out rest for the soul. This
   is presented to it by Christ, the mediator, as the only procuring
   cause. Here it abides not, but by Christ it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> an access to the
   Father, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference>, -- into his love; finds out that he is love, as
   having a design, a purpose of love, a good pleasure towards us from
   eternity, -- a delight, a complacency, a good-will in Christ, -- all
   cause of anger and aversation being taken away. The soul being thus, by
   faith through Christ, and by him, brought into the bosom of God, into a
   comfortable persuasion and spiritual perception and sense of his love,
   there reposes and rests itself. And this is the first thing the saints
   do, in their communion with the Father; of the due improvement of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>,
   more afterward.
				</p><p>
   (2.) For that suitable return which is required, this also (in a main
   part of it, beyond which I shall not now extend it) consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in love.
   [38] God loves, that he may be beloved. [39] When he comes to command
   the return of his received love, to complete communion with him, he
   says, "My son, give me your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> heart," <reference osisRef="Prov.23.26">Proverbs 23:26</reference>, -- your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   affections, your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> love. "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt love the Lord your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> God with all your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   heart, and with all your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> soul, and with all your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> strength, and with all
   your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> mind," <reference osisRef="Luke.10.27">Luke 10:27</reference>; this is the return that he demands<note n="demandeth">Auto-modernized</note>. When the
   soul sees God, in his dispensation of love, to be love, to be
   infinitely lovely and loving, rests upon and delights in him as such,
   then has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it communion with him in love. This is love, that God loves
   us first, and then we love him again. I shall not now go forth into a
   description of divine love. Generally, love [40] is an affection of
   union and nearness, with complacency in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. So long as the Father is
   looked on under any other apprehension, but only as acting love upon
   the soul, it breeds in the soul a dread and aversation. [41] Hence the
   flying and hiding of sinners, in the Scriptures. But when he who is the
   Father is considered as a father, acting love on the soul, this [42]
   raises it to love again. This is, in faith, the ground of all
   acceptable obedience, <reference osisRef="Deut.5.10">Deuteronomy 5:10</reference>; <reference osisRef="Exod.20.6">Exodus 20:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Deut.10.12">Deuteronomy 10:12</reference>, xi. 1, 13,
   xiii. 3.
				</p><p>
   Thus is this whole business stated by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</reference>,
   "According as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> chosen us in him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." It
   begins in the love of God, and ends in our love to him. That is it
   which the eternal love of God aims at in us, and works us up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. It
   is true, our universal obedience falls within the compass of our
   communion with God; but that is with him as God, our blessed sovereign,
   lawgiver, and rewarder: as he is the Father, our Father in Christ, as
   revealed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us to be love, above and contrary to all the expectations
   of the natural man; so it is in love that we have this intercourse with
   him. Nor do I intend only that love which is as the life and form of
   all moral obedience; but a peculiar delight and acquiescing in the
   Father, revealed effectually as love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the soul.
				</p><p>
   That this communion with the Father in love may be made the more clear
   and evident, I shall show two things:  [1.] In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this love of God
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us and our love to him do agree, as to some manner of analogy and
   likeness. [2.] In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they differ; [43] which will farther discover
   the nature of each of them.
				</p><p>
   [1.] They agree in two things: 
				</p><p>
   1st. That they are each a love of rest and complacency.
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The love of God is so. <reference osisRef="Zeph.3.17">Zephaniah 3:17</reference>, "The Lord your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> God in the
   midst of you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> with
   joy, he will rest in his love; he will joy over you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> with singing."
   Both these things are here assigned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in his love, -- [44] rest
   and delight. The words are, ychrys b'hvtv, -- "He shall be silent
   because of his love." To rest with contentment is expressed by being
   silent; that is, without repining, without complaint. This God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   upon the account of his own love, so full, so every way complete and
   absolute, that it will not allow him to complain of any thing in them
   whom he loves, but he is silent on the account of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Or, "Rest in
   his love;" that is, he will not remove it, -- he will not seek farther
   for another object. It shall make its abode upon the soul where it is
   once fixed, for ever. And complacency or delight: "He rejoices<note n="rejoiceth">Auto-modernized</note> with
   singing;" as one that is fully satisfied in that object he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> fixed
   his love on. Here are two words used to express the delight and joy
   that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in his love, -- ysys and ygyl. The first denotes the
   inward affection of the mind, joy of heart; and to set out the
   intenseness of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, it is said he shall do it bsmchh, -- in gladness,
   or with joy. To have joy of heart in gladness, is the highest
   expression of delight in love. The latter word denotes not the inward
   affection, but the outward [45] demonstration of it: agallian seems to
   be formed of it. It is to exult in outward demonstration of internal
   delight and joy; -- "Tripudiare," to leap, as men overcome with some
   joyful surprisal. And therefore God is said to do this brnh, -- with a
   joyful sound, or singing. To rejoice with gladness of heart, to exult
   with singing and praise, argues the greatest delight and complacency
   possible. When he would express the contrary of this love, he says ouk
   eudokese, -- "he was not well pleased," <reference osisRef="1Cor.10.5">1 Corinthians 10:5</reference>; he fixed not his
   delight nor rest on them. And, "If any man draw back, the Lord's soul
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no pleasure in him," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.38">Hebrews 10:38</reference>; <reference osisRef="Jer.22.28">Jeremiah 22:28</reference>; <reference osisRef="Hos.8.8">Hosea 8:8</reference>; <reference osisRef="Mal.1.10">Malachi 1:10</reference> He takes pleasure in those that abide with him. He sings to his
   church, "A vineyard of red wine: I the Lord do keep it," <reference osisRef="Isa.27.2-Isa.27.3">Isaiah 27:2-3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.147.11">Psalms 147:11</reference>, cxlix. 4. There is rest and complacency in his love.
   There is in the Hebrew but a metathesis of a letter between the word
   that signifies a love of will and desire ('hv is so to love), and that
   which denotes a love of rest and acquiescence (which is, 'vh); and both
   are applied to God. He wills good to us, that he may rest in that will.
   Some say, agapan, "to love," is from agan pothesthai, perfectly to
   acquiesce in the thing loved. And when God calls his Son agapeton,
   "beloved," <reference osisRef="Matt.3.17">Matthew 3:17</reference>, he adds, as an exposition of it, en ho
   eudokesa, "in whom I rest well pleased."
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) The return that the saints make to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, to complete communion
   with him in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, holds some analogy with his love in this; for it is a
   love also of [46] rest and delight. "Return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> rest, my soul,"
   says David, <reference osisRef="Ps.116.7">Psalms 116:7</reference> He makes God his rest; that is, he in whom his
   soul does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> rest, without seeking farther for a more suitable and
   desirable object. "Whom have I," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "in heaven but you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> and
   there is none upon earth that I desire beside you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Ps.73.25">Psalms 73:25</reference>
   [47] Thus the soul gathers itself from all its wanderings, from all
   other beloveds, to rest in God alone, -- to satiate and content itself
   in him; choosing the Father for his present and eternal rest. And this
   also with delight. "Your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> loving-kindness," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the psalmist, "is
   better than life; therefore will I praise you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Ps.63.3">Psalms 63:3</reference> "Than
   life," mchyym, -- before lives. I will not deny but life in a single
   consideration sometimes is so expressed, but always emphatically; so
   that the whole life, with all the concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of it, which may render
   it considerable, are thereby intended. Austin, on this place, reading
   it [48] "super vitas," extends it to the several courses of life that
   men engage themselves in. Life, in the whole continuance of it, with
   all its advantages whatever, is at least intended. Supposing himself in
   the jaws of death, rolling into the grave through innumerable troubles,
   yet he found more sweetness in God than in a long life, under its best
   and most noble considerations, attended with all enjoyments that make
   it pleasant and comfortable. From both these is that of the church, in
   <reference osisRef="Hos.14.3">Hosea 14:3</reference>, "Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses:
   neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods:
   for in you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> the fatherless finds<note n="findeth">Auto-modernized</note> mercy." They reject the most goodly
   appearances of rest and contentment, to make up all in God, on whom
   they cast themselves, as otherwise helpless orphans.
				</p><p>
   2dly. The mutual love of God and the saints agrees in this, -- that the
   way of communicating the issues and fruits of these loves is only in
   Christ. The Father communicates no issue of his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us but
   through Christ; and we make no return of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him but through
   Christ. He is the treasury in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the Father disposes<note n="disposeth">Auto-modernized</note> all the riches
   of his grace, taken from the bottomless mine of his eternal love; and
   he is the priest into whose hand we put all the offerings that we
   return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father. Thence he is first, and by way of eminency,
   said to love the Son; not only as his eternal Son, -- as he was the
   delight of his soul before the foundation of the world, <reference osisRef="Prov.8.30">Proverbs 8:30</reference>,
   -- but also as our mediator, and the means of conveying his love to us,
   <reference osisRef="Matt.3.17">Matthew 3:17</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.3.35">John 3:35</reference>, v. 20, x. 17, xv. 9, xvii. 24. And we are
   said through him to believe in and to have access to God.
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The Father loves us, and "chose us before the foundation of the
   world;" but in the pursuit of that love, he "blesses<note n="blesseth">Auto-modernized</note> us with all
   spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3-Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:3-4</reference> From
   his love, he sheds or pours out the Holy Spirit richly upon us, through
   Jesus Christ our Saviour, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.6">Titus 3:6</reference> In the pouring out of his love,
   there is not one drop falls besides the Lord Christ. The holy anointing
   oil was all poured on the head of Aaron, <reference osisRef="Ps.133.2">Psalms 133:2</reference>; and thence
   went down to the skirts of his clothing. Love is first poured out on
   Christ; and from him it drops as the dew of Hermon upon the souls of
   his saints. The Father will have him to have "in all things the
   pre-eminence," <reference osisRef="Col.1.18">Colossians 1:18</reference>; "it pleased him that in him all fulness
   should dwell," verse 19; that "of his fulness we might receive, and
   grace for grace," <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference> Though the love of the Father's purpose
   and good pleasure have its rise and foundation in his mere grace and
   will, yet the design of its accomplishment is only in Christ. All the
   fruits of it are first given to him; and it is in him only that they
   are dispensed to us. So that though the saints may, nay, do, see an
   infinite ocean of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them in the bosom of the Father, yet they
   are not to look for one drop from him but what comes through Christ. He
   is the only means of communication. Love in the Father is like honey in
   the flower; -- it must be in the comb before it be for our use. Christ
   must extract and prepare this honey for us. He draws this water from
   the fountain through union and dispensation of fulness; -- we by faith,
   from the wells of salvation that are in him. This was in part before
   discovered.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) Our returns are all in him, and by him also. And well is it
   with us that it is so. What lame and blind sacrifices should we
   otherwise present to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God! He [49] bears the iniquity of our
   offerings, and he adds incense to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our prayers. Our love is fixed on
   the Father; but it is conveyed to him through the Son of his love. He
   is the only way for our graces as well as our persons to go to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God;
   through him passes<note n="passeth">Auto-modernized</note> all our desire, our delight, our complacency, our
   obedience. Of which more afterward.
				</p><p>
   Now, in these two things there is some resemblance between that mutual
   love of the Father and the saints in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they hold communion.
				</p><p>
   [2.] There are sundry things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they differ: 
				</p><p>
   1st. The love of God is a love of bounty; our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him is a love
   of duty.
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The love of the Father is a love of bounty, -- a descending
   love; such a love as carries him out to do good things to us, great
   things for us. His love lies at the bottom of all dispensations towards
   us; and we scarce anywhere find any mention of it, but it is held out
   as the cause and fountain of some free gift flowing from it. He [50]
   loves us, and sends his Son to die for us; -- he loves us, and blesses<note n="blesseth">Auto-modernized</note>
   us with all spiritual blessings. Loving is choosing, <reference osisRef="Rom.9.11-Rom.9.12">Romans 9:11-12</reference>
   He loves us and chastises<note n="chastiseth">Auto-modernized</note> us. [It is] a [51] love like that of the
   heavens to the earth, when, being full of rain, they pour forth showers
   to make it fruitful; as the sea communicates its waters to the rivers
   by the way of bounty, out of its own fulness, -- they return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it
   only what they receive from it. It is the love of a spring, of a
   fountain, -- always communicating; -- [52] a love from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> proceeds
   every thing that is lovely in its object. It infuses<note n="infuseth">Auto-modernized</note> into, and creates
   goodness in, the persons beloved. And this answers the description of
   love given by the philosopher. "To love," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "esti boulesthai
   tini ha oietai agatha kai kata duamin praktikon eiai touon." He that
   loves works out good to them he loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>, as he is able. God's power and
   will are commensurate; -- what he wills<note n="willeth">Auto-modernized</note> he works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) Our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God is a love of duty, the love of a child. His
   love descends upon us in bounty and fruitfulness; [53] our love ascends
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in duty and thankfulness. He adds to us by his love; we
   nothing to him by ours. Our goodness extends not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Though our
   love be fixed on him [54] immediately, yet no fruit of our love
   reaches<note n="reacheth">Auto-modernized</note> him immediately; though he requires our love, he is not
   benefited by it, <reference osisRef="Job.35.5-Job.35.8">Job 35:5-8</reference>, <reference osisRef="Rom.11.35">Romans 11:35</reference>, <reference osisRef="Job.22.2-Job.22.3">Job 22:2-3</reference> It is
   indeed made up of these four things:  1. Rest; 2. Delight; 3.
   Reverence; 4. Obedience. By these do we hold communion with the Father
   in his love. Hence God calls that love which is due to him as a father,
   "honour," <reference osisRef="Mal.1.6">Malachi 1:6</reference>, "If I be a father, where is mine honour?" It is a
   deserved act of duty.
				</p><p>
   2dly. They differ in this:  The love of the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us is an
   antecedent love; our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him is a consequent love.
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The love of the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us is an antecedent love, and that
   in two respects: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] It is antecedent in respect of our love, <reference osisRef="1John.4.10">1 John 4:10</reference>, "In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us." His love goes
   before ours. The father loves the child, when the child knows not the
   father, much less loves him. Yea, we are by nature theostugeis, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.30">Romans 1:30</reference>, -- haters of God. He is in his own nature philanthropos, -- a lover
   of men; and surely all mutual love between him and us must begin on his
   hand.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] In respect of all other causes of love whatever. It goes not
   only before our love, but also any thing in us that is lovely. [55]
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.8">Romans 5:8</reference>, "God commends<note n="commendeth">Auto-modernized</note> his love towards us, in that while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> we were
   yet sinners Christ died for us." Not only his love, but the eminent
   fruit of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, is made out towards us as sinners. Sin holds out all of
   unloveliness and undesirableness that can be in a creature. The very
   mention of that removes all causes, all moving occasions of love
   whatever. Yet, as such, have we the commendation of the Father's love
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, by a most signal testimony. Not only when we have done no
   good, but when we are in our blood, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he love us; -- not because we
   are better than others, but because himself is infinitely good. His
   kindness appears when we are foolish and disobedient. Hence he is said
   to "love the world;" that is, those who have nothing but what is in and
   of the world, whose whole [portion] lies in evil.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) Our love is consequential in both these regards: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] In respect of the love of God. Never did creature turn his
   affections towards God, if the heart of God were not first set upon
   him.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] In respect of sufficient causes of love. God must be revealed
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us as lovely and desirable, as a fit and suitable object to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   soul to set up its rest upon, before we can bear any love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. The
   saints (in this sense) do not love God for nothing, but for that
   excellency, loveliness, and desirableness that is in him. As the
   psalmist says, in one particular, <reference osisRef="Ps.116.1">Psalms 116:1</reference>, "I love the Lord,
   because!" so may we in general; we love the Lord, because! Or, as David
   in another case, "What have I now done? is there not a cause?" If any
   man inquire about our love to God, we may say, "What have we now done?
   is there not a cause?"
				</p><p>
   3dly. They differ in this also:  The love of God is like himself, --
   equal, constant, not capable of augmentation or diminution; our love is
   like ourselves, -- unequal, increasing, waning, growing, declining.
   His, like the sun, always the same in its light, though a cloud may
   sometimes interpose; ours, as the moon, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> its enlargements and
   straitenings.
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The love of the Father is equal, etc.; [56] whom he loves, he
   loves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end, and he loves them always alike. "The Strength of
   Israel is not a man, that he should repent." On whom he fixes his love,
   it is immutable; it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not grow to eternity, it is not diminished at
   any time. It is an eternal love, that had no beginning, that shall have
   no ending; that cannot be heightened by any act of ours, that cannot be
   lessened by any thing in us. I say, in itself it is thus; otherwise, in
   a twofold regard, it may admit of change: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] In respect of its fruits. It is, as I said, a fruitful love, a
   love of bounty. In reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those fruits, it may sometimes be
   greater, sometimes less; its communications are various. Who among the
   saints finds it not [so]? What life, what light, what strength,
   sometimes! and again, how dead, how dark, how weak! as God is pleased
   to let out or to restrain the fruits of his love. All the graces of the
   Spirit in us, all sanctified enjoyments whatever, are fruits of his
   love. How variously these are dispensed, how differently at sundry
   seasons to the same persons, experience will abundantly testify.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] In respect of its discoveries and manifestations. He "sheds
   abroad his love in our hearts by the Holy Ghost," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.5">Romans 5:5</reference>, -- gives
   us a sense of it, manifests it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. Now, this is [57] various and
   changeable, sometimes more, sometimes less; now he shines, anon hides
   his face, as it may be for our profit. Our Father will not always
   chide, lest we be cast down; he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not always smile, lest we be full
   and neglect him: but yet, still his love in itself is the same. When
   for a little moment he hides his face, yet he gathers us with
   everlasting kindness.
				</p><p>
   Objection. But you will say, "This comes nigh to that blasphemy, that
   God loves his people in their sinning as well as in their strictest
   obedience; and, if so, who will care to serve him more, or to walk with
   him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> well-pleasing?"
				</p><p>
   Answer. There are few truths of Christ which, from some or other, have
   not received like entertainment with this. Terms and appellations are
   at the will of every imposer; things are not at all varied by them. The
   love of God in itself is the eternal purpose and act of his will. This
   is no more changeable than God himself: if it were, no flesh could be
   saved; but it [58] changes<note n="changeth">Auto-modernized</note> not, and we are not consumed. What then?
   loves he his people in their sinning? Yes; his people, -- not their
   sinning. Alters [59] he not his love towards them? Not the purpose of
   his will, but the dispensations of his grace. He rebukes them, he
   chastens them, he hides his face from them, he smites them, he fills
   them with a sense of [his] indignation; but woe, woe would it be to us,
   should he change in his love, or take away his kindness from us! Those
   very things which seem to be demonstrations of the change of his
   affections towards his, do as clearly proceed from love as those which
   seem to be the most genuine issues of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. "But will not this
   encourage to sin?" He never tasted of the love of God that can
   seriously make this objection. The doctrine of grace may be turned into
   wantonness; the principle cannot. I shall not wrong the saints by
   giving another answer to this objection: Detestation of sin in any may
   well consist with the acceptation of their persons, and their
   designation to life eternal.
				</p><p>
   But now our love to God is ebbing and flowing, waning and increasing.
   We lose our first love, and we grow again in love; [60] -- scarce a day
   at a stand. What poor creatures are we! How unlike the Lord and his
   love! "Unstable as water, we cannot excel." Now it is, "Though all men
   forsake you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, I will not;" anon, "I know not the man." One day, "I
   shall never be moved, my hill is so strong;" the next, "All men are
   liars, I shall perish." When ever was the time, where ever was the
   place, that our love was one day equal towards God?
				</p><p>
   And thus, these agreements and discrepancies do farther describe that
   mutual love of the Father and the saints, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they hold communion.
   Other instances as to the person of the Father I shall not give, but
   endeavour to make some improvement of this in the next chapter.

<title>Part 1 Chapter 4</title>
<p>
   Inferences on the former doctrine concerning communion with the Father
   in love.
				</p><p>
   Having thus discovered the nature of that distinct communion which we
   have with the Father, it remains<note n="remaineth">Auto-modernized</note> that we give some exhortations to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it, directions in it, and take some observations from it: 
				</p><p>
   1. First, then, this is a duty in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is most evident that
   Christians are but little exercised, -- namely, in holding immediate
   communion with the Father in love. Unacquaintedness with our mercies,
   our privileges, is our sin as well as our trouble. We hearken not to
   the voice of the Spirit [61] which is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, "that we may know
   the things that are freely bestowed on us of God." This makes us go
   heavily, when we might rejoice; and to be weak, where we might be
   strong in the Lord. How few of the saints are experimentally acquainted
   with this privilege of holding immediate communion with the Father in
   love! With what anxious, doubtful thoughts do they look upon him! What
   fears, what questioning are there, of his good-will and kindness! At
   the best, many think there is no sweetness at all in him towards us,
   but what is purchased at the high price of the blood of Jesus. It is
   true, that alone is the way of communication; but the free fountain and
   spring of all is in the bosom of the Father. [62] "Eternal life was
   with the Father, and is manifested to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us." Let us, then, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) Eye the Father as love; look not on him as an always lowering
   father, but as one most [63] kind and tender. Let us look on him by
   faith, as one that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> had thoughts of kindness towards us from
   everlasting. It is misapprehension of God that makes any run from him,
   who have the least breathing wrought in them after him. "They that know
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> will put their trust in you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>." Men cannot abide with God in
   spiritual meditations. He loses<note n="loseth">Auto-modernized</note> soul's company by their want of this
   insight into his love. They fix their thoughts only on his terrible
   majesty, severity, and greatness; and so their spirits are not
   endeared. Would a soul continually eye his everlasting tenderness and
   compassion, his thoughts of kindness that have been from of old, his
   present gracious acceptance, it could not bear an hour's absence from
   him; whereas now, perhaps, it cannot watch with him one hour. Let,
   then, this be the saints' first notion of the Father, -- as one full of
   eternal, free love towards them: let their hearts and thoughts be
   filled with breaking through all discouragements that lie in the way.
   To raise them to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, let them consider, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] Whose love it is. It is the love of him who is in himself all
   sufficient, infinitely satiated with himself and his own glorious
   excellencies and perfections; who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no need to go forth with his
   love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others, nor to seek an object of it without himself. There
   might he rest with delight and complacency to eternity. He is
   sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own love. He had his Son, also, his eternal [64]
   Wisdom, to rejoice and delight himself in from all eternity, <reference osisRef="Prov.8.30">Proverbs 8:30</reference> This might take up and satiate the whole delight of the
   Father; but he will love his saints also. And it is such a love, as
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he seeks not his own satisfaction only, but our good in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>
   also; -- the love of a God, the love of a Father, whose proper
   outgoings are kindness and bounty.
				</p><p>
   [2.] What kind of love it is. And it is, --
				</p><p>
   1st. Eternal. It was fixed on us before the [65] foundation of the
   world. Before we were, or had done the least good, then were his
   thoughts upon us, -- then was his delight in us; -- then did the Son
   rejoice in the thoughts of fulfilling his Father's delight in him,
   <reference osisRef="Prov.8.30">Proverbs 8:30</reference> Yea, the delight of the Father in the Son, there
   mentioned, is not so much his absolute delight in him as the express
   image of his person and the brightness of his glory, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he might
   behold all his own excellencies and perfections; as with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his love and his delight in the sons of men. So the order of the words
   require us to understand it: "I was daily his delight," and, "My
   delights were with the sons of men;" -- that is, in the thoughts of
   kindness and redemption for them: and in that respect, also, was he his
   Father's delight. It was from eternity that he laid in his own bosom a
   design for our happiness. The very thought of this is enough to make
   all that is within us, like the babe in the womb of Elisabeth, to leap
   for joy. A sense of it cannot but prostrate our souls to the lowest
   abasement of a humble, holy reverence, and make us rejoice before him
   with trembling.
				</p><p>
   2dly. Free. He [66] loves us because he will; there was, there is,
   nothing in us for which we should be beloved. Did we deserve his love,
   it must go less in its valuation. Things of due debt are seldom the
   matter of thankfulness; but that which is eternally antecedent to our
   being, must needs be absolutely free in its respects to our well-being.
   This gives it life and being, is the reason of it, and sets a price
   upon it, <reference osisRef="Rom.9.11">Romans 9:11</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3-Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:3-4</reference>; <reference osisRef="Titus.3.5">Titus 3:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Jas.1.18">James 1:18</reference>
				</p><p>
   3dly. [67] Unchangeable. Though we change every day, yet his love
   changes<note n="changeth">Auto-modernized</note> not. Could any kind of provocation turn it away, it had long
   since ceased. Its unchangeableness is that which carries<note n="carrieth">Auto-modernized</note> out the
   Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that infiniteness of patience and forbearance (without
   which we die, we perish), <reference osisRef="2Pet.3.9">2 Peter 3:9</reference>, which he exercises<note n="exerciseth">Auto-modernized</note> towards
   us. And it is, --
				</p><p>
   4thly. [68] Distinguishing. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not thus loved all the world:
   "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." Why should he fix his love
   on us, and pass by millions from whom we differ not by [69] nature, --
   that he should make us sharers in that, and all the fruits of it, which
   most of the great and [70] wise men of the world are excluded from? I
   name but the heads of things. Let them enlarge whose hearts are
   touched.
				</p><p>
   Let, I say, the soul frequently eye the love of the Father, and that
   under these considerations, -- they are all soul-conquering and
   endearing.
				</p><p>
   (2.) So eye it as to receive it. Unless this be added, all is in vain
   as to any communion with God. We do not hold communion with him in any
   thing, until it be received by faith. This, then, is that which I would
   provoke the saints of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, even to [71] believe this love of God
   for themselves and their own part, -- believe that such is the heart of
   the Father towards them, -- accept of his witness in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>. His love is
   not ours in the sweetness of it until it be so received. Continually,
   then, act thoughts of faith on God, as love to you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, -- as embracing
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> with the eternal free love before described. When the Lord is, by
   his word, presented as such to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, let your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> mind know it, and assent
   that it is so; and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> will embrace it, in its being so; and all your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   affections be filled with it. Set your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> whole heart to it; let it be
   bound with the cords of this love. [72] If the King be bound in the
   galleries with your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> love, shouldst you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> not be bound in heaven with his?
				</p><p>
   (3.) Let it have its proper fruit and efficacy upon your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> heart, in
   return of love to him again. So shall we walk in the light of God's
   countenance, and hold holy communion with our Father all the day long.
   Let us not deal unkindly with him, and return him slighting for his
   good-will. Let there not be such a heart in us as to deal so
   unthankfully with our God.
				</p><p>
   2. Now, to further us in this duty, and the daily constant practice of
   it, I shall add one or two considerations that may be of importance
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; as, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) It is exceeding acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, even our Father, that we
   should thus hold communion with him in his love, -- that he may be
   received into our souls as one full of love, tenderness, and kindness,
   towards us. Flesh and blood is apt to have very hard thoughts of him,
   -- to think he is always angry, yea, implacable; that it is not for
   poor creatures to draw nigh to him; that nothing in the world is more
   desirable than never to come into his presence, or, as they say where
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any thing to do. "Who [73] among us shall dwell with the
   devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?"
   say the sinners in Zion. [74] And, "I knew you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> were<note n="wast">Auto-modernized</note> an austere man,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the evil servant in the gospels. Now, there is not any thing more
   grievous to the Lord, nor more subservient to the design of Satan upon
   the soul, than such thoughts as these. Satan claps his hands (if I may
   so say) when he can take up the soul with such thoughts of God: he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   enough, -- all that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> desire. This has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been his design and way
   from the beginning. The [75] first blood that murderer shed was by this
   means. He leads our first parents into hard thoughts of God: "Has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> God
   said so? has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he threatened you with death? He knows well enough it
   will be better with you;" -- with this engine did he batter and
   overthrow all mankind [76] in one; and being mindful of his ancient
   conquest, he readily uses<note n="useth">Auto-modernized</note> the same weapons with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> then he so
   successfully contended. Now, it is exceeding grievous to the Spirit of
   God to be so slandered in the hearts of those whom he dearly loves. How
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he expostulate this with Zion! "What iniquity [77] have ye seen in
   me?" says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he; "have I been a wilderness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, or a land of
   darkness?" [78] "Zion said, The Lord has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> forsaken me, and my Lord has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   forgotten me. Can a woman," etc. The Lord takes nothing worse at the
   hands of his, than such hard thoughts of him, knowing full well what
   fruit this bitter root is like to bear, -- what alienations of heart,
   -- what drawings back, -- what unbelief and tergiversations in our
   walking with him. How unwilling is a child to come into the presence of
   an angry father! Consider, then, this in the first place, -- receiving
   of the Father as he holds out love to the soul, gives him the honour he
   aims at, and is exceeding acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. He often sets it out in
   an eminent manner, that it may be so received:  "He commends<note n="commendeth">Auto-modernized</note> his
   love toward us," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.8">Romans 5:8</reference> "Behold, what manner of love the Father
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> bestowed upon us!" <reference osisRef="1John.3.1">1 John 3:1</reference> From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>, then, is this folly? Men
   are afraid to have good thoughts of God. They think it a boldness to
   eye God as good, gracious, tender, kind, loving: I speak of saints; but
   for the other side, they can judge him hard, austere, severe, almost
   implacable, and fierce (the very worst affections of the very worst of
   men, and most hated of him, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.31">Romans 1:31</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Tim.3.3">2 Timothy 3:3</reference>), and think
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> they do well. Is not this soul-deceit from Satan? Was it not his
   design from the beginning to inject such thoughts of God? Assure
   yourself<note n="thyself">Auto-modernized</note>, then, there is nothing more acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father, than
   for us to keep up our hearts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as the eternal fountain of all
   that rich grace which flows out to sinners in the blood of Jesus. And,
   --
				</p><p>
   (2.) This will be exceeding effectual to endear your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> soul to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, to
   cause you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> to delight in him, and to make your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> abode with him. Many
   saints have no greater burden in their lives, than that their hearts do
   not come clearly and fully up, constantly to delight and rejoice in
   God, -- that there is still an indisposedness of spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> close
   walking with him. What is at the bottom of this distemper? Is it not
   their unskilfulness in or neglect of this duty, even of holding
   communion with the Father in love? So much as we see of the love of
   God, so much shall we delight in him, and no more. Every other
   discovery of God, without this, will but make the soul fly from Him;
   but if the heart be once much taken up with this the eminency of the
   Father's love, it cannot choose but be overpowered, conquered, and
   endeared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. This, if any thing, will work upon us to make our
   abode with him. If the love of a father will not make a child delight
   in him, what will? Put, then, this to the venture: exercise your
   thoughts upon this very thing, the eternal, free, and fruitful love of
   the Father, and see if your hearts be not wrought upon to delight in
   him. I dare boldly say, believers will find it as thriving a course as
   ever they pitched on in their lives. Sit down a little at the fountain,
   and you will quickly have a farther discovery of the sweetness of the
   streams. You who have run from him, will not be able, after a while, to
   keep at a distance for a moment.
				</p><p>
   Objection 1. But some may say, "Alas! how shall I hold communion with
   the Father in love? I know not at all whether he loves me or no; and
   shall I venture to cast myself upon it? How if I should not be
   accepted? should I not rather perish for my presumption, than find
   sweetness in his bosom? God seems to me only as a consuming fire and
   everlasting burnings; so that I dread to look up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him."
				</p><p>
   Answer. I know not what may be understood by knowing of the love of
   God; though it be carried on by spiritual sense and experience, yet it
   is received purely by believing. Our knowing of it, is our believing of
   it as revealed. "We have known and believed the love that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to
   us. God is love," <reference osisRef="1John.4.16">1 John 4:16</reference> This is the assurance which, at the
   very entrance of walking with God, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> mayest have of this love. He
   who is truth has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> said it; and whatever your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> heart says, or Satan says,
   unless you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> take it up on this account, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> doest your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> endeavour
   to make him a liar who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> spoken it, <reference osisRef="1John.5.10">1 John 5:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   Obj. 2. "I can believe that God is love to others, for he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> said he
   is love; but that he will be so to me, I see no ground of persuasion;
   there is no cause, no reason in the world, why he should turn one
   thought of love or kindness towards me: and therefore I dare not cast
   myself upon it, to hold communion with him in his special love."
				</p><p>
   Ans. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> spoken it as particularly to you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> as to any one in the
   world. And for cause of love, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> as much to fix it on you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> as on
   any of the children of men; that is, none at all without himself. So
   that I shall make speedy work with this objection. Never any one from
   the foundation of the world, who believed such love in the Father, and
   made returns of love to him again, was deceived; neither shall ever any
   to the world's end be so, in so doing. You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note>, then, in this, upon a
   most sure bottom. If you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> believest and receivest the Father as love,
   he will infallibly be so to you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, though others may fall under his
   severity. But, --
				</p><p>
   Obj. 3. "I cannot find my heart making returns of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. Could
   I find my soul set upon him, I could then believe his soul delighted in
   me."
				</p><p>
   Ans. This is the most preposterous course that possibly your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> thoughts
   can pitch upon, a most ready way to rob God of his glory. "In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is
   love," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Ghost, "not that we loved God, but that he loved
   us" first, <reference osisRef="1John.4.10-1John.4.11">1 John 4:10-11</reference> Now, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> wouldst invert this order, and
   say, "In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is love, not that God loved me, but that I love him
   first." This is to take the glory of God from him: that, whereas he
   loves us without a cause that is in ourselves, and we have all cause in
   the world to love him, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> wouldst have the contrary, namely, that
   something should be in you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> for which God should love you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, even your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   love to him; and that you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shouldst love God, before you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> know<note n="knowest">Auto-modernized</note> any
   thing lovely in him, -- namely, whether he love you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> or no. This is a
   course of flesh's finding out, that will never bring glory to God, nor
   peace to your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> own soul. Lay down, then, your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> reasonings; take up the love
   of the Father upon a pure act of believing, and that will open your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> soul
   to let it out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord in the communion of love.
				</p><p>
   To make yet some farther improvement of this truth so opened and
   exhorted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> as before; -- it will discover to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us the eminency and
   privilege of the saints of God. What low thoughts soever the sons of
   men may have of them, it will appear that they have meat to eat that
   the world knows not of. They have close communion and fellowship with
   the Father. They deal with him in the interchange of love. Men are
   generally esteemed according to the company they keep. It is an honour
   to stand in the presence of princes, though but as servants. What
   honour, then, have all the saints, to stand with boldness in the
   presence of the Father, and there to enjoy his bosom love! What a
   blessing did the queen of Sheba pronounce on the servants of Solomon,
   who stood before him, and heard his wisdom! How much more blessed,
   then, are they who stand continually before the God of Solomon, hearing
   his wisdom, enjoying his love! While<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> others have their fellowship with
   Satan and their own lusts, making provision for them, and receiving
   perishing refreshments from them, ("whose end is destruction, whose god
   is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly
   things,") they have this sweet communion with the Father.
				</p><p>
   Moreover, what a safe and sweet retreat is here for the saints, in all
   the scorns, reproaches, scandals, misrepresentations, which they
   undergo in the world. When [79] a child is abused abroad in the streets
   by strangers, he runs with speed to the bosom of his father; there he
   makes his complaint, and is comforted. In all the hard [80] censures
   and tongue-persecutions which the saints meet withal in the streets of
   the world, they may run with their moanings to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their Father, and be
   comforted. "As one whom his mother comforts<note n="comforteth">Auto-modernized</note>, so will I comfort you,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord, <reference osisRef="Isa.66.13">Isaiah 66:13</reference> So that the soul may say, "If I have
   hatred in the world, I will go where I am sure of love. Though all
   others are hard to me, yet my Father is tender and full of compassion:
   I will go to him, and satisfy myself in him. Here I am accounted vile,
   frowned on, and rejected; but I have honour and love with him, whose
   kindness is better than life itself. There I shall have all things in
   the fountain, which others have but in the drops. There is in my
   Father's love every thing desirable: there is the sweetness of all
   mercies in the abstract itself, and that fully and durably."
				</p><p>
   Evidently, then, the saints are the most mistaken men in the world. If
   they say, [81] "Come and have fellowship with us;" are not men ready to
   say, "Why, what are you? a sorry company of [82] seditious, factious
   persons. Be it known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, that we despise your fellowship. When we
   intend to leave fellowship with all honest men, and men of worth, then
   will we come to you." But, alas! how are men mistaken! Truly their
   fellowship is with the Father: let men think of it as they please, they
   have close, spiritual, heavenly refreshing, in the mutual communication
   of love with the Father himself. How they are generally misconceived,
   the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="2Cor.6.8-2Cor.6.10">2 Corinthians 6:8-10</reference>, "As deceivers, and yet true; as
   unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as
   chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor,
   yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all
   things." And as it is thus in general, so in no one thing more than
   this, that they are looked on as poor, low, despicable persons, when
   indeed they are the only great and noble personages in the world.
   Consider the company they keep: it is with the Father; -- who so
   glorious? The merchandise they trade in, it is love; -- what so
   precious? Doubtless they are the excellent on the earth, <reference osisRef="Ps.16.3">Psalms 16:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   Farther; this will discover a main difference between the saints and
   empty professors:  As to the performance of duties, and so the
   enjoyment of outward privileges, fruitless professors often walk hand
   in hand with them; but now come to their secret retirements, and what a
   difference is there! There the saints hold communion with God:
   hypocrites, for the most part, with the world and their own lusts; --
   with them they converse and communicate; they hearken what they will
   say to them, and make provision for them, when the saints are sweetly
   wrapt up in the bosom of their Father's love. It is oftentimes even
   almost impossible that believers should, in outward appearance, go
   beyond them who have very rotten hearts: but this meat they have, which
   others know not of; this refreshment in the banqueting house, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   others have no share; -- in the multitude of their thoughts, the
   comforts of God their Father refresh their souls.
				</p><p>
   Now, then (to draw towards a close of this discourse), if these things
   be so, "what manner of men ought we to be, in all manner of holy
   conversation?" Even "our God is a consuming fire." What communion is
   there between light and darkness? Shall sin and lust dwell in those
   thoughts which receive in and carry out love from and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father?
   Holiness becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> his presence for ever. An unclean spirit cannot draw
   nigh to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; -- an unholy heart can make no abode with him. A lewd
   person will not desire to hold fellowship with a sober man; and will a
   man of vain and foolish imaginations hold communion and dwell with the
   most holy God? There is not any consideration of this love but is a
   powerful motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> holiness, and leads to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Ephraim says, "What
   have I to do any more with idols?" when in God he finds salvation.
   Communion with the Father is wholly inconsistent with loose walking.
   "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not the truth," <reference osisRef="1John.1.6">1 John 1:6</reference> "He that says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, I know him" (I
   have communion with him), "and keeps<note n="keepeth">Auto-modernized</note> not his commandments, is a liar,
   and the truth is not in him," chap. ii. 4. The most specious and
   glorious pretence made to an acquaintance with the Father, without
   holiness and obedience to his commandments, serves only to prove the
   pretenders to be liars. The love of the world and of the Father dwell
   not together.
				</p><p>
   And if this be so (to shut up all), how many that go under the name of
   Christians, come short of the truth of it! How unacquainted are the
   generality of professors with the mystery of this communion, and the
   fruits of it! Do not many very evidently hold communion with their
   lusts and with the world, and yet would be thought to have a portion
   and inheritance among them that are sanctified? They have neither new
   name nor white stone, and yet would be called the people of the Most
   High. May it not be said of many of them, rather, that God is not in
   all their thoughts, than that they have communion with him? The Lord
   open the eyes of men, that they may see and know that walking with God
   is a matter not of form, but power! And so far of peculiar communion
   with the Father, in the instance of love which we have insisted on. "He
   is also faithful who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> called us to the fellowship of his Son Jesus
   Christ our Lord;" -- of which in the next place.

<title>Part II. Of Communion with the Son Jesus Christ</title>
<p></p>

<title>Part 2 Chapter 1</title>
<p>
   Of the fellowship which the saints have with Jesus Christ the Son of
   God -- That they have such a fellowship proved, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.9">1 Corinthians 1:9</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference>; <reference osisRef="Song.2.1-Song.2.7">Song of Solomon 2:1-7</reference> opened; also <reference osisRef="Prov.9.1-Prov.9.5">Proverbs 9:1-5</reference>
				</p><p>
   Of that distinct communion which we have with the person of the Father
   we have treated in the foregoing chapters; we now proceed to the
   consideration of that which we have with his Son, Jesus Christ our
   Lord. Now the fellowship we have with the second person, is with him as
   Mediator, -- in that office to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, by dispensation, he submitted
   himself for our sakes; being "made of a woman, made under the law, to
   redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption
   of sons," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4-Gal.4.5">Galatians 4:4-5</reference> And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> I shall do these two things:  I.
   Declare that we have such fellowship with the Son of God. II. Show
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> that fellowship or communion does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist: 
				</p><p>
   I. For the first, I shall only produce some few places of Scripture to
   confirm it, that it is so:  <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.9">1 Corinthians 1:9</reference>, "God is faithful, by whom ye
   were called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord." This
   is that to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> all the saints are called, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, by the
   faithfulness of God, they shall be preserved, even fellowship with
   Jesus Christ our Lord. We are called of God the Father, as the Father,
   in pursuit of his love, to communion with the Son, as our Lord.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference>, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear
   my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
   him, and he with me." [83] Certainly this is fellowship, or I know not
   what is. Christ will sup with believers: he refreshes himself with his
   own graces in them, by his Spirit bestowed on them. The Lord Christ is
   exceedingly delighted in tasting of the sweet fruits of the Spirit in
   the saints. Hence is that prayer of the spouse that she may have
   something for his entertainment when he comes to her, <reference osisRef="Song.4.16">Song of Solomon 4:16</reference>,
   "Awake, O north wind; and come, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> south; blow upon my garden, that
   the spices of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> may flow out. Let my Beloved come into his garden,
   and eat his pleasant fruits." The souls of the saints are the garden of
   Jesus Christ, the good ground, <reference osisRef="Heb.6.7">Hebrews 6:7</reference>; -- a garden for delight; he
   rejoices in them; "his delights are with the sons of men," <reference osisRef="Prov.8.31">Proverbs 8:31</reference>; and he "rejoices over them," <reference osisRef="Zeph.3.17">Zephaniah 3:17</reference>; -- and a garden for
   fruit, yea, pleasant fruit; so he describes it, <reference osisRef="Song.4.12-Song.4.14">Song of Solomon 4:12-14</reference>, "A
   garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain
   sealed. Your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
   fruits; camphire, with spikenard, spikenard and saffron; calamus and
   cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all
   chief spices." Whatever is sweet and delicious for taste, whatever
   savoury and odoriferous, whatever is useful and medicinal, is in this
   garden. There is all manner of spiritual refreshments, of all kinds
   whatever, in the souls of the saints, for the Lord Jesus. On this
   account is the spouse so earnest in the prayer mentioned for an
   increase of these things, that her Beloved may sup with her, as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   promised. "Awake, O north wind," etc.; -- "O that the breathings and
   workings of the Spirit of all grace might stir up all his gifts and
   graces in me, that the Lord Jesus, the beloved of my soul, may have
   meet and acceptable entertainment from me." God complains of want of
   fruit in his vineyard, <reference osisRef="Isa.5.2">Isaiah 5:2</reference>; <reference osisRef="Hos.10.1">Hosea 10:1</reference> Want of good food for
   Christ's entertainment is that the spouse feared, and labours to
   prevent. A barren heart is not fit to receive him. And the delight he
   takes in the fruit of the Spirit is unspeakable. This he expresses at
   large, <reference osisRef="Song.5.1">Song of Solomon 5:1</reference>, "I am come," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he; "I have eaten, I am
   refreshed." He calls it pry mgdym, "The fruit of his sweetnesses;" or
   most pleasant to him. Moreover, as Christ sups with his saints, so he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised they shall sup with him, to complete that fellowship they
   have with him. Christ provides for their entertainment in a most
   eminent manner. There are beasts killed, and wine is mingled, and a
   table furnished, <reference osisRef="Prov.9.2">Proverbs 9:2</reference> He calls the spiritual dainties that he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> for them a "feast," a "wedding," [84] "a feast of fat things, wine
   on the lees," etc. The fatted calf is killed for their entertainment.
   Such is the communion, and such is the mutual entertainment of Christ
   and his saints in that communion.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="Song.2.1-Song.2.7">Song of Solomon 2:1-7</reference>, "I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
   As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. As the
   apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my Beloved among the
   sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was
   sweet to my taste," etc.
				</p><p>
   In the two first verses you have the description that Christ gives,
   first of himself, then of his church. Of himself, verse 1; that is,
   what he is to his spouse: "I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the
   valleys." The Lord [85] Christ is, in the Scripture, compared to all
   things of eminency in the whole creation. He is in the heavens the sun,
   and the bright morning star: as the lion among the beasts, the lion of
   the tribe of Judah. Among the flowers of the field, here he is the rose
   and the lily. The two eminencies of flowers, sweetness of savour and
   beauty of colour, are divided between these. The rose for sweetness,
   and the lily for beauty ("Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
   one of these"), have the pre-eminence. Farther, he is "the rose of
   Sharon," a fruitful plain, where the choicest herds were fed, <reference osisRef="1Chr.27.29">1 Chronicles 27:29</reference>; so eminent, that it is promised to the church that there
   shall be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> her the [86] excellency of Sharon, <reference osisRef="Isa.35.2">Isaiah 35:2</reference>
   This fruitful place, doubtless, brought forth the most precious roses.
   Christ, in the savour of his love, and in his righteousness (which is
   as the garment in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Jacob received his blessing, giving forth a
   smell as the smell of a pleasant field, <reference osisRef="Gen.27.27">Genesis 27:27</reference>), is as this
   excellent rose, to draw and allure the hearts of his saints to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
   As God smelled a sweet savour from the blood of his atonement, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.2">Ephesians 5:2</reference>; so from the graces with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> for them he is anointed, his saints
   receive a refreshing, cherishing savour, <reference osisRef="Song.1.3">Song of Solomon 1:3</reference> A sweet savour
   expresses that which is acceptable and delightful, <reference osisRef="Gen.8.21">Genesis 8:21</reference> He is
   also "the lily of the valleys;" that of all flowers is the most eminent
   in beauty, <reference osisRef="Matt.6.29">Matthew 6:29</reference> Most desirable is he, for the comeliness and
   perfection of his person; incomparably fairer than the children of men:
   of which afterward. He, then, being thus to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them (abundantly
   satiating all their spiritual senses) their refreshment, their
   ornament, their delight, their glory; in the next verse he tells us
   what they are to him: "As the lily among thorns, so is my beloved among
   the daughters." That Christ and his church are likened to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and termed
   the same thing (as here the lily), is, as from their union by the
   indwelling of the same Spirit, so from that [87] conformity and
   likeness that is between them, and to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints are appointed.
   Now she is a lily, very beautiful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ; "as the lily among
   thorns:" -- 1. By the way of eminency; as the lily excels<note n="excelleth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   thorns, so do the saints all others whatever, in the eye of Christ. Let
   comparison be made, so will it be found to be. And, -- 2. By the way of
   trial; the residue of the world being "pricking briers and grieving
   thorns to the house of Israel," <reference osisRef="Ezek.28.24">Ezekiel 28:24</reference> "The best of them is
   as a brier, the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge," <reference osisRef="Mic.7.4">Micah 7:4</reference> And thus are they among the daughters, -- even the most eminent
   collections of the most improved professors, that are no more but so.
   There cannot be in any greater comparison, a greater exaltation of the
   excellency of any thing. So, then, is Christ to them indeed, verse 1;
   so are they in his esteem, and indeed, verse 2. How he is in their
   esteem and indeed, we have, verse 3.
				</p><p>
   "As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my Beloved among
   the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
   was sweet to my taste." To carry on this intercourse, the spouse begins
   to speak her thoughts of, and to show her delight in, the Lord Christ;
   and as he compares her to the lily among the thorns, so she him to the
   apple-tree among the trees of the wood. And she adds this reason of it,
   even because he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the two eminent things of trees, which the residue
   of them have not:  1. Fruit for food; 2. Shade for refreshment. Of the
   one she eats<note n="eateth">Auto-modernized</note>, under the other she rests<note n="resteth">Auto-modernized</note>; both with great delight.
   All other sons, either angels, the sons of God by creation, <reference osisRef="Job.1.6">Job 1:6</reference>,
   xxxviii. 7, or the sons of Adam, -- the best of his offspring, the
   leaders of those companies which, verse 2, are called daughters, or
   sons of the old creation, the top branches of all its desirable things,
   -- are to an hungry, weary soul (such alone seek for shade and fruit)
   but as the fruitless, leafless trees of the forest, which will yield
   them neither food nor refreshment. "In Christ," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> she, "there is
   fruit, fruit sweet to the taste; yea, his flesh is meat indeed, and his
   blood is drink indeed,'?" <reference osisRef="John.6.55">John 6:55</reference> "Moreover, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> brought forth
   that everlasting righteousness which will abundantly satisfy any hungry
   soul, after it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> gone to many a barren tree for food, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> found
   none. Besides, he abounds<note n="aboundeth">Auto-modernized</note> in precious and pleasant graces, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> I
   may [88] eat; yea, he calls me to do so, and that abundantly." These
   are the fruits that Christ bears<note n="beareth">Auto-modernized</note>. They speak of a tree that brings<note n="bringeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   forth all things needful for life, in food and raiment. Christ is that
   tree of life, which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> brought forth all things that are needful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   life eternal. In him is that righteousness which we [89] hunger after;
   -- in him is that water of life, which whoso [90] drinks<note n="drinketh">Auto-modernized</note> of shall
   thirst no more. Oh, how sweet are the fruits of Christ's mediation to
   the faith of his saints! He that can find no relief in mercy, pardon,
   grace, acceptation with God, holiness, sanctification, etc., is an
   utter stranger to these things ( [91] wine on the lees) that are
   prepared for believers. Also, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> shades for refreshment and
   shelter; -- shelter from wrath without, and refreshment because of
   weariness from within. The first use of the [92] shade is to keep us
   from the heat of the sun, as did Jonah's gourd. When the heat of wrath
   is ready to scorch the soul, Christ, interposing, bears it all. Under
   the shadow of his wings we sit down constantly, quietly, safely,
   putting our trust in him; and all this with great delight. Yea, who can
   express the joy of a soul safe shadowed from wrath under the covert of
   the righteousness of the Lord Jesus! There is also refreshment in a
   shade from weariness. He is "as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
   land," <reference osisRef="Isa.32.2">Isaiah 32:2</reference> From the power of corruptions, trouble of
   temptations, distress of persecutions, there is in him quiet, rest, and
   repose, <reference osisRef="Matt.11.27-Matt.11.28">Matthew 11:27-28</reference>
				</p><p>
   Having thus mutually described each other, and so made it manifest that
   they cannot but be delighted in fellowship and communion, in the next
   verses that communion of theirs is at large set forth and described. I
   shall briefly observe four things in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>:  (1.) Sweetness. (2.)
   Delight. (3.) Safety. (4.) Comfort.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Sweetness: "He brought me to the banqueting-house," or "house of
   wine." It is all set forth under expressions of the greatest sweetness
   and most delicious refreshment, -- flagons, apples, wine, etc. "He
   entertains me," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the spouse, "as some great personage." Great
   personages, at great entertainments, are had into the banqueting-house,
   -- the house of wine and dainties. These are the preparations of grace
   and mercy, -- love, kindness, supplies revealed in the gospel, declared
   in the assemblies of the saints, exhibited by the Spirit. This "love is
   better than wine," <reference osisRef="Song.1.2">Song of Solomon 1:2</reference>; it is "not meat and drink, but
   righteousness, and [93] peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." Gospel
   dainties are sweet refreshments; whether these houses of wine be the
   Scriptures, the gospel, or the ordinances dispensed in the assemblies
   of the saints, or any eminent and signal manifestations of special love
   (as banqueting is not every day's work, nor used at ordinary
   entertainments), it is all one. Wine, that cheers<note n="cheereth">Auto-modernized</note> the heart of man,
   that makes him forget his misery, <reference osisRef="Prov.31.6-Prov.31.7">Proverbs 31:6-7</reference>, that gives him a
   cheerful look and countenance, <reference osisRef="Gen.49.12">Genesis 49:12</reference>, is that which is
   promised. The grace exhibited by Christ in his ordinances is
   refreshing, strengthening, comforting, and full of sweetness to the
   souls of the saints. Woe be to such full souls as loathe these
   honey-combs! But thus Christ makes all his assemblies to be
   banqueting-houses; and there he gives his saints entertainment.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Delight. The spouse is quite ravished with the sweetness of this
   entertainment, finding love, and care, and kindness, bestowed by Christ
   in the assemblies of the saints. Hence she cries out, verse 5, "Stay me
   with flagons, comfort me with apples; for I am sick of love." Upon the
   discovery of the excellency and sweetness of Christ in the
   banqueting-house, the soul is instantly overpowered, and cries out to
   be made partaker of the fulness of it. She is "sick of love:" not (as
   some suppose) fainting for want of a sense of love, under the
   apprehension of wrath; but made sick and faint, even overcome, with the
   mighty actings of that divine affection, after she had once tasted of
   the sweetness of Christ in the banqueting-house. Her desire deferred,
   makes her heart sick; therefore she cries, "Stay me," etc.; -- "I have
   seen a glimpse of the King in his beauty,' -- tasted of the fruit of
   his righteousness; my soul melts<note n="melteth">Auto-modernized</note> in longing after him. Oh! support
   and sustain my spirit with his presence in his ordinances, -- those
   flagons and apples of his banqueting-house,' -- or I shall quite sink
   and faint! Oh, what have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> done, blessed Jesus! I have seen you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>,
   and my soul is become as the chariots of Ammi-nadib. Let me have
   something from you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> to support me, or I die." When a person is fainting
   on any occasion, these two things are to be done:  strength is to be
   used to support him, that he sink not to the ground; and comfortable
   things are to be applied, to refresh his spirits. These two the soul,
   overpowered and fainting with the force of its own love, (raised by a
   sense of Christ's,) prays<note n="prayeth">Auto-modernized</note> for. It would have strengthening grace to
   support it in that condition, that it may be able to attend its duty;
   and consolations of the Holy Ghost, to content, revive, and satiate it,
   until it come to a full enjoyment of Christ. And thus sweetly and with
   delight is this communion carried on.
				</p><p>
   (3.) Safety: "His banner over me was love," verse 4. The banner is an
   emblem of safety and protection, -- a sign of the presence of an host.
   Persons belonging to an army do encamp under their banner in security.
   So did the children of Israel in the wilderness; every tribe kept their
   camps under their own standard. It is also a token of success and
   victory, <reference osisRef="Ps.20.5">Psalms 20:5</reference> Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a banner for his saints; and that is
   love. All their protection is from his love; and they shall have all
   the protection his love can give them. This safeguards them from hell,
   death, -- all their enemies. Whatever presses on them, it must pass
   through the banner of the love of the Lord Jesus. They have, then,
   great spiritual safety; which is another ornament or excellency of
   their communion with him.
				</p><p>
   (4.) Support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note> and consolation, verse 6, "His left hand is under my
   head, and his right hand does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> embrace me." Christ here has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the posture
   of a most tender friend towards any one in sickness and sadness. The
   soul faints with love, -- spiritual longings after the enjoyment of his
   presence; and Christ comes in with his embraces. He nourishes<note n="nourisheth">Auto-modernized</note> and
   cherishes<note n="cherisheth">Auto-modernized</note> his church, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.29">Ephesians 5:29</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.63.9">Isaiah 63:9</reference> Now, "the hand under
   the head," is support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note>, sustaining grace, in pressures and
   difficulties; and "the hand that does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> embrace," the hand upon the
   heart, is joy and consolation; -- in both, Christ rejoicing, as the
   "bridegroom rejoices<note n="rejoiceth">Auto-modernized</note> over the bride," <reference osisRef="Isa.62.5">Isaiah 62:5</reference> Now, thus to lie
   in the arms of Christ's love, under a perpetual influence of
   support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note> and refreshment, is certainly to hold communion with him.
   And hereupon, verse 7, the spouse is most earnest for the continuance
   of his fellowship, charging all so to demean themselves, that her
   Beloved be not disquieted, or provoked to depart.
				</p><p>
   In brief, this whole book is taken up in the description of the
   communion that is between the Lord Christ and his saints; and
   therefore, it is very needless to take from thence any more particular
   instances of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>
				</p><p>
   I shall only add that of <reference osisRef="Prov.9.1-Prov.9.5">Proverbs 9:1-5</reference>, "Wisdom has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> builded her house,
   she has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> hewn out her seven pillars; she has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> killed her beasts; she
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> mingled her wine; she has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> also furnished her table. She has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent
   forth her maidens: she cries<note n="crieth">Auto-modernized</note> upon the highest places of the city,
   Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wants<note n="wanteth">Auto-modernized</note>
   understanding, she says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> to him, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of
   the wine which I have mingled."
				</p><p>
   The Lord Christ, the eternal Wisdom of the Father, and who of God is
   made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us wisdom, erects a spiritual house, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he makes
   provision for the entertainment of those guests whom he so freely
   invites. His church is the house which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> built on a perfect
   number of pillars, that it might have a stable foundation: his slain
   beasts and mingled wine, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> his table is furnished, are those
   spiritual fat things of the gospel, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> prepared for those
   that come in upon his invitation. Surely, to eat of this bread, and
   drink of this wine, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> so graciously prepared, is to hold
   fellowship with him; for in what ways or things is there nearer
   communion than in such?
				</p><p>
   I might farther evince this truth, by a consideration of all the
   relations in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Christ and his saints do stand; which necessarily
   require that there be a communion between them, if we do suppose they
   are faithful in those relations: but this is commonly treated on, and
   something will be spoken to it in one signal instance afterward.

<title>Part 2 Chapter 2</title>
<p>
   What it is in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have peculiar fellowship with the Lord Christ --
   This is in grace -- This proved, <reference osisRef="John.1.14 John.1.16-John.1.17">John 1:14, 16-17</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.14">2 Corinthians 13:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Thess.3.17-2Thess.3.18">2 Thessalonians 3:17-18</reference> -- Grace of various acceptations -- Personal grace
   in Christ proposed to consideration -- The grace of Christ as Mediator
   intended, <reference osisRef="Ps.45.2">Psalms 45:2</reference> -- <reference osisRef="Song.5.10">Song of Solomon 5:10</reference>, Christ, how white and ruddy -- His
   fitness to save, from the grace of union -- His fulness to save -- His
   suitableness to endear -- These considerations improved.
				</p><p>
   II. Having manifested that the saints hold peculiar fellowship with the
   Lord Jesus, it nextly follows that we show in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is that they have
   this peculiar communion with him.
				</p><p>
   Now, this is in grace. This is everywhere ascribed to him by the way of
   eminency. <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>, "He dwelt among us, full of grace and truth;" --
   grace in the truth and substance of it. [94] All that went before was
   but typical and in representation; in the truth and substance it comes
   only by Christ. "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," verse 17; "and
   of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace," verse 16; --
   that is, we have communion with him in grace; we receive from him all
   manner of grace whatever; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> have we fellowship with him.
				</p><p>
   So likewise in that apostolical benediction, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the communication
   of spiritual blessings from the several persons to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints is so
   exactly distinguished; it is grace that is ascribed to our Lord Jesus
   Christ, <reference osisRef="2Cor.13.14">2 Corinthians 13:14</reference>, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
   love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all."
				</p><p>
   Yea, Paul is so delighted with this, that he makes it his motto, and
   the token through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he would have his epistles known, <reference osisRef="2Thess.3.17-2Thess.3.18">2 Thessalonians 3:17-18</reference>, "The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in
   every epistle: so I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
   you all." Yea, he makes these two, "Grace be with you," and, "The Lord
   Jesus be with you," to be equivalent expressions; for whereas he
   affirmed the one to be the token in all his epistles, yet sometimes he
   uses<note n="useth">Auto-modernized</note> the one only, sometimes the other of these, and sometimes puts
   them both together. This, then, is that which we are peculiarly to eye
   in the Lord Jesus, to receive it from him, even grace, gospel-grace,
   revealed in or exhibited by the gospel. He is the head-stone in the
   building of the temple of God, to whom "Grace, grace," is to be cried,
   <reference osisRef="Zech.4.7">Zechariah 4:7</reference>
				</p><p>
   Grace is a word of various acceptations. In its most eminent
   significations it may be referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one of these three heads: 
				</p><p>
   1. Grace of personal presence and comeliness. [95] So we say, "A
   graceful and comely person," either from himself or his ornaments. This
   in Christ (upon the matter) is the subject of near one-half of the book
   of Canticles; it is also mentioned, <reference osisRef="Ps.45.2">Psalms 45:2</reference>, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> fairer than
   the children of men; grace is poured into your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> lips." And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this
   first head, in respect of Christ, do I refer also that acceptation of
   grace which, in respect of us, I fix in the third place. Those
   inconceivable gifts and fruits of the Spirit which were bestowed on
   him, and brought forth in him, concur to his personal excellency; as
   will afterward appear.
				</p><p>
   2. Grace of free favour and acceptance. [96] "By this grace we are
   saved;" that is, the free favour and gracious acceptation of God in
   Christ. In this sense is it used in that frequent expression, "If I
   have found grace in your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> sight;" that is, if I be freely and favourably
   accepted before you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>. So he "gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> grace" (that is, favour) "to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   humble," <reference osisRef="Jas.4.6">James 4:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gen.39.21">Genesis 39:21</reference>, xli. 37; <reference osisRef="Acts.7.10">Acts 7:10</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Sam.2.26">1 Samuel 2:26</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Kgs.25.27">2 Kings 25:27</reference>, etc.
				</p><p>
   3. The fruits of the Spirit, sanctifying and renewing our natures,
   enabling to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> good, and preventing from evil, are so termed. Thus the
   Lord tells Paul, "his grace was sufficient for him;" that is, the
   assistance against temptation which he afforded him, <reference osisRef="Col.3.16">Colossians 3:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.8.6-2Cor.8.7">2 Corinthians 8:6-7</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.12.28">Hebrews 12:28</reference>
				</p><p>
   These two latter, as relating to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ in respect of us who receive
   them, I call purchased grace, being indeed purchased by him for us; and
   our communion with him in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is termed a "fellowship in his
   sufferings, and the power of his resurrection," <reference osisRef="Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   1. Let us begin with the first, which I call personal grace; and
   concerning that do these two things:  (1.) Show what it is, and
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note>; I mean the personal grace of Christ. And, --
   (2.) Declare how the saints hold immediate communion with him in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   (1.) To the handling of the first, I shall only premise this
   observation:  It is Christ as mediator of whom we speak; and
   therefore, by the "grace of his person," I understand not, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] The glorious excellencies of his Deity considered in itself,
   abstracting from the office which for us, as God and man, he undertook.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Nor the outward appearance of his human nature, neither when he
   conversed here on earth, bearing our infirmities (of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>, by reason of
   the charge that was laid upon him, the prophet gives quite another
   character, <reference osisRef="Isa.52.14">Isaiah 52:14</reference>), concerning which some of the ancients were
   very poetical in their expressions; nor yet as now exalted in glory; --
   a vain imagination of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> makes many bear a false, a corrupted respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, even upon carnal apprehensions of the mighty exaltation of
   the human nature; which is but "to know Christ after the flesh," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.16">2 Corinthians 5:16</reference>, a mischief much improved by the abomination of foolish imagery.
   But this is that which I intend, -- the graces of the person of Christ
   as he is vested with the office of mediation, this spiritual eminency,
   comeliness, and beauty, as appointed and anointed by the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the great work of bringing home all his elect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his bosom.
				</p><p>
   Now, in this respect the Scripture describes him as exceeding
   excellent, comely, and desirable, -- far above comparison with the
   chiefest, choicest created good, or any endearment imaginable.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="Ps.45.2">Psalms 45:2</reference>, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> fairer than the children of men: grace is poured
   into your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> lips." [97] He is, beyond comparison, more beautiful and
   gracious than any here below, yphyphyt, (japhiaphitha); the word is
   doubled, to increase its significance, and to exalt its subject beyond
   all comparison. svphrk mlk' msych' dyph mvny ns', says the Chaldee
   paraphrast: "Your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> fairness, O king Messiah, is more excellent than the
   sons of men." "Pulcher admodum prae filiis hominum;" -- exceeding
   desirable. Inward beauty and glory is here expressed by that of outward
   shape, form, and appearance; [98] because that was so much esteemed in
   those who were to rule or govern. <reference osisRef="Isa.4.2">Isaiah 4:2</reference>, the prophet, terming of
   him "The branch of the Lord," and "The fruit of the earth," affirms
   that he shall be "beautiful and glorious, excellent and comely;" "for
   in him dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> all the fulness of the Godhead bodily," <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference>
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="Song.5.9">Song of Solomon 5:9</reference>, the spouse is inquired of as to this very thing, even
   concerning the personal excellencies of the Lord Christ, her beloved:
   "What is your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Beloved" (say the daughters of Jerusalem) "more than
   another beloved, O you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> fairest among women? what is your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Beloved more
   than another beloved?" and she returns this answer, verse 10, "My
   Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand;" and so
   proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> to a particular description of him by his excellencies to
   the end of the chapter, and there concludes<note n="concludeth">Auto-modernized</note> that "he is altogether
   lovely," verse 16; of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> at large afterward. Particularly, he is here
   affirmed to be "white and ruddy;" a due mixture of which colours
   composes the most beautiful complexion.
				</p><p>
   1st. He is white in the glory of his Deity, and ruddy in the
   preciousness of his humanity. "His teeth are white with milk, and his
   eyes are red with wine," <reference osisRef="Gen.49.12">Genesis 49:12</reference> Whiteness (if I may so say) is
   the complexion of glory. In that appearance of the Most High, the
   "Ancient of days," <reference osisRef="Dan.7.9">Daniel 7:9</reference>, it is said, "His garment was white as
   snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool;" -- and of Christ in
   his transfiguration, when he had on him a mighty lustre of the Deity,
   "His face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the
   light," <reference osisRef="Matt.17.2">Matthew 17:2</reference>; which, in the phrase of another evangelist, is,
   "White as snow, so as no fuller on earth can white them," <reference osisRef="Mark.9.3">Mark 9:3</reference>
   It was a divine, heavenly, surpassing glory that was upon him, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.14">Revelation of John 1:14</reference> Hence the angels and glorified saints, that always behold him, and
   are fully translated into the image of the same glory, are still said
   to be in white robes. [99] His whiteness is his Deity, and the glory
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. And on this account the Chaldee paraphrast ascribes this whole
   passage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. "They say," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "to the house of Israel, Who is
   the God whom you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> serve?' etc. Then began the congregation of
   Israel to declare the praises of the Ruler of the world, and said, I
   will serve that God who is clothed in a garment white as snow, the
   splendour of the glory of whose countenance is as fire.'?" He is also
   ruddy in the beauty of his humanity. Man was called Adam, from the red
   earth of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he was made. The word here [100] used points him out as
   the second Adam, partaker of flesh and blood, because the children also
   partook of the same, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference> The beauty and comeliness of the Lord
   Jesus in the union of both these in one person, shall afterward be
   declared.
				</p><p>
   2dly. He is white in the beauty of his innocency and holiness, and
   ruddy in the blood of his oblation. Whiteness is the badge of innocence
   and holiness. It is said of the Nazarites, for their typical holiness,
   "They were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk," <reference osisRef="Lam.4.7">Lamentations 4:7</reference>
   And the prophet shows us that scarlet, red, and crimson, are the
   colours of sin and guilt; whiteness of innocency, [101] <reference osisRef="Isa.1.18">Isaiah 1:18</reference> Our
   Beloved was "a Lamb without blemish and without spot," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.19">1 Peter 1:19</reference>
   "He did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.22">1 Peter 2:22</reference>
   He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26">Hebrews 7:26</reference>; as afterward will appear. And yet he who was so white in his
   innocence, was made ruddy in his own blood; and that two ways: 
   Naturally, in the pouring out of his blood, his precious blood, in that
   agony of his soul when thick drops of blood trickled to the ground,
   <reference osisRef="Luke.22.44">Luke 22:44</reference>; as also when the whips and thorns, nails and spears,
   poured it out abundantly: "There came forth blood and water," <reference osisRef="John.19.34">John 19:34</reference> He was ruddy by being drenched all over in his own blood. And
   morally, by the imputation of sin, whose colour is red and crimson.
   "God made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference> He who
   was white, became ruddy for our sakes, pouring out his blood an
   oblation for sin. This also renders him graceful: by his whiteness he
   fulfilled the law; by his redness he satisfied justice. "This is our
   Beloved, O ye daughters of Jerusalem."
				</p><p>
   3dly. His endearing excellency in the administration of his kingdom is
   hereby also expressed. [102] He is white in love and mercy to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   own; red with justice and revenge towards his enemies, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.3">Isaiah 63:3</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="Rev.19.13">Revelation of John 19:13</reference>
				</p><p>
   There are three things in general in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this personal excellency and
   grace of the Lord Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist:  (1st.) His fitness to save,
   from the grace of union, and the proper necessary effects of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
   (2dly.) His fulness to save, from the grace of communion; or the free
   consequences of the grace of union. (3dly.) His excellency to endear,
   from his complete suitableness to all the wants of the souls of men: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) His fitness to save, -- his being hikanos, a fit Saviour, suited
   to the work; and this, I say, is from his grace of union. The uniting
   of the natures of God and man in one person made him fit to be a
   Saviour to the uttermost. He lays his hand upon God, by partaking of
   his nature, <reference osisRef="Zech.13.7">Zechariah 13:7</reference>; and he lays his hand upon us, by being
   partaker of our nature, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:14, 16</reference>: and so becomes a days-man, or
   umpire between both. By this means he fills up all the distance that
   was made by sin between God and us; and we who were far off are made
   nigh in him. Upon this account it was that he had room enough in his
   breast to receive, and power enough in his spirit to bear, all the
   wrath that was prepared for us. Sin was infinite only in respect of the
   object; and punishment was infinite in respect of the subject. This
   arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from his union.
				</p><p>
   Union is the union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note> of the two natures of God and man in one
   person, <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.1.3">Romans 1:3</reference>, ix. 5. The necessary
   consequences of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> are, --
				</p><p>
   [1st.] The subsistence of the human nature in the person of the Son of
   God, having no subsistence of its own, <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] Koinonia idiomaton, -- that communication of attributes in the
   person, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the properties of either nature are promiscuously
   spoken of the person of Christ, under what name soever, of God or man,
   he be spoken of, <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference>, iii. 21.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] The execution of his office of mediation in his single person,
   in respect of both natures: in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> is considerable, ho energon, -- the
   agent, Christ himself, God and man. He is the principium quo,
   energetikon, -- the principle that gives life and efficacy to the whole
   work; and then, 2dly, The principium quod, -- that which operates,
   which is both natures distinctly considered. 3dly. The energeia, or
   drastike tes phuseos kinesis, -- the effectual working itself of each
   nature. And, lastly, the energema, or apotelesma, -- the effect
   produced, which arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from all, and relates to them all: so resolving
   the excellency I speak of into his personal union.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) His fulness to save, from the grace of communion or the effects
   of his union, which are free; and consequences of it, which is all the
   furniture that he received from the Father by the unction of the
   Spirit, for the work of our salvation: "He is able also to save them to
   the uttermost that come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by him," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.25">Hebrews 7:25</reference>; having all
   fulness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him: "for it pleased the Father
   that in him should all fulness dwell," <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference>; and he received not
   "the Spirit by measure," <reference osisRef="John.3.34">John 3:34</reference> And from this fulness he makes
   out a suitable supply to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all that are his; "grace for grace," <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference> Had it been given to him by measure, we had exhausted it.
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) His excellency to endear, from his complete suitableness to all
   the wants of the souls of men. There is no man whatever, that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any
   want in reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the things of God, but Christ will be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   that which he wants: I speak of those who are given him of his Father.
   Is he dead? [103] Christ is life. Is he weak? Christ is the power of
   God, and the wisdom of God. Has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he the sense of guilt upon him? Christ
   is complete righteousness, -- "The Lord our Righteousness." Many poor
   creatures are sensible of their wants, but know not where their remedy
   lies. Indeed, whether it be life or light, power or joy, all is wrapped
   up in him.
				</p><p>
   This, then, for the present, may suffice in general to be spoken of the
   personal grace of the Lord Christ:  He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a fitness to save, having
   pity and ability, tenderness and power, to carry on that work to the
   uttermost; and a fulness to save, of redemption and sanctification, of
   righteousness and the Spirit; and a suitableness to the wants of all
   our souls: through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he becomes exceedingly desirable, yea, altogether
   lovely; as afterward will appear in particular. And as to this, in the
   first place, the saints have distinct fellowship with the Lord Christ;
   the manner of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> shall be declared in the ensuing chapter.
				</p><p>
   Only, from this entrance that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been made into the description of
   him with whom the saints have communion, some motives might be taken to
   stir us up to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; as also considerations to lay open the nakedness
   and insufficiency of all other ways and things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> which men engage
   their thoughts and desires, something may be now proposed. The
   daughters of Jerusalem, ordinary, common professors, having heard the
   spouse describing her Beloved, <reference osisRef="Song.5.10-Song.5.16">Song of Solomon 5:10-16</reference>, etc., instantly are
   stirred up to seek him together with her; chap. vi. 1, "Whither is your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   Beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>." What Paul says
   of them that crucified him, may be spoken of all that reject him, or
   refuse communion with him: "Had they known him, they would not have
   crucified the Lord of glory;" -- Did men know him, were they acquainted
   in any measure with him, they would not so reject the Lord of glory.
   Himself calls them "simple ones," "fools," and "scorners," that despise
   his gracious invitation, <reference osisRef="Prov.1.22">Proverbs 1:22</reference> There are none who despise
   Christ, but only they that know him not; whose eyes the god of this
   world has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> blinded, that they should not behold his glory. The souls of
   men do naturally seek something to rest and repose themselves upon, --
   something to satiate and delight themselves withal, with which they
   [may] hold communion; and there are two ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> men proceed in the
   pursuit of what they so aim at. Some set before them some certain end,
   -- perhaps pleasure, profit, or, in religion itself, acceptance with
   God; others seek after some end, but without any certainty, pleasing
   themselves now with one path, now with another, with various thoughts
   and ways, like them, <reference osisRef="Isa.57.10">Isaiah 57:10</reference> -- because something comes in by the
   life of the hand, they give not over though weary. In what condition
   soever you may be (either in greediness pursuing some certain end, be
   it secular or religious; or wandering away in your own imaginations,
   wearying yourselves in the largeness of your ways), compare a little
   what you aim at, or what you do, with what you have already heard of
   Jesus Christ: if any thing you design be like to him, if any thing you
   desire be equal to him, let him be rejected as one that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> neither
   form nor comeliness in him; but if, indeed, all your ways be but vanity
   and vexation of spirit, in comparison of him, why do you spend your
   "money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which
   satisfies<note n="satisfieth">Auto-modernized</note> not?"
				</p><p>
   Use 1. You that are yet in the flower of your days, full of health and
   strength, and, with all the vigour of your spirits, do pursue some one
   thing, some another, consider, I pray, what are all your beloveds to
   this Beloved? What have you gotten by them? Let us see the peace,
   quietness, assurance of everlasting blessedness that they have given
   you? Their paths are crooked paths, whoever goes in them shall not know
   peace. Behold here a fit object for your choicest affections, -- one in
   whom you may find rest to your souls, -- one in whom there is nothing
   will grieve and trouble you to eternity. Behold, he stands at the door
   of your souls, and knocks: O reject him not, lest you seek him and find
   him not! Pray study him a little; you love him not, because you know
   him not. Why does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> one of you spend his time in idleness and folly, and
   wasting of precious time, perhaps debauchedly? Why does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> another
   associate and assemble himself with them that scoff at religion and the
   things of God? Merely because you know not our dear Lord Jesus. Oh,
   when he shall reveal himself to you, and tell you he is Jesus whom you
   have slighted and refused, how will it break your hearts, and make you
   mourn like a dove, that you have neglected him! and if you never come
   to know him, it had been better you had never been. While<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> it is called
   To-day, then, harden not your hearts.
				</p><p>
   Use 2. You that are, perhaps, seeking earnestly after a righteousness,
   and are religious persons, consider a little with yourselves, -- has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ his due place in your hearts? is he your all? does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he dwell in
   your thoughts? do you know him in his excellency and desirableness? do
   you indeed account all things "loss and dung" for his exceeding
   excellency? or rather, do you prefer almost any thing in the world
   before it? But more of these things afterward.

<title>Part 2 Chapter 3</title>
<p>
   Of the way and manner through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the saints hold communion with the Lord
   Christ as to personal grace -- The conjugal relation between Christ and
   the saints, <reference osisRef="Song.2.16">Song of Solomon 2:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.54.5">Isaiah 54:5</reference>, etc.; <reference osisRef="Song.3.11">Song of Solomon 3:11</reference>, opened --
   The way of communion in conjugal relation, <reference osisRef="Hos.3.3">Hosea 3:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Song.1.15">Song of Solomon 1:15</reference> --
   On the part of Christ -- On the part of the saints.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The next thing that comes under consideration is, the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   we hold communion with the Lord Christ, in respect of that personal
   grace of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we have spoken. Now, this the Scripture manifests to be
   by the way of a conjugal relation. He is married to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and we to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him; which spiritual relation is attended with suitable conjugal
   affections. And this gives us fellowship with him as to his personal
   excellencies.
				</p><p>
   This the spouse expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Song.2.16">Song of Solomon 2:16</reference>, "My Beloved is mine, and I am
   his;" -- "He is mine, I possess him, I have interest in him, as my head
   and my husband; and I am his, possessed of him, owned by him, given up
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him: and that as to my Beloved in a conjugal relation."
				</p><p>
   So <reference osisRef="Isa.54.5">Isaiah 54:5</reference>, "Your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Maker is your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> husband; the Lord of hosts is his
   name; and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole
   earth shall he be called." This is yielded as the reason why the church
   shall not be ashamed nor confounded, in the midst of her troubles and
   trials, -- she is married to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> her Maker, and her Redeemer is her
   husband. And <reference osisRef="Isa">Isaiah</reference>, setting out the mutual glory of
   Christ and his church in their walking together, he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> it is "as a
   bridegroom decks<note n="decketh">Auto-modernized</note> himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns<note n="adorneth">Auto-modernized</note>
   herself with jewels." Such is their condition, because such is their
   relation; which he also farther expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note>, chap. lxii. 5, "As the
   bridegroom rejoices<note n="rejoiceth">Auto-modernized</note> over the bride, so shall your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> God rejoice over
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>." As it is with such persons in the day of their espousals, in the
   day of the gladness of their hearts, so is it with Christ and his
   saints in this relation. He is a husband to them, providing that it may
   be with them according to the state and condition into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   taken them.
				</p><p>
   To this purpose we have his faithful engagement, <reference osisRef="Hos.2.19-Hos.2.20">Hosea 2:19-20</reference>, "I
   will," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "betroth you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me for ever; yea, I will betroth
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness,
   and in mercies. I will even betroth you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me in faithfulness." And
   it is the main design of the ministry of the gospel, to prevail with
   men to give up themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, as he reveals his
   kindness in this engagement. Hence Paul tells the Corinthians, <reference osisRef="2Cor.11.2">2 Corinthians 11:2</reference>, that he had "espoused them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one husband, that he might
   present them as a chaste virgin to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ." This he had prevailed
   upon them for, by the preaching of the gospel, that they should give up
   themselves as a virgin, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who had betrothed them to himself as a
   husband.
				</p><p>
   And this is a relation in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Jesus is exceedingly delighted,
   and invites<note n="inviteth">Auto-modernized</note> others to behold him in this his glory, <reference osisRef="Song.3.11">Song of Solomon 3:11</reference>, "Go
   forth," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "O ye daughters of Jerusalem, and behold king Solomon
   with the crown with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> his mother crowned him in the day of his
   espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart." He calls forth
   the daughters of Jerusalem (all sorts of professors) to consider him in
   the condition of betrothing and espousing his church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself.
   Moreover, he tells them that they shall find on him two things
   eminently upon this account:  1. Honour. It is the day of his
   coronation, and his spouse is the crown with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he is crowned. For as
   Christ is a diadem of beauty and a crown of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Zion, <reference osisRef="Isa.28.5">Isaiah 28:5</reference>; so Zion also is a diadem and a crown to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, <reference osisRef="Isa.62.3">Isaiah 62:3</reference>
   Christ makes this relation with his saints to be his glory and his
   honour. 2. Delight. The day of his espousals, of taking poor sinful
   souls into his bosom, is the day of the gladness of his heart. John was
   but the friend of the Bridegroom, that stood and heard his voice, when
   he was taking his bride to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself; and he rejoiced greatly, <reference osisRef="John.3.29">John 3:29</reference>: how much more, then, must be the joy and gladness of the
   Bridegroom himself! even that which is expressed, <reference osisRef="Zeph.3.17">Zephaniah 3:17</reference>, "he
   rejoices<note n="rejoiceth">Auto-modernized</note> with joy, he joys with singing."
				</p><p>
   It is the gladness of the heart of Christ, the joy of his soul, to take
   poor sinners into this relation with himself. He rejoiced in the
   thoughts of it from eternity, <reference osisRef="Prov.8.31">Proverbs 8:31</reference>; and always expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   greatest willingness to undergo the hard task required to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Ps.40.7-Ps.40.8">Psalms 40:7-8</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.10.7">Hebrews 10:7</reference>; yea, he was pained as a woman in travail, until he
   had accomplished it, <reference osisRef="Luke.12.50">Luke 12:50</reference> Because he loved his church, he gave
   himself for it, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25">Ephesians 5:25</reference>, despising the shame, and enduring the
   cross, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.2">Hebrews 12:2</reference>, that he might enjoy his bride, -- that he might be
   for her, and she for him, and not for another, <reference osisRef="Hos.3.3">Hosea 3:3</reference> This is
   joy, when he is thus crowned by his mother. It is believers that are
   mother and brother of this Solomon, <reference osisRef="Matt.12.49-Matt.12.50">Matthew 12:49-50</reference> They crown him
   in the day of his espousals, giving themselves to him, and becoming his
   glory, <reference osisRef="2Cor.8.23">2 Corinthians 8:23</reference>
				</p><p>
   Thus he sets out his whole communion with his church under this
   allusion, and that most frequently. The time of his taking the church
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself is the day of his marriage; and the church is his bride,
   his wife, <reference osisRef="Rev.19.7-Rev.19.8">Revelation of John 19:7-8</reference> The entertainment he makes for his saints is
   a wedding supper, <reference osisRef="Matt.22.3">Matthew 22:3</reference> The graces of his church are the
   ornaments of his queen, <reference osisRef="Ps.45.9-Ps.45.14">Psalms 45:9-14</reference>; and the fellowship he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> with
   his saints is as that which those who are mutually beloved in a
   conjugal relation do hold, Cant. i. Hence Paul, in describing these
   two, makes sudden and insensible transitions from one to the other, --
   Eph. v., from verse 22 to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> verse 32; concluding the whole with an
   application to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ and the church.
				</p><p>
   It is now to be inquired, in the next place, how it is that we hold
   communion with the person of Christ in respect of conjugal relations
   and affections, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist. Now, in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> there are
   some things that are common to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ and the saints, and some things
   that are peculiar to each of them, as the nature of this relation does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   require. The whole may be reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these two heads:  [1.] A mutual
   resignation of themselves one to the other; [2.] Mutual, consequential,
   conjugal affections.
				</p><p>
   [1.] There is a mutual resignation, or making over of their persons one
   to another. This is the first act of communion, as to the personal
   grace of Christ. Christ makes himself over to the soul, to be his, as
   to all the love, care, and tenderness of a husband; and the soul gives
   up itself wholly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, to be his, as to all loving,
   tender obedience. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is the main of Christ's and the saints'
   espousals. This, in the prophet, is set out under a parable of himself
   and a harlot, <reference osisRef="Hos.3.3">Hosea 3:3</reference>, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt abide for me," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   her, "you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt not be for another, and I will be for you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>." -- "Poor
   harlot," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, "I have bought you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> myself with
   the price of mine own blood; and now, this is that which we will
   consent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, -- I will be for you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, and you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt be for me, and not
   for another.
				</p><p>
   1st. Christ gives himself to the soul, with all his excellencies,
   righteousness, preciousness, graces, and eminencies, to be its Saviour,
   head, and husband, for ever to dwell with it in this holy relation. He
   looks upon the souls of his saints, likes them well, counts them fair
   and beautiful, because he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made them so. <reference osisRef="Song.1.15">Song of Solomon 1:15</reference>, "Behold, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note>
   are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> fair, my companion; behold, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> fair; you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> doves' eyes."
   Let others think what they please, Christ redoubles it, that the souls
   of his saints are very beautiful, even perfect, through his comeliness,
   which he puts upon them, <reference osisRef="Ezek.16.14">Ezekiel 16:14</reference>, -- "Behold, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> fair, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note>
   are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> fair:" [104] particularly, that their spiritual light is very
   excellent and glorious; like the eyes of a dove, tender, discerning,
   clear, and shining. Therefore he adds that pathetical wish of the
   enjoyment of this his spouse, <reference osisRef="Song.2.14">Song of Solomon 2:14</reference>, "O my dove," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he,
   "that are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the
   stairs, let me see your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> countenance, let me hear your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> voice; for sweet is
   your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> voice, and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> countenance is comely;" -- "Do not hide yourself<note n="thyself">Auto-modernized</note>, as
   one that flies to the clefts of the rocks; be not dejected, as one that
   hides herself behind the stairs, and is afraid to come forth to the
   company that inquires for her. Let not your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> spirit be cast down at the
   weakness of your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> supplications, let me yet hear your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> sighs and groans,
   your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> breathing and partings to me; they are very sweet, very delightful:
   and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> spiritual countenance, your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> appearance in heavenly things, is
   comely and delightful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me." Neither does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he leave her thus, but,
   chap. iv. 8, presses<note n="presseth">Auto-modernized</note> her hard to a closer [union] with him in this
   conjugal bond: "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from
   Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Herman,
   from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards;" -- "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note>
   in a wandering condition (as the Israelites of old), among lions and
   leopards, sins and troubles; come from thence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me, and I will give
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> refreshment," <reference osisRef="Matt.11.28">Matthew 11:28</reference> Upon this invitation, the spouse
   boldly concludes, <reference osisRef="Song.7.10">Song of Solomon 7:10</reference>, that the desire of Christ is towards
   her; that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> indeed love her, and aim at taking her into this
   fellowship with himself. So, in carrying on this union, Christ freely
   bestows<note n="bestoweth">Auto-modernized</note> himself upon the soul. Precious and excellent as he is, he
   becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> ours. He makes himself to be so; and with him, all his graces.
   Hence says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the spouse, "?My Beloved is mine;' in all that he is, he is
   mine." Because he is righteousness, [105] he is "The Lord our
   Righteousness," <reference osisRef="Jer.23.6">Jeremiah 23:6</reference> Because he is the wisdom of God, and the
   power of God, he is "made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us wisdom," etc., <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference> Thus,
   "the branch of the Lord is beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the
   earth is excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel,"
   <reference osisRef="Isa.4.2">Isaiah 4:2</reference> This is the first thing on the part of Christ, -- the free
   donation and bestowing of himself upon us to be our Christ, our
   Beloved, as to all the ends and purposes of love, mercy, grace, and
   glory; to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> in his mediation he is designed, in a marriage
   covenant never to be broken. This is the sum of what is intended:  The
   Lord Jesus Christ, fitted and prepared, by the accomplishment and
   furniture of his person as mediator, and the large purchase of grace
   and glory which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made, to be a husband to his saints, his
   church, tenders himself in the promises of the gospel to them in all
   his desirableness; convinces them of his good-will towards them, and
   his all-sufficiency for a supply of their wants; and upon their consent
   to accept of him, -- which is all he requires or expects at their
   hands, -- he engages<note n="engageth">Auto-modernized</note> himself in a marriage covenant to be theirs for
   ever.
				</p><p>
   2dly. On the part of the saints, it is their free, willing consent to
   receive, embrace, and submit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Jesus, as their husband,
   Lord, and Saviour, -- to abide with him, subject their souls to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him,
   and to be ruled by him for ever.
				</p><p>
   Now, this in the soul is either initial, or the solemn consent at the
   first entrance of union; or consequential, in renewed acts of consent
   all our days. I speak of it especially in this latter sense, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it
   is proper to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> communion; not in the former, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it primarily
   intends<note n="intendeth">Auto-modernized</note> union.
				</p><p>
   There are two things that complete this self-resignation of the soul: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The liking of Christ, for his excellency, grace, and
   suitableness, far above all other beloveds whatever, preferring him in
   the judgment and mind above them all. In the place above mentioned,
   <reference osisRef="Song.5.9">Song of Solomon 5:9</reference>, the spouse being earnestly pressed, by professors at large,
   to give in her thoughts concerning the excellency of her Beloved in
   comparison of other endearments, answers<note n="answereth">Auto-modernized</note> expressly, that he is "the
   chiefest of ten thousand, yea," verse 16, "altogether lovely," --
   infinitely beyond comparison with the choicest created good or
   endearment imaginable. The soul takes a view of all that is in this
   world, "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
   life," and sees it all to be vanity, -- that "the world passes<note n="passeth">Auto-modernized</note> away,
   and the lust of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="1John.2.16-1John.2.17">1 John 2:16-17</reference> These beloveds are no way to
   be compared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. It views also legal righteousness, blamelessness
   before men, uprightness of conversation, duties upon conviction, and
   concludes of all as Paul does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8">Philippians 3:8</reference>, "Doubtless, I count all
   these things loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus
   my Lord." So, also, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the church, <reference osisRef="Hos.14.3">Hosea 14:3</reference>, reject all appearing
   assistances whatever, -- as goodly as Asshur, as promising as idols, --
   that God alone may be preferred. And this is the soul's entrance into
   conjugal communion with Jesus Christ as to personal grace, -- the
   constant preferring him above all pretenders to its affections,
   counting all loss and dung in comparison of him. Beloved peace, beloved
   natural relations, beloved wisdom and learning, beloved righteousness,
   beloved duties, [are] all loss, compared with Christ.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) The accepting of Christ by the will, as its only husband, Lord,
   and Saviour. This is called "receiving" of Christ, <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference>; and is
   not intended only for that solemn act through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> at first entrance we
   close with him, but also for the constant frame of the soul in abiding
   with him and owning of him as such. When the soul consents to take
   Christ on his own terms, to save him in his own way, [106] and says,
   "Lord, I would have had you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> and salvation in my way, that it might
   have been partly of mine endeavours, and as it were by the works of the
   law; I am now willing to receive you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> and to be saved in your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> way, --
   merely by grace: and though I would have walked according to my own
   mind, yet now I wholly give up myself to be ruled by your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Spirit: for in
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> have I righteousness and strength, [107] in you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> am I justified
   and do glory;" -- then does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it carry on communion with Christ as to the
   grace of his person. This it is to receive the Lord Jesus in his
   comeliness and eminency. Let believers exercise their hearts abundantly
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this thing. This is choice communion with the Son Jesus Christ.
   Let us receive him in all his excellencies, as he bestows himself upon
   us; -- be frequent in thoughts of faith, comparing him with other
   beloveds, sin, world, legal righteousness; and preferring him before
   them, counting them all loss and dung in comparison of him. And let our
   souls be persuaded of his sincerity and willingness in giving himself,
   in all that he is, as mediator to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, to be ours; and let our hearts
   give up themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Let us tell him that we will be for him,
   and not for another: let him know it from us; he delights to hear it,
   yea, he says, "Sweet is our voice, and our countenance is comely;" --
   and we shall not fail in the issue of sweet refreshment with him.
</p>

<title>Digression I.</title>
<p>   Some excellencies of Christ proposed to consideration, to endear our
   hearts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- His description, Cant. v., opened.
				</p><p>
   To strengthen our hearts in the resignation mentioned of ourselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the Lord Christ as our husband, as also to make way for the stirring of
   us up to those consequential conjugal affections of which mention shall
   afterward be made, I shall turn aside to a more full description of
   some of the personal excellencies of the Lord Christ, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the
   hearts of his saints are indeed endeared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   In "The Lord our Righteousness," then, may these ensuing things be
   considered; which are exceeding suitable to prevail upon our hearts to
   give up themselves to be wholly his: 
				</p><p>
   1. He is exceeding excellent and desirable in his [108] Deity, and the
   glory of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. He is "Jehovah our Righteousness," <reference osisRef="Jer.23.6">Jeremiah 23:6</reference> In the
   rejoicing of Zion at his coming to her, this is the bottom, "Behold your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   God!" <reference osisRef="Isa.40.9">Isaiah 40:9</reference> "We have seen his glory," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle. What
   glory is that? "The glory of the only-begotten Son of God," <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>
   The choicest saints have been afraid and amazed at the beauty of an
   angel; and the stoutest sinners have trembled at the glory of one of
   those creatures in a low appearance, representing but the back parts of
   their glory, who yet themselves, in their highest advancement, do cover
   their faces at the presence of our Beloved, as conscious to themselves
   of their utter disability to bear the rays of his glory, <reference osisRef="Isa.6.2">Isaiah 6:2</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="John.12.39-John.12.41">John 12:39-41</reference> He is "the fellow of the Lord of hosts," <reference osisRef="Zech.13.7">Zechariah 13:7</reference> And though he once appeared in the form of a servant, yet then "he
   thought it not robbery to be equal with God," <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6">Philippians 2:6</reference> In the glory
   of this majesty he dwells in light inaccessible. We "cannot by
   searching find out the Almighty to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfection: it is as high as
   heaven; what can we do? deeper than hell; what can we know? the measure
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea," <reference osisRef="Job.11.7-Job.11.9">Job 11:7-9</reference> We may all say one to another of this, "Surely we are more brutish
   than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. We neither
   learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. Who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ascended
   up into heaven, or descended? who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> gathered the wind in his fists?
   who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> bound the waters in a garment? who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> established all the
   ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his Son's name, if ye
   can tell," <reference osisRef="Prov.30.2-Prov.30.4">Proverbs 30:2-4</reference>
				</p><p>
   If any one should ask, now, with them in the Canticles, what is in the
   Lord Jesus, our beloved, more than in other beloveds, that should make
   him so desirable, and amiable, and worthy of acceptation? what is he
   more than others? I ask, What is a king more than a beggar? Much every
   way. Alas! this is nothing; they were born alike, must die alike, and
   after that is the judgment. What is an angel more than a worm? A worm
   is a creature, and an angel is no more; he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made the one to creep
   in the earth, -- made also the other to dwell in heaven. There is still
   a proportion between these, they agree in something; but what are all
   the nothings of the world to the God infinitely blessed for evermore?
   Shall the dust of the balance, or the drop of the bucket be laid in the
   scale against him? This is he of whom the sinners in Zion are afraid,
   and cry, "Who amongst us shall dwell with the devouring fire, who
   amongst us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" I might now give you
   a glimpse of his excellency in many of those properties and attributes
   by which he discovers himself to the faith of poor sinners; but as he
   that goes into a garden where there are innumerable flowers in great
   variety, gathers not all he sees, but crops here and there one, and
   another, I shall endeavour to open a door, and give an inlet into the
   infinite excellency of the graces of the Lord Jesus, as he is "God
   blessed for evermore," -- presenting the reader with one or two
   instances, leaving him to gather for his own use what farther he
   pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>. Hence, then, observe, --
				</p><p>
   The endless, bottomless, boundless grace and compassion that is in him
   who is thus our husband, as he is the God of Zion. It is not the grace
   of a creature, nor all the grace that can possibly at once dwell in a
   created nature, that will serve our turn. We are too indigent to be
   suited with such a supply. There was a fulness of grace in the human
   nature of Christ, -- he received not "the Spirit by measure," <reference osisRef="John.3.34">John 3:34</reference>; a fulness like that of light in the sun, or of water in the sea (I
   speak not in respect of communication, but sufficiency); a fulness
   incomparably above the measure of angels: yet it was not properly an
   infinite fulness, -- it was a created, and therefore a limited fulness.
   If it could be conceived as separated from the Deity, surely so many
   thirsty, guilty souls, as every day drink deep and large draughts of
   grace and mercy from him, would (if I may so speak) sink him to the
   very bottom; nay, it could afford no supply at all, but only in a moral
   way. But when the conduit of his humanity is inseparably united to the
   infinite, inexhaustible fountain of the Deity, who can look into the
   depths of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>? If, now, there be grace enough for sinners in an
   all-sufficient God, it is in Christ; and, indeed, in any other there
   cannot be enough. The Lord gives this reason for the peace and
   confidence of sinners, <reference osisRef="Isa.54.4-Isa.54.5">Isaiah 54:4-5</reference>, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt not be ashamed,
   neither be you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> confounded; for you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt not be put to shame." But
   how shall this be? So much sin, and not ashamed! so much guilt, and not
   confounded! "Your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Maker," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "is your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> husband; the Lord of hosts
   is his name; and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the
   whole earth shall he be called." This is the bottom of all peace,
   confidence, and consolation, -- the grace and mercy of our Maker, of
   the God of the whole earth. So are kindness and power tempered in him;
   he makes us, and mars us, -- he is our God and our Goel, our Redeemer.
   "Look to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "and be ye saved; for I am God, and none
   else," <reference osisRef="Isa.45.22">Isaiah 45:22</reference>, "Surely, shall one say, In the Lord have I
   righteousness," verse 24.
				</p><p>
   And on this ground it is that if all the world should (if I may so say)
   set themselves to drink free grace, mercy, and pardon, drawing [109]
   water continually from the wells of salvation; if they should set
   themselves to draw from one single promise, an angel standing by and
   crying, "Drink, O my friends, yea, drink abundantly, take so much grace
   and pardon as shall be abundantly sufficient for the world of sin which
   is in every one of you;" -- they would not be able to sink the grace of
   the promise one hair's breadth. There is enough for millions of worlds,
   if they were; because it flows into it from an infinite, bottomless
   fountain. "Fear not, O worm Jacob, I am God, and not man," is the
   bottom of sinners' consolation. This is that "head of gold" mentioned,
   <reference osisRef="Song.5.11">Song of Solomon 5:11</reference>, that most precious fountain of grace and mercy. This
   infiniteness of grace, in respect of its spring and fountain, will
   answer all objections that might hinder our souls from drawing nigh to
   communion with him, and from a free embracing of him. Will not this
   suit us in all our distresses? What is our finite guilt before it? Show
   me the sinner that can spread his iniquities to the dimensions (if I
   may so say) of this grace. Here is mercy enough for the greatest, the
   oldest, the stubbornest transgressor, -- "Why will ye die, O house of
   Israel?" Take heed of them who would rob you of the Deity of Christ. If
   there were no more grace for me than what can be treasured up in a mere
   man, I should rejoice [if] my portion might be under rocks and
   mountains.
				</p><p>
   Consider, hence, his eternal, free, unchangeable love. Were the love of
   Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us but the love of a mere man, though never so excellent,
   innocent, and glorious, it must have a beginning, it must have an
   ending, and perhaps be fruitless. The love of Christ in his human
   nature towards his is exceeding, intense, tender, precious,
   compassionate, abundantly heightened by a sense of our miseries,
   feeling of our wants, experience of our temptations; all flowing from
   that rich stock of grace, pity, and compassion, which, on purpose for
   our good and supply, was bestowed on him: but yet this love, as such,
   cannot be infinite nor eternal, nor from itself absolutely
   unchangeable. Were it no more, though not to be paralleled nor
   fathomed, yet our Saviour could not say of it, as he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, "As the
   Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> loved me, so have I loved you," <reference osisRef="John.15.9">John 15:9</reference> His love could
   not be compared with and equalled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine love of the Father,
   in those properties of eternity, fruitfulness, and unchangeableness,
   which are the chief anchors of the soul, rolling itself on the bosom of
   Christ. But now, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) It is eternal: "Come ye near to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me, hear ye this; I have not,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it
   was, there am I: and now the Lord God, and his Spirit, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent me,"
   <reference osisRef="Isa.48.16">Isaiah 48:16</reference> He himself is "yesterday, today, and for ever," <reference osisRef="Heb.13.8">Hebrews 13:8</reference>; and so is his love, being his who is "Alpha and Omega, the
   first and the last, the beginning and the ending, which is, which was,
   and which is to come," <reference osisRef="Rev.1.11">Revelation of John 1:11</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) Unchangeable. Our love is like ourselves; as we are, so are all
   our affections: so is the love of Christ like himself. We love one, one
   day, and hate him the next. He changes<note n="changeth">Auto-modernized</note>, and we change also: this day
   he is our right hand, our right eye; the next day, "Cut him off, pluck
   him out." [110] Jesus Christ is still the same; and so is his love. "In
   the beginning he laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are
   the works of his hands; they shall perish, but he remains<note n="remaineth">Auto-modernized</note>: they all
   shall wax old as does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> a garment; and as a vesture shall he fold them
   up, and they shall be changed: but he is the same, and his years fail
   not," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.10-Heb.1.12">Hebrews 1:10-12</reference> He is the Lord, and he changes<note n="changeth">Auto-modernized</note> not; and therefore
   we are not consumed. Whom he loves, he loves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end. [111] His
   love is such as never had beginning, and never shall have ending.
				</p><p>
   (3.) It is also fruitful, -- fruitful in all gracious issues and
   effects. A man may love another as his own soul, yet perhaps that love
   of his cannot help him. He may thereby pity him in prison, but not
   relieve him; bemoan him in misery, but not help him; suffer with him in
   trouble, but not ease him. We cannot love grace into a child, nor mercy
   into a friend; we cannot love them into heaven, though it may be the
   great desire of our soul. It was love that made Abraham cry, "O that
   Ishmael might live before you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>!" but it might not be. But now the love
   of Christ, being the love of God, is effectual and fruitful in
   producing all the good things which he wills<note n="willeth">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his beloved. He
   loves life, grace, and holiness into us; he loves us also into
   covenant, loves us into heaven. Love in him is properly to will good to
   any one: whatever good Christ by his love wills to any, that willing is
   operative of that good.
				</p><p>
   These three qualifications of the love of Christ make it exceedingly
   eminent, and him exceeding desirable. How many millions of sins, in
   every one of the elect, every one of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> were enough to condemn them
   all, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> this love overcome! what mountains of unbelief does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it
   remove! Look upon the conversation of any one saint, consider the frame
   of his heart, see the many stains and spots, the defilements and
   infirmities, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> his life is contaminated, and tell me whether
   the love that bears with all this be not to be admired. And is it not
   the same towards thousands every day? What streams of grace, purging,
   pardoning, quickening, assisting, do flow from it every day! This is
   our Beloved, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.
				</p><p>
   2. He is desirable and worthy our acceptation, as considered in his
   humanity; even in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> also, in reference to us, he is exceedingly
   desirable. I shall only, in this, note to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you two things:  (1.) Its
   freedom from sin; (2.) Its fulness of grace; -- in both which regards
   the Scripture sets him out as exceedingly lovely and amiable.
				</p><p>
   (1.) He was free from sin; -- the [112] Lamb of God, without spot, and
   without blemish; the male of the flock, to be offered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, the
   curse falling on all other oblations, and them that offer them, <reference osisRef="Mal.1.14">Malachi 1:14</reference> The purity of the snow is not to be compared with the whiteness of
   this lily, of this [113] rose of Sharon, even from the womb: "For such
   an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
   from sinners," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26">Hebrews 7:26</reference> Sanctified persons, whose stains are in
   any measure washed away, are exceeding fair in the eye of Christ
   himself. "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> [114] are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> all fair," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "my love, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> no
   spot in you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>." How fair, then, is he who never had the least spot or
   stain!
				</p><p>
   It is true, Adam at his creation had this spotless purity; so had the
   angels: but they came immediately from the [115] hand of God, without
   concurrence of any secondary cause. Jesus Christ [116] is a plant and
   root out of a dry ground, a blossom from the stem of Jesse, a bud from
   the loins of sinful man, -- born of a sinner, after there had been no
   innocent flesh in the world for four thousand years, every one upon the
   roll of his genealogy being infected with that<note n="therewithal">Auto-modernized</note>. To have a flower of
   wonderful rarity to grow in paradise, a garden of God's own planting,
   not sullied in the least, is not so strange; but, as the psalmist
   speaks (in another kind), to hear of it in a wood, to find it in a
   forest, to have a spotless bud brought forth in the wilderness of
   corrupted nature, is a thing which angels may desire to look into. Nay,
   more, this whole nature was not only defiled, but also accursed; not
   only unclean, but also guilty, -- guilty of Adam's transgression, in
   whom we have all sinned. That the human nature of Christ should be
   derived from hence free from guilt, free from pollution, this is to be
   adored.
				</p><p>
   Objection. But you will say, "How can this be? who can bring a clean
   thing from an unclean? How could Christ take our nature, and not the
   defilements of it, and the guilt of it? If [117] Levi paid tithes in
   the loins of Abraham, how is it that Christ did not sin in the loins of
   Adam?"
				</p><p>
   Answer. There are two things in original sin: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] Guilt of the first sin, which is imputed to us. We all sinned in
   him. Eph' ho pantes hemarton, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.12">Romans 5:12</reference>, whether we render it
   relatively "in whom," or illatively, "being all have sinned," all is
   one: that one sin is the sin of us all, -- "omnes eramus unus ille
   homo." We were all in covenant with him; he was not only a natural
   head, but also a federal head to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. As Christ is to believers, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.17">Romans 5:17</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.22">1 Corinthians 15:22</reference>, so was he to us all; and his transgression of
   that covenant is reckoned to us.
				</p><p>
   [2.] There is the derivation of a polluted, corrupted nature from him:
   [118] "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?" "That which is
   born of the flesh is flesh," and nothing else; whose wisdom and mind is
   corrupted also: a polluted fountain will have polluted streams. The
   first person corrupted nature, and that nature corrupts all persons
   following. Now, from both these was Christ most free: 
				</p><p>
   1st. He was never federally in Adam, and so not liable to the
   imputation of his sin on that account. It is true that sin was imputed
   to him when he was made sin; [119] thereby he took away the sin of the
   world, <reference osisRef="John.1.29">John 1:29</reference>: but it was imputed to him in the covenant of the
   Mediator, through his voluntary susception, and not in the covenant of
   Adam, by a legal imputation. Had it been reckoned to him as a
   descendant from Adam, he had not been a fit high priest to have offered
   sacrifices for us, as not being "separate from sinners," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26">Hebrews 7:26</reference>
   Had Adam stood in his innocence, Christ had not been incarnate, to have
   been a mediator for sinners; and therefore the counsel of his
   incarnation, morally, took not place [120] until after the fall. Though
   he was in Adam in a natural sense from his first creation, in respect
   of the purpose of God, <reference osisRef="Luke.3.23 Luke.3.38">Luke 3:23, 38</reference>, yet he was not in him in a law
   sense until after the fall: so that, as to his own person, he had no
   more to do with the first sin of Adam, than with any personal sin of
   [any] one whose punishment he voluntarily took upon him; as we are not
   liable to the guilt of those progenitors who followed Adam, though
   naturally we were no less in them than in him. Therefore did he, all
   the days of his flesh, serve God in a covenant of works; and was
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> accepted with him, having done nothing that should disannul the
   virtue of that covenant as to him. This does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not, then, in the least
   take off from his perfection.
				</p><p>
   2dly. For the pollution of our nature, it was prevented in him from the
   instant of conception, <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference>, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>: therefore
   also that holy thing that shall be born of you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> shall be called the Son
   of God." He was "made of a woman," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference>; but that portion of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   he was made was sanctified by the Holy Ghost, that what was born
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> should be a holy thing. Not only the union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note> and union of
   soul and body, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> a man becomes partaker of his whole nature, and
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> of the pollution of sin, being a son of Adam, was prevented by
   the sanctification of the Holy Ghost, but it also accompanied the very
   separation of his bodily substance in the womb to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that sacred purpose
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> it was set apart: so that upon all accounts he is "holy,
   harmless, undefiled." Add now to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, that he "did no sin, neither
   was guile found in his mouth," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.22">1 Peter 2:22</reference>; that he "fulfilled all
   righteousness," <reference osisRef="Matt.3.15">Matthew 3:15</reference>; his Father being always "well pleased"
   with him, verse 17, on the account of his perfect obedience; yea, even
   in that sense in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he charges<note n="chargeth">Auto-modernized</note> his angels with folly, and those
   inhabitants of heaven are not clean in his sight; and his excellency
   and desirableness in this regard will lie before us. Such was he, such
   is he; and yet for our sakes was he contented not only to be esteemed
   by the vilest of men to be a transgressor, but to undergo from God the
   punishment due to the vilest sinners. Of which afterward.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The fulness of grace in Christ's human nature sets forth the
   amiableness and desirableness of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Should I make it my business to
   consider his perfections, as to this part of his excellency, -- what he
   had from the womb, <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference>, what received growth and improvement as
   to exercise in the days of his flesh, <reference osisRef="Luke.2.52">Luke 2:52</reference>, with the complement
   of them all in glory, -- the whole would tend to the purpose in hand. I
   am but taking a view of these things in transitu. These two things lie
   in open sight to all at the first consideration:  all grace was in
   him, for the kinds of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; and all degrees of grace, for its
   perfections; and both of them make up that fulness that was in him. It
   is created grace that I intend; and therefore I speak of the kinds of
   it: it is grace inherent in a created nature, not infinite; and
   therefore I speak of the degrees of it.
				</p><p>
   For the fountain of grace, the Holy Ghost, he received not him "by
   measure," <reference osisRef="John.3.34">John 3:34</reference>; and for the communications of the Spirit, "it
   pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell," <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference>,
   -- "that in all things he might have the pre-eminence." But these
   things are commonly spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   This is the Beloved of our souls, "holy, harmless, undefiled;" "full of
   grace and truth;" -- [121] full, to a sufficiency for every end of
   grace, -- full, for practice, to be an example to men and angels as to
   obedience, -- full, to a certainty of uninterrupted communion with God,
   -- full, to a readiness of giving supply to others, -- full, to suit
   him to all the occasions and necessities of the souls of men, -- full,
   to a glory not unbecoming a subsistence in the person of the Son of
   God, -- full, to a perfect victory, in trials, over all temptations, --
   full, to an exact correspondence to the whole law, every righteous and
   holy law of God, -- full to the utmost capacity of a limited, created,
   finite nature, -- full, to the greatest beauty and glory of a living
   temple of God, -- full, to the full pleasure and delight of the soul of
   his Father, -- full to an everlasting monument of the glory of God, in
   giving such inconceivable excellencies to the Son of man.
				</p><p>
   And this is the second thing considerable for the endearing of our
   souls to our Beloved.
				</p><p>
   3. Consider that he is all this in one person. We have not been
   treating of two, a God and a man; but of [122] one who is God and man.
   That Word that was with God in the beginning, and was God, <reference osisRef="John.1.1">John 1:1</reference>,
   is also made flesh, verse 14; -- not by a conversion of itself into
   flesh; not by appearing in the outward shape and likeness of flesh; but
   by assuming that holy thing that was born of the virgin, <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference>,
   into personal union with himself. So "The mighty God," <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>, is a
   "child given" to us; that holy thing that was born of the virgin is
   called "The Son of God," <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference> That which made the man Christ
   Jesus to be a man, was the union of soul and body; that which made him
   that man, and without which he was not the man, was the subsistence of
   both united in the person of the Son of God. As to the proof of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, I
   have spoken of it [123] elsewhere at large; I now propose it only in
   general, to show the amiableness of Christ on this account. Here lies,
   hence arises, the grace, peace, life, and security of the church, -- of
   all believers; as by some few considerations may be clearly evinced: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) Hence was he fit [124] to suffer and able to bear whatever was due
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, in that very action in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the "Son of man gave his life a
   ransom for many," <reference osisRef="Matt.20.28">Matthew 20:28</reference> "God redeemed his church with his own
   blood," <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference>; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> was the "love of God seen, that he
   gave his life for us," <reference osisRef="1John.3.16">1 John 3:16</reference> On this account was there room,
   enough in his breast to receive the points of all the [125] swords that
   were sharpened by the law against us; and strength enough in his
   shoulders to bear the burden of that curse that was due to us. Thence
   was he so willing to undertake the work of our redemption, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.7-Heb.10.8">Hebrews 10:7-8</reference>, "Lo, I come to do your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> will, O God," -- because he knew his ability
   to go through with it. Had he not been man, he could not have suffered;
   -- had he not been God, his suffering could not have availed either
   himself or us, -- he had not satisfied; the suffering of a mere man
   could not bear any proportion to that which in any respect was
   infinite. Had the great and righteous God gathered together all the
   sins that had been committed by his elect from the foundation of the
   world, and searched the bosoms of all that were to come to the end of
   the world, and taken them all, from the sin of their nature to the
   least deviation from the rectitude of his most holy law, and the
   highest provocation of their regenerate and unregenerate condition, and
   laid them on a mere holy, innocent, creature; -- O how would they have
   overwhelmed him, and buried him for ever out of the presence of God's
   love! Therefore does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle premise that glorious description of
   him to the purging of our sin: "He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by his Son, whom
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
   who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
   person, and upholding all things by the word of his power," has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   "purged our sins." <reference osisRef="Heb.1.2-Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:2-3</reference> It was he that purged our sins, who
   was the Son and heir of all things, by whom the world was made, -- the
   brightness of his Father's glory, and express image of his person; he
   did it, he alone was able to do it. "God was manifested in the flesh,"
   <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>, for this work. The sword awaked against him that was
   the fellow of the Lord of hosts, <reference osisRef="Zech.13.7">Zechariah 13:7</reference>; and by the wounds of
   that great shepherd are the sheep healed, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.24-1Pet.2.25">1 Peter 2:24-25</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) Hence does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he become an endless, bottomless fountain of grace to
   all them that believe. The fulness that it pleased the Father to commit
   to Christ, to be the great treasury and storehouse of the church, did
   not, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not, lie in the human nature, considered in itself; but in
   the person of the mediator, God and man. Consider in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> his
   communication of grace does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist, and this will be evident. The
   foundation of all is laid in his satisfaction, merit, and purchase;
   these are the morally procuring cause of all the grace we receive from
   Christ. Hence all grace becomes to be his; [126] all the things of the
   new covenant, the promises of God, all the mercy, love, grace, glory
   promised, became, I say, to be his. Not as though they were all
   actually invested, or did reside and were in the human nature, and were
   from thence really communicated to us by a participation of a portion
   of what did so inhere: but they are morally his, by a [127] compact, to
   be bestowed by him as he thinks good, as he is mediator, God and man;
   that is, the only begotten Son made flesh, <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>, "from whose
   fulness we receive, and grace for grace." The real communication of
   grace is by Christ sending the Holy Ghost to regenerate us, and to
   create all the habitual grace, with the daily supplies of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, in our
   hearts, that we are made partakers of. Now the Holy Ghost is thus sent
   by Christ as mediator, God and man, as is at large declared, John xiv.,
   xv., xvi.; of which more afterward. This, then, is that which I intend
   by this fulness of grace that is in Christ, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> we have both
   our beginning and all our supplies; which makes him, as he is the Alpha
   and Omega of his church, the beginner and finisher of our faith,
   excellent and desirable to our souls: [128] -- Upon the payment of the
   great price of his blood, and full acquitment on the satisfaction he
   made, all grace whatever (of which at large afterward) becomes, in a
   moral sense, his, at his disposal; and he bestows it on, or works it
   in, the hearts of his by the Holy Ghost, according as, in his infinite
   wisdom, he sees it needful. How glorious is he to the soul on this
   consideration! That is most excellent to us which suits us in a wanting
   condition, -- that which gives bread to the hungry, water to the
   thirsty, mercy to the perishing. All our reliefs are thus in our
   Beloved. Here is the life of our souls, the joy of our hearts, our
   relief against sin and deliverance from the wrath to come.
				</p><p>
   (3.) Thus is he fitted for a mediator, a days-man, an umpire between
   God and us, -- being one with him, and one with us, and one in himself
   in this oneness, in the unity of one person. His ability and universal
   fitness for his office of mediator are hence usually demonstrated. And
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is he "Christ, [129] the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> shines out the infinitely glorious wisdom of God; which we may
   better admire than express. What soul that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any acquaintance with
   these things falls not down with reverence and astonishment? How
   glorious is he that is the Beloved of our souls! What can be wanting
   that should encourage us to take up our rest and peace in his bosom?
   Unless all ways of relief and refreshment be so obstructed by unbelief,
   that no consideration can reach the heart to yield it the least
   assistance, it is impossible but that from hence the soul may gather
   that which will endear it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him with whom we have to do. Let us
   dwell on the thoughts of it. This is the hidden mystery; great without
   controversy; admirable to eternity. What poor, low, perishing things do
   we spend our contemplations on! Were we to have no advantage by this
   astonishing dispensation, yet its excellency, glory, beauty, depths,
   deserve the flower of our inquiries, the vigour of our spirits, the
   substance of our time; but when, withal, our life, our peace, our joy,
   our inheritance, our eternity, our all, lies in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, shall not the
   thoughts of it always dwell in our hearts, always refresh and delight
   our souls?
				</p><p>
   (4.) He is excellent and glorious in this, -- in that he is exalted and
   invested with all authority. When [130] Jacob heard of the exaltation
   of his son Joseph in Egypt, and saw the chariots that he had sent for
   him, his spirit fainted and recovered again, through abundance of joy
   and other overflowing affections. Is our Beloved lost, who for our
   sakes was upon the earth poor and persecuted, reviled, killed? No! he
   was dead, but he is alive, and, lo, he lives for ever and ever, and
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the keys of hell and of death. [131] Our Beloved is made a lord
   and ruler, <reference osisRef="Acts.2.36">Acts 2:36</reference> He is made a king; God sets him his king on his
   holy hill of Zion, <reference osisRef="Ps.2.6">Psalms 2:6</reference>; [132] and he is crowned with honour and
   dignity, after he had been "made a little lower than the angels for the
   suffering of death," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.7-Heb.2.9">Hebrews 2:7-9</reference> And what is he made king of? "All
   things are put in subjection under his feet," verse 8. And what power
   over them has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> our Beloved? "All power in heaven and earth," <reference osisRef="Matt.28.18">Matthew 28:18</reference> As for men, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> power given him "over all flesh," <reference osisRef="John.17.2">John 17:2</reference> And in what glory does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he exercise this power? He gives
   eternal life to his elect; ruling them in the power of God, <reference osisRef="Mic.5.4">Micah 5:4</reference>,
   until he bring them to himself: and for his enemies, his arrows are
   sharp in their hearts, <reference osisRef="Ps.45.5">Psalms 45:5</reference>; he dips his vesture in their blood.
   [133] Oh, how glorious is he in his authority over his enemies! In this
   world he terrifies, frightens, awes, convinces, bruises their hearts
   and consciences, -- fills them with fear, terror, disquiet<note n="disquietment">Auto-modernized</note>, until
   they yield him feigned obedience; and sometimes with outward judgments
   bruises, breaks, turns the wheel upon them, -- stains all his vesture
   with their blood, -- fills the earth with their carcases: and at last
   will gather them all together, beast, false prophet, nations, etc., and
   cast them into that lake that burns with fire and brimstone. [134]
				</p><p>
   He is gloriously exalted above angels in this his authority, good and
   bad, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.20-Eph.1.22">Ephesians 1:20-22</reference>, "far above all principality, and power, and might,
   and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
   also in that which is to come." They are all under his feet, -- at his
   command and absolute disposal. He is at the right hand of God, in the
   highest exaltation possible, and in full possession of a kingdom over
   the whole creation; having received a "name above every name," etc.,
   <reference osisRef="Phil.2.9">Philippians 2:9</reference> Thus is he glorious in his throne, which is at "the right
   hand of the [135] Majesty on high;" glorious in his commission, which
   is "all power in heaven and earth;" glorious in his name, a name above
   every name, -- "Lord of lords, and King of kings;" glorious in his
   sceptre, -- "a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of his kingdom;"
   glorious in his attendants, -- "his chariots are twenty thousand, even
   thousands of angels," among them he rides<note n="rideth">Auto-modernized</note> on the heavens, and sends<note n="sendeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   out the voice of his strength, attended with ten thousand times ten
   thousand of his holy ones; glorious in his subjects, -- all creatures
   in heaven and in earth, nothing is left that is not put in subjection
   to him; glorious in his way of rule, and the administration of his
   kingdom, -- full of sweetness, efficacy, power, serenity, holiness,
   righteousness, and grace, in and towards his elect, -- of terror,
   vengeance, and certain destruction towards the rebellious angels and
   men; glorious in the issue of his kingdom, when every knee shall bow
   before him, and all shall stand before his judgment-seat. And what a
   little portion of his glory is it that we have pointed to! This is the
   beloved of the church, -- its head, its husband; this is he with whom
   we have communion: but of the whole exaltation of Jesus Christ I am
   elsewhere to treat at large.
				</p><p>
   Having insisted on these generals, for the farther carrying on the
   motives to communion with Christ, in the relation mentioned, taken from
   his excellencies and perfections, I shall reflect on the description
   given of him by the spouse in the Canticles, to this very end and
   purpose <reference osisRef="Song.5.10-Song.5.16">Song of Solomon 5:10-16</reference>, "My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest
   among ten thousand. His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are
   bushy, and black as a raven. His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the
   rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set. His cheeks are as a
   bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping
   sweet-smelling myrrh. His hands are as gold rings, set with the beryl:
   his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. His legs are as
   pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as
   Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is
   altogether lovely. This is my Beloved, and this is my friend, O
   daughters of Jerusalem."
				</p><p>
   The general description given of him, verse 10, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been before
   considered; the ensuing particulars are instances to make good the
   assertion that he is "the chiefest among ten thousand."
				</p><p>
   The spouse begins with his head and face, verses 11-13. In his head,
   she speaks first in general, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the substance of it, -- it is "fine
   gold;" and then in particular, as to its ornaments, -- "his locks are
   bushy, and black as a raven."
				</p><p>
   1. "His head is as the most fine gold," or, "His head gold, solid
   gold;" so some; -- "made of pure gold;" so others; -- chrusion kephale,
   say the LXX., retaining part of both the Hebrew words, "ktm pz, --
   "massa auri." [136]
				</p><p>
   Two things are eminent in gold, -- splendour or glory, and duration.
   This is that which the spouse speaks of the head of Christ. His head is
   his government, authority, and kingdom. Hence it is said, "A crown of
   pure gold was on his head," <reference osisRef="Ps.21.3">Psalms 21:3</reference>; and his head is here said to be
   gold, because of the crown of gold that adorns it, -- as the monarchy
   in Daniel that was most eminent for glory and duration, is termed a
   "head of gold," <reference osisRef="Dan.2.38">Daniel 2:38</reference> And these two things are eminent in the
   kingdom and authority of Christ: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) It is a glorious kingdom; he is full of glory and majesty, and in
   his majesty he rides "prosperously," <reference osisRef="Ps.45.3-Ps.45.4">Psalms 45:3-4</reference> "His glory is great
   in the salvation of God: honour and majesty are laid upon him: he is
   made blessed for ever and ever," <reference osisRef="Ps.21.5-Ps.21.6">Psalms 21:5-6</reference> I might insist on
   particulars, and show that there is not any thing that may render a
   kingdom or government glorious, but it is in this of Christ in all its
   excellencies. It is a heavenly, a spiritual, a universal, and unshaken
   kingdom; all which render it glorious. But of this, somewhat before.
				</p><p>
   (2.) It is durable, yea, eternal, -- solid gold. "His throne is for
   ever and ever," <reference osisRef="Ps.45.6">Psalms 45:6</reference>; "of the increase of his government there
   shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to
   order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
   henceforth even for ever," <reference osisRef="Isa.9.7">Isaiah 9:7</reference> "His kingdom is an everlasting
   kingdom," <reference osisRef="Dan.7.27">Daniel 7:27</reference>, -- "a kingdom that shall never be destroyed,"
   chap. ii. 44; for he must reign until all his enemies be subdued. This
   is that head of gold, -- the splendour and eternity of his government.
				</p><p>
   And if you take the head in a natural sense, either the glory of his
   Deity is here attended to, or the fulness and excellency of his wisdom,
   which the head is the seat of. The allegory is not to be straitened,
   while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> we keep to the analogy of faith.
				</p><p>
   2. For the ornaments of his head; his locks, they are said to be
   "bushy," or curled, "black as a raven." His curled locks are black; "as
   a raven," is added by way of illustration of the blackness, not with
   any allusion to the nature of the raven. Take the head spoken of in a
   political sense: his locks of hair -- said to be curled, as seeming to
   be entangled, but really falling in perfect order and beauty, as bushy
   locks -- are his thoughts, and counsels, and ways, in the
   administration of his kingdom. They are black or dark, because of their
   depth and unsearchableness, -- as God is said to dwell in thick
   darkness; and curled or bushy, because of their exact interweavings,
   from his infinite wisdom. His thoughts are many as the hairs of the
   head, seeming to be perplexed and entangled, but really set in a comely
   order, as curled bushy hair; deep and unsearchable, and dreadful to his
   enemies, and full of beauty and comeliness to his beloved. Such are, I
   say, the thoughts of his heart, the counsels of his wisdom, in
   reference to the administrations of his kingdom:  dark, perplexed,
   involved, to a carnal eye; in themselves, and to his saints, deep,
   manifold, ordered in all things, comely, desirable.
				</p><p>
   In a natural sense, black and curled locks denote comeliness, and
   vigour of youth. The strength and power of Christ, in the execution of
   his counsels, in all his ways, appears glorious and lovely.
				</p><p>
   The next thing described in him is his eyes. Verse 12, "His eyes are as
   the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly
   set." The reason of this allusion is obvious:  doves are tender birds,
   not birds of prey; and of all others they have the most bright,
   shining, and piercing eye; their delight also in streams of water is
   known. Their being washed in milk, or clear, white, crystal water, adds
   to their beauty. And they are here said to be "fitly set;" that is, in
   due proportion for beauty and lustre, -- as a precious stone in the
   foil or fulness of a ring, as the word signifies.
				</p><p>
   Eyes being for sight, discerning, knowledge, and acquaintance with the
   things that are to be seen; the knowledge, the understanding, the
   discerning Spirit of Christ Jesus, are here intended. In the allusion
   used four things are ascribed to them:  1. Tenderness; 2. Purity; 3.
   Discerning; and, 4. Glory: 
				</p><p>
   1. The tenderness and compassion of Christ towards his church is here
   intended. He looks on it with the eyes of galless doves; with
   tenderness and careful compassion; without anger, fury, or thoughts of
   revenge. So is the eye interpreted, <reference osisRef="Deut.11.12">Deuteronomy 11:12</reference>, "The eyes of the Lord
   your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> God are upon that land." Why so? "It is a land that the Lord your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   God cares<note n="careth">Auto-modernized</note> for;" -- cares<note n="careth">Auto-modernized</note> for it in mercy. So are the eyes of Christ
   on us, as the eyes of one that in tenderness cares for us; that lays
   out his wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, in all tender love, in
   our behalf. He is the stone, that foundation-stone of the church,
   whereon "are seven eyes," <reference osisRef="Zech.3.9">Zechariah 3:9</reference>; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> is a perfection of
   wisdom, knowledge, care, and kindness, for its guidance.
				</p><p>
   2. Purity; -- as washed doves' eyes for purity. This may be taken
   either subjectively, for the excellency and immixed cleanness and
   purity of his sight and knowledge in himself; or objectively, for his
   delighting to behold purity in others. "He is of purer eyes than to
   behold iniquity," <reference osisRef="Hab.1.13">Habakkuk 1:13</reference> "He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no pleasure in wickedness; the
   foolish shall not stand in his sight," <reference osisRef="Ps.5.4-Ps.5.5">Psalms 5:4-5</reference> If the righteous
   soul of Lot was vexed with seeing the filthy deeds of wicked men, <reference osisRef="2Pet.2.8">2 Peter 2:8</reference>, who yet had eyes of flesh, in which there was a mixture of
   impurity; how much more do the pure eyes of our dear Lord Jesus
   abominate all the filthiness of sinners! But in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> lies the excellency
   of his love to us, that he takes care to take away our filth and
   stains, that he may delight in us; and seeing we are so defiled, that
   it could no otherwise be done, he will do it by his own blood, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25-Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:25-27</reference>, "Even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it,
   that he might sanctify and cleanse it, with the washing of water by the
   word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
   spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and
   without blemish." The end of this undertaking is, that the church might
   be thus gloriously presented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, because he is of purer eyes
   than to behold it with joy and delight in any other condition. He
   leaves not his spouse until he says of her, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> all fair, my
   love; there is no spot in you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Song.4.7">Song of Solomon 4:7</reference> Partly, he takes away our
   spots and stains, by the "renewing of the Holy Ghost;" [137] and wholly
   adorns us with his own righteousness: and that because of the purity of
   his own eyes, which "cannot behold iniquity," -- that he might present
   us to himself holy.
				</p><p>
   3. Discerning. He sees as doves, quickly, clearly, thoroughly, -- to
   the bottom of that which he looks upon. Hence, in another place it is
   said that his "eyes are as a flame of fire," <reference osisRef="Rev.1.14">Revelation of John 1:14</reference> And why so?
   That the churches might know that he is he which "searches<note n="searcheth">Auto-modernized</note> the reins
   and hearts," <reference osisRef="Rev.2.23">Revelation of John 2:23</reference> He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> discerning eyes, nothing is hid from
   him; all things are open and naked before him with whom we have to do.
   It is said of him, while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> he was in this world, that "Jesus knew all
   men, and needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what
   was in man," <reference osisRef="John.2.24-John.2.25">John 2:24-25</reference> His piercing eyes look through all the
   thick coverings of hypocrites, and the snow [show] of pretences that is
   on them. He sees the inside of all; and what men are there, that they
   are to him. He sees not as we see, but ponders the hidden man of the
   heart. No humble, broken, contrite soul, shall lose one sigh or groan
   after him, and communion with him; no pant of love or desire is hid
   from him, -- he sees in secret; no glorious performance of the most
   glorious hypocrite will avail with him, -- his eyes look through all,
   and the filth of their hearts lies naked before him.
				</p><p>
   4. Beauty and glory are here intended also. Every thing of Christ is
   beautiful, for he is "altogether lovely," verse 16, but most glorious
   [is he] in his sight and wisdom: he is the wisdom of God's eternal
   wisdom itself; his understanding is infinite. What spots and stains are
   in all our knowledge! When it is made perfect, yet it will still be
   finite and limited. His is without spot of darkness, without foil of
   limitedness.
				</p><p>
   Thus, then, is he beautiful and glorious:  his "head is of gold, his
   eyes are doves' eyes, washed in milk, and fitly set."
				</p><p>
   The next thing insisted on is his cheeks. Verse 13, "His cheeks are as
   a bed of spices; as sweet flowers," or "towers of perfumes" [marginal
   reading], or well-grown flowers. There are three things evidently
   pointed at in these words:  1. A sweet savour, as from spices, and
   flowers, and towers of perfume; 2. Beauty and order, as spices set in
   rows or beds, as the words import; 3. Eminency in that word, as sweet
   or well-grown, great flowers.
				</p><p>
   These things are in the cheeks of Christ. The Chaldee paraphrast, who
   applies this whole song to God's dealings with the people of the Jews,
   makes these cheeks of the church's husband to be the two tables of
   stone, with the various lines drawn in them; but that allusion is
   strained, as are most of the conjectures of that scholiast.
				</p><p>
   The cheeks of a man are the seat of comeliness and manlike courage. The
   comeliness of Christ, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in part been declared, is from his
   fulness of grace in himself for us. His manly courage respects the
   administration of his rule and government, from his fulness of
   authority; as was before declared. This comeliness and courage the
   spouse, describing Christ as a beautiful, desirable personage, to show
   that spiritually he is so, calls<note n="calleth">Auto-modernized</note> his cheeks; so to make up his parts,
   and proportion. And to them does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> she ascribe, --
				</p><p>
   1. A sweet savour, order, and eminency. A sweet savour; as God is said
   to smell a sweet savour from the grace and obedience of his servants
   (<reference osisRef="Gen.8.21">Genesis 8:21</reference>, the Lord smelled a savour of rest from the sacrifice of
   Noah), so do the saints smell a sweet savour from his grace laid up in
   Christ, <reference osisRef="Song.1.3">Song of Solomon 1:3</reference> It is that which they rest in, which they delight
   in, which they are refreshed with. As the smell of aromatical spices
   and flowers pleases the natural sense, refreshes the spirits, and
   delights the person; so do the graces of Christ to his saints. They
   please their spiritual sense, they refresh their drooping spirits, and
   give delight to their souls. If he be nigh them, they smell his
   raiment, as Isaac the raiment of Jacob. They say, "It is as the smell
   of a field which the Lord has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> blessed," <reference osisRef="Gen.27.27">Genesis 27:27</reference>; and their
   souls are refreshed with it.
				</p><p>
   2. Order and beauty are as spices set in a garden bed. So are the
   graces of Christ. When spices are set in order, any one may know what
   is for his use, and take and gather it accordingly. Their answering,
   also, one to another makes them beautiful. So are the graces of Christ;
   in the gospel they are distinctly and in order set forth, that sinners
   by faith may view them, and take from him according to their necessity.
   They are ordered for the use of saints in the promises of the gospel.
   There is light in him, and life in him, and power in him, and all
   consolation in him; -- a constellation of graces, shining with glory
   and beauty. Believers take a view of them all, see their glory and
   excellency, but fix especially on that which, in the condition in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   they are, is most useful to them. One takes light and joy; another,
   life and power. By faith and prayer do they gather these things in this
   bed of spices. Not any that comes to him goes away unrefreshed. What
   may they not take, what may they not gather? what is it that the poor
   soul wants? Behold, it is here provided, set out in order in the
   promises of the gospel; which are as the beds in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> these spices are
   set for our use: and on the account of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is the covenant said to be
   "ordered in all things," <reference osisRef="2Sam.23.5">2 Samuel 23:5</reference>
				</p><p>
   3. Eminency. His cheeks are "a tower of perfumes" held up, made
   conspicuous, visible, eminent. So it is with the graces of Christ, when
   held out and lifted up in the preaching of the gospel. They are a tower
   of perfumes, -- a sweet savour to God and man.
				</p><p>
   The next clause of that verse is, "His lips are like lilies, dropping
   sweet-smelling myrrh." Two perfections in things natural are here
   alluded to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>:  First, the glory of colour in the lilies, and the
   sweetness of savour in the myrrh. The glory and beauty of the lilies in
   those countries was such as that our Saviour tells us that "Solomon, in
   all his glory, was not arrayed like one of them," <reference osisRef="Matt.6.29">Matthew 6:29</reference>; and the
   savour of myrrh such as, when the Scripture would set forth any thing
   to be an excellent savour, it compares it to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Ps.45.8">Psalms 45:8</reference>; and
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> was the sweet and holy ointment chiefly made, <reference osisRef="Exod.30.23-Exod.30.25">Exodus 30:23-25</reference>:
   mention is also made frequently of it in other places, to the same
   purpose. It is said of Christ, that "grace was poured into his lips,"
   <reference osisRef="Ps.45.2">Psalms 45:2</reference>; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> men wondered or were amazed -- tois logois tes
   charitos, [<reference osisRef="Luke.4.22">Luke 4:22</reference>] -- at the words of grace that proceeded out of
   his mouth. So that by the lips of Christ, and their dropping
   sweet-smelling myrrh, the word of Christ, its savour, excellency, and
   usefulness, is intended. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is he excellent and glorious indeed,
   surpassing the excellencies of those natural things which yet are most
   precious in their kind, -- even in the glory, beauty, and usefulness of
   his word. Hence they that preach his word to the saving of the souls of
   men, are said to be a "sweet savour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God," <reference osisRef="2Cor.2.15">2 Corinthians 2:15</reference>; and the
   savour of the knowledge of God is said to be manifested by them, verse
   14. I might insist on the several properties of myrrh, whereto the word
   of Christ is here compared, -- its bitterness in taste, its efficacy to
   preserve from putrefaction, its usefulness in perfumes and unctions, --
   and press the allegory in setting out the excellencies of the word in
   allusions to them; but I only insist on generals. This is that which
   the Holy Ghost here intends:  the word of Christ is sweet, savoury,
   precious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> believers; and they see him to be excellent, desirable,
   beautiful, in the precepts, promises, exhortations, and the most bitter
   threats of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   The spouse adds, "His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl"
   [verse 14]. The word "beryl," in the original, is "Tarshish;" [138]
   which the Septuagint have retained, not restraining it to any peculiar
   precious stone; the onyx, say some; the chrysolite, say others; -- any
   precious stone shining with a sea-green colour, for the word signifies
   the sea also. Gold rings set with precious, glittering stones, are both
   valuable and desirable, for profit and ornament: so are the hands of
   Christ; that is, all his works, -- the effects, by the cause. All his
   works are glorious; they are all fruits of wisdom, love, and bounty.
   "And his belly is as bright ivory, overlaid with sapphires." The
   smoothness and brightness of ivory, the preciousness and heavenly
   colour of the sapphires, are here called in, to give some lustre to the
   excellency of Christ." To these is his belly, or rather his bowels
   (which takes in the heart also), compared. It is the inward bowels, and
   not the outward bulk that is signified. Now, to show that by "bowels"
   in the Scripture, ascribed either to God or man, affections are
   intended, is needless. The tender love, unspeakable affections and
   kindness, of Christ to his church and people, is thus set out. What a
   beautiful sight is it to the eye, to see pure polished ivory set up and
   down with heaps of precious sapphires! How much more glorious are the
   tender affections, mercies, and compassion of the Lord Jesus to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   believers!
				</p><p>
   Verse 15. The strength of his kingdom, the faithfulness and stability
   of his promises, -- the height and glory of his person in his dominion,
   -- the sweetness and excellency of communion with him, is set forth in
   these words: "His legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of
   fine gold; his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars: his
   mouth is most sweet."
				</p><p>
   When the spouse has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> gone thus far in the description of him, she
   concludes all in this general assertion: "He is wholly desirable, --
   altogether to be desired or beloved." As if she should have said, -- "I
   have thus reckoned up some of the perfections of the creatures (things
   of most value, price, usefulness, beauty, glory, here below), and
   compared some of the excellencies of my Beloved to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. In this way
   of allegory I can carry things no higher; I find nothing better or more
   desirable to shadow out and to present his loveliness and
   desirableness: but, alas! all this comes short of his perfections,
   beauty, and comeliness; he is all wholly to be desired, to be
   beloved;'?" --
				</p><p>
   Lovely in his person, -- in the glorious all-sufficiency of his Deity,
   gracious purity and holiness of his humanity, authority and majesty,
   love and power.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in his birth and incarnation; when he was rich, for our sakes
   becoming poor, -- taking part of flesh and blood, because we partook of
   the same; being made of a woman, that for us he might be made under the
   law, even for our sakes.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in the whole course of his life, and the more than angelical
   holiness and obedience which, in the depth of poverty and persecution,
   he exercised in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; -- doing good, receiving evil; blessing, and
   being cursed, reviled, reproached, all his days.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in his death; yea, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> most lovely to sinners; -- never more
   glorious and desirable than when he came broken, dead, from the cross.
   Then had he carried all our sins into a land of forgetfulness; then had
   he made peace and reconciliation for us; then had he procured life and
   immortality for us.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in his whole employment, in his great undertaking, -- in his
   life, death, resurrection, ascension; being a mediator between God and
   us, to recover the glory of God's justice, and to save our souls, -- to
   bring us to an enjoyment of God, who were set at such an infinite
   distance from him by sin.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in the glory and majesty with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he is crowned. Now he is set
   down at the right hand of the Majesty on high; where, though he be
   terrible to his enemies, yet he is full of mercy, love, and compassion,
   towards his beloved ones.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in all those supplies of grace and consolations, in all the
   dispensations of his Holy Spirit, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> his saints are made
   partakers.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in all the tender care, power, and wisdom, which he exercises in
   the protection, safe-guarding, and delivery of his church and people,
   in the midst of all the oppositions and persecutions to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they are
   exposed.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in all his ordinances, and the whole of that spiritually
   glorious worship which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed to his people, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they
   draw nigh and have communion with him and his Father.
				</p><p>
   Lovely and glorious in the vengeance he takes<note n="taketh">Auto-modernized</note>, and will finally
   execute, upon the stubborn enemies of himself and his people.
				</p><p>
   Lovely in the pardon he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> purchased and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> dispense, -- in the
   reconciliation he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> established, -- in the grace he communicates, --
   in the consolations he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> administer, -- in the peace and joy he
   gives his saints, -- in his assured preservation of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> glory.
				</p><p>
   What shall I say? there is no end of his excellencies and
   desirableness; -- "He is altogether lovely. This is our beloved, and
   this is our friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."

   [136] So the words are quoted in all editions of this treatise. Fully
   to develop the meaning of the allusion, it seems necessary that the
   whole of the Septuagint rendering should be quoted, -- Kephale autou
   chrusion kephaz. It is the last word in which part of both the Hebrew
   words is said to be retained. There is some difficulty in fixing the
   import of pz. Gesenius refers us to <reference osisRef="Ps.19.10">Psalms 19:10</reference>, in proof that it means
   fine, as distinguished from common gold; from pzz, a root not used in
   Hebrew, but signifying, in the cognate dialect of Arabic, to separate,
   to purify metals. Some connect the term with Uphaz, a district from
   which gold was procured, <reference osisRef="Jer.10.9">Jeremiah 10:9</reference> Schultens derives the word from
   pzz, to leap, to spring up into notice, in allusion to the amount of
   gold discovered on the surface of the earth, through the previous
   disintegration of the rock in which it was disseminated, and when a
   shower has washed it from the soil by which it was covered. There is
   coincidence between the etymology of the word suggested by the Dutch
   critic, and the fact that the largest quantities of gold and gold ore
   have been discovered, not by excavation, but by the washing of detritus
   in regions of primary and transitory strata where the eruption of
   igneous rocks has occurred: "As for the earth, ... it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> dust of
   gold," <reference osisRef="Job.28.5-Job.28.6">Job 28:5-6</reference> -- Ed.

   [138] As Ophir is taken for the gold of Ophir, in <reference osisRef="Job.22.24">Job 22:24</reference>, so
   Tarshish, the name of a city, of which the locality is disputed, is
   used to denote a precious stone which was brought from it. It is
   translated "beryl" in the authorized version, though shm, in <reference osisRef="Ezek.28.13">Ezekiel 28:13</reference>, is also rendered by the same term. Some make trsys, the
   chrysolite or topaz of the moderns. The word has been thought to denote
   the sea, in <reference osisRef="Isa.23.10">Isaiah 23:10</reference>, but on slender ground. -- Ed.

<title>Digression II.</title>
<p>   All solid wisdom laid up in Christ -- True wisdom, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it consists
   -- Knowledge of God, in Christ only to be obtained -- What of God may
   be known by his works -- Some properties of God not discovered but in
   Christ only; love, mercy -- Others not fully but in him; as vindictive
   justice, patience, wisdom, all-sufficiency -- No property of God
   savingly known but in Christ -- What is required to a saving knowledge
   of the properties of God -- No true knowledge of ourselves but in
   Christ -- Knowledge of ourselves, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> -- Knowledge of
   sin, how to be had in Christ; also of righteousness and of judgment --
   The wisdom of walking with God hid in Christ -- What is required
   to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> -- Other pretenders to the title of wisdom examined and
   rejected -- Christ alone exalted.
				</p><p>
   A second consideration of the excellencies of Christ, serving to endear
   the hearts of them who stand with him in the relation insisted on,
   arises from that which, in the mistaken apprehension of it, is the
   great darling of men, and in its true notion the great aim of the
   saints; which is wisdom and knowledge. Let it be evinced that all true
   and solid knowledge is laid up in, and is only to be attained from and
   by, the Lord Jesus Christ; and the hearts of men, if they are but true
   to themselves and their most predominate principles, must needs be
   engaged to him. This is the great design of all men, taken off from
   professed slavery to the world, and the pursuit of sensual, licentious
   courses, -- that they maybe wise: and what ways the generality of men
   engage in for the compassing of that end shall be afterward considered.
   To the glory and honour of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, and the
   establishment of our hearts in communion with him, the design of this
   digression is to evince that all wisdom is laid up in him, and that
   from him alone it is to be obtained.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.24">1 Corinthians 1:24</reference>, the Holy Ghost tells us that "Christ is the power of God,
   and the wisdom of God:" not the essential Wisdom of God, as he is the
   eternal Son of the Father (upon which account he is called "Wisdom" in
   the <reference osisRef="Prov">Proverbs</reference>); but as he is crucified, verse 23. As
   he is crucified, so he is the wisdom of God; that is, all that wisdom
   which God lays<note n="layeth">Auto-modernized</note> forth for the discovery and manifestation of himself,
   and for the saving of sinners, which makes foolish all the wisdom of
   the world, -- that is all in Christ crucified; held out in him, by him,
   and to be obtained only from him. And thereby in him do we see the
   glory of God, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> For he is not only said to be "the wisdom
   of God," but also to be "made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us wisdom," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference> He is
   made, not by creation, but ordination and appointment, wisdom to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us;
   not only by teaching us wisdom (by a metonymy of the effect for the
   cause), as he is the great prophet of his church, but also because by
   the knowing of him we become acquainted with the wisdom of God, --
   which is our wisdom; which is a metonymy of the adjunct. This, however
   verily promised, is thus only to be had. The sum of what is contended
   for is asserted in terms, <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference>, "In him are hid all the treasures
   of wisdom and knowledge."
				</p><p>
   There are two things that might seem to have some colour in claiming a
   title and interest in this business:  1. Civil wisdom and prudence,
   for the management of affairs; 2. Ability of learning and literature;
   -- but God rejects<note n="rejecteth">Auto-modernized</note> both these, as of no use at all to the end and
   intent of true wisdom indeed. There is in the world that which is
   called "understanding;" but it comes to nothing. There is that which is
   called "wisdom;" but it is turned into folly, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.19-1Cor.1.20">1 Corinthians 1:19-20</reference>, "God
   brings to nothing the understanding of the prudent, and makes foolish
   this wisdom of the world." And if there be neither wisdom nor knowledge
   (as doubtless there is not), without the knowledge of God, <reference osisRef="Jer.8.9">Jeremiah 8:9</reference>, it is all shut up in the Lord Jesus Christ: "No man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen God at
   any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> revealed him." He is not seen at another time, <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference>, nor
   known upon any other account, but only the revelation of the Son. He
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested him from his own bosom; and therefore, verse 9, it is
   said that he is "the true Light, which lights<note n="lighteth">Auto-modernized</note> every man that comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note>
   into the world," -- the true Light, which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it in himself: and none
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any but from him; and all have it who come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. He who does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   not so, is in darkness.
				</p><p>
   The sum of all true wisdom and knowledge may be reduced to these three
   heads:  I. The knowledge of God, his nature and his properties. II.
   The knowledge of ourselves in reference to the will of God concerning
   us. III. Skill to walk in communion with God: 
				</p><p>
   I. The knowledge of the works of God, and the chief end of all, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   necessarily attend these. 1. In these three is summed up all true
   wisdom and knowledge; and, 2, -- Not any of them is to any purpose to
   be obtained, or is manifested, but only in and by the Lord Christ: 
				</p><p>
   1. God, by the work of the creation, by the creation itself, did reveal
   himself in many of his properties to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his creatures capable of his
   knowledge; -- his power, his goodness, his wisdom, his all-sufficiency,
   are thereby known. This the apostle asserts, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.19-Rom.1.21">Romans 1:19-21</reference> Verse 19,
   he calls it to gnoston tou Theou, -- verse 20, that is, his eternal
   power and Godhead; and verse 21, a knowing of God: and [139] all this
   by the creation. But yet there are some properties of God which all the
   works of creation cannot in any measure reveal or make known; -- as his
   patience, long-suffering, and forbearance. For all things being made
   [140] good, there could be no place for the exercise of any of these
   properties, or manifestation of them. The whole fabric of heaven and
   earth considered in itself, as at first created, will not discover any
   such thing as patience and forbearance in God; [141] which yet are
   eminent properties of his nature, as himself proclaims and declares,
   <reference osisRef="Exod.34.6-Exod.34.7">Exodus 34:6-7</reference>
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord goes farther; and by the works of his providence, in
   preserving and ruling the world which he made, discovers and reveals
   these properties also. For whereas by cursing the earth, and filling
   all the elements oftentimes with signs of his anger and indignation, he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, as the apostle tells us, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.18">Romans 1:18</reference>, "revealed from heaven his
   wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men;" yet not
   proceeding immediately to destroy all things, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested his
   patience and forbearance to all. This Paul, <reference osisRef="Acts.14.16-Acts.14.17">Acts 14:16-17</reference>, tells us:
   "He suffered all nations to walk in their own ways; yet he left not
   himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave rain from heaven
   and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness." A
   large account of his goodness and wisdom in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the psalmist gives us,
   Ps. civ. throughout. By these ways he bare witness to his own goodness
   and patience; and so it is said, "He endures with much long-suffering,"
   etc., <reference osisRef="Rom.9.22">Romans 9:22</reference> But now, here all the world is at a stand; by all
   this they have but an obscure glimpse of God, and see not so much as
   his back parts. Moses saw not that, until he was put into [142] the
   rock; and that rock was Christ. There are some of the most eminent and
   glorious properties of God (I mean, in the manifestation of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he
   will be most glorious; otherwise his properties are not to be compared)
   that there is not the least glimpse to be attained of out of the Lord
   Christ, but only by and in him; and some that comparatively we have no
   light of but in him; and of all the rest no true light but by him: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) Of the first sort, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> not the least guess and imagination can
   enter into the heart of man but only by Christ, are love and pardoning
   mercy: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] Love; I mean love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sinners. Without this, man is of all
   creatures most miserable; and there is not the least glimpse of it that
   can possibly be discovered but in Christ. The Holy Ghost says, <reference osisRef="1John.4.8 1John.4.16">1 John 4:8, 16</reference>, "God is love;" that is, not only of a loving and tender
   nature, but one that will exercise himself in a dispensation of his
   love, eternal love, towards us, -- one that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> purposes of love for
   us from of old, and will fulfil them all towards us in due season. But
   how is this demonstrated? how may we attain an acquaintance with it? He
   tells us, verse 9, "In this was manifested the love of God, because
   that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live
   through him." This is the only discovery that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of any such
   property in his nature, or of any thought of exercising it towards
   sinners, -- in that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent Jesus Christ into the world, that we
   might live by him. Where now is the wise, where is the scribe, where is
   the disputer of this world, with all their wisdom? Their voice must be
   that of the hypocrites in Zion, <reference osisRef="Isa.33.14-Isa.33.15">Isaiah 33:14-15</reference> That wisdom which
   cannot teach me that God is love, shall ever pass for folly. Let men go
   to the sun, moon, and stars, to showers of rain and fruitful seasons,
   and answer truly what by them they learn of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Let them not think
   themselves wiser or better than those that went before them, who, to a
   man, got nothing by them, but being left inexcusable.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Pardoning mercy, or grace. Without this, even his love would be
   fruitless. What discovery may be made of this by a sinful man, may be
   seen in the father of us all; who, when he had sinned, had no reserve
   for mercy, but hid himself, <reference osisRef="Gen.3.8">Genesis 3:8</reference> He did it lrvch hyvm, when the
   wind did but a little blow at the presence of God; and he did it
   foolishly, thinking to "hide himself among trees!" <reference osisRef="Ps.139.7-Ps.139.8">Psalms 139:7-8</reference>
   "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,"
   <reference osisRef="John.1.17">John 1:17</reference>, -- grace in the truth and substance. Pardoning mercy, that
   comes by Christ alone; that pardoning mercy which is manifested in the
   gospel, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God will be glorified to all eternity, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.6">Ephesians 1:6</reference> I
   mean not that general mercy, that velleity of acceptance which some put
   their hopes in: [143] that pathos (which to ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God is the
   greatest dishonour that can be done him) shines not with one ray out of
   Christ; it is wholly treasured up in him, and revealed by him.
   Pardoning mercy is God's free, gracious acceptance of a sinner upon
   satisfaction made to his justice in the blood of Jesus; nor is any
   discovery of it, but as relating to the satisfaction of justice,
   consistent with the glory of God. It is a mercy of inconceivable
   condescension in forgiveness, tempered with exact justice and severity.
   <reference osisRef="Rom.3.25">Romans 3:25</reference>, God is said "to set forth Christ to be a propitiation
   through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness in the
   remission of sins;" [144] his righteousness is also manifested in the
   business of forgiveness of sins: and therefore it is everywhere said to
   be wholly in Christ, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.7">Ephesians 1:7</reference> So that this gospel grace and pardoning
   mercy is alone purchased by him, and revealed in him. And this was the
   main end of all typical institutions, -- to manifest that remission and
   forgiveness is wholly wrapped up in the Lord Christ, and that out of
   him there is not the least conjecture to be made of it, nor the least
   morsel to be tasted. Had not God set forth [145] the Lord Christ, all
   the angels in heaven and men on earth could not have apprehended that
   there had been any such thing in the nature of God as this grace of
   pardoning mercy. The apostle asserts the full manifestation as well as
   the exercise of this mercy to be in Christ only, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.4-Titus.3.5">Titus 3:4-5</reference>, "After
   that the kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared," --
   namely, in the sending of Christ, and the declaration of him in the
   gospel. Then was this pardoning mercy and salvation not by works
   discovered.
				</p><p>
   And these are of those properties of God through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he will be known,
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> there is not the least glimpse to be obtained but by and in
   Christ; and whoever knows him not by these, knows him not at all. They
   know an idol, and not the only true God. He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not the Son, the
   same has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not the Father, <reference osisRef="1John.2.23">1 John 2:23</reference>; and not to have God as a
   Father, is not to have him at all; and he is known as a Father only as
   he is love, and full of pardoning mercy in Christ. How this is to be
   had the Holy Ghost tells us, <reference osisRef="1John.5.20">1 John 5:20</reference>, "The Son of God is come and
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true." By
   him alone we have our understanding to know him that is true. Now,
   these properties of God Christ reveals<note n="revealeth">Auto-modernized</note> in his doctrine, in the
   revelation he makes of God and his will, as the great prophet of the
   church, <reference osisRef="John.17.6">John 17:6</reference> And on this account the knowledge of them is
   exposed to all, with an evidence unspeakably surmounting that which is
   given by the creation to his eternal power and Godhead. But the life of
   this knowledge lies in an acquaintance with his person, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   express image and beams of this glory of his Father do shine forth,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>; of which before.
				</p><p>
   (2.) There are other properties of God which, though also otherwise
   discovered, yet are so clearly, eminently, and savingly only in Jesus
   Christ; as, -- [1.] His vindictive justice in punishing sin; [2.] His
   patience, forbearance, and long-suffering towards sinners; [3.] His
   wisdom, in managing things for his own glory; [4.] His all-sufficiency,
   in himself and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others. All these, though they may receive some
   lower and inferior manifestations out of Christ, yet they clearly shine
   only in him; so as that it may be our wisdom to be acquainted with
   them.
				</p><p>
   [1.] His vindictive justice. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, indeed, many ways manifested his
   indignation and anger against sin; so that men cannot but know that it
   is "the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy
   of death," <reference osisRef="Rom.1.32">Romans 1:32</reference> He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in the law threatened to kindle a fire
   in his anger that shall burn to the very heart of hell. And even in
   many providential dispensations, "his wrath is revealed from heaven
   against all the ungodliness of men," <reference osisRef="Rom.1.18">Romans 1:18</reference> So that men must say
   that he is a God of judgment. And he that shall but consider that the
   angels for sin were cast from heaven, shut up under chains of
   everlasting darkness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the judgment of the great day (the [146]
   rumour of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> seems to have been spread among the Gentiles, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> the
   poet makes his Jupiter threaten the inferior rebellious deities with
   that punishment); and how Sodom and Gomorrah were condemned with an
   overthrow, and burned into ashes, that they might be "examples to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   those that should after live ungodly," <reference osisRef="2Pet.2.6">2 Peter 2:6</reference>; cannot but
   discover much of God's vindictive justice and his anger against sin.
   But far more clear does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this shine into us in the Lord Christ: 
				</p><p>
   1st. In him God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested the naturalness of this righteousness
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, in that it was impossible that it should be diverted from
   sinners without the interposing of a propitiation. Those who lay the
   necessity of satisfaction merely upon the account of a free act and
   determination of the will of God, leave, to my apprehension, no just
   and indispensable [147] foundation for the death of Christ, but lay it
   upon a supposition of that which might have been otherwise. But
   plainly, God, in that he [148] spared not his only Son, but made his
   soul an offering for sin, and would admit of no atonement but in his
   blood, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> abundantly manifested that it is of necessity to him (his
   holiness and righteousness requiring it) to render indignation, wrath,
   tribulation, and anguish to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sin. And the knowledge of this
   naturalness of vindictive justice, with the necessity of its execution
   on supposition of sin, is the only true and useful knowledge of it. To
   look upon it as that which God may exercise or forbear, makes his
   justice not a property of his nature, but a free act of his will; and a
   will to punish where one may do otherwise without injustice, is rather
   ill-will than justice.
				</p><p>
   2dly. In the penalty inflicted on Christ for sin, this justice is far
   more gloriously manifested than otherwise. To see, indeed, a world,
   made [149] good and beautiful, wrapped up in wrath and curses, clothed
   with thorns and briers; to see the whole beautiful creation made
   subject to vanity, given up to the bondage of corruption; to hear it
   groan in pain under that burden; to consider legions of angels, most
   glorious and immortal creatures, cast down into hell, bound with chains
   of darkness, and reserved for a more dreadful judgment for one sin; to
   view the ocean of the blood of souls spilt to eternity on this account,
   -- will give some insight into this thing. But what is all this to that
   view of it which may be had by a spiritual eye in the Lord Christ? All
   these things are worms, and of no value in comparison of him. To see
   him who is the [150] wisdom of God, and the power of God, always [151]
   beloved of the Father; to see him, I say, fear, [152] and tremble, and
   bow, and sweat, and pray, and die; to see him lifted up upon the cross,
   the earth trembling under him, as if unable to bear his weight; and the
   heavens darkened over him, as if shut against his cry; and himself
   hanging between both, as if refused by both; and all this because our
   sins did meet upon him; -- this of all things does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> most abundantly
   manifest the severity of God's vindictive justice. Here, or nowhere, is
   it to be learned.
				</p><p>
   [2.] His patience, forbearance, and long-suffering towards sinners.
   There are many glimpses of the patience of God shining out in the works
   of his providence; but all exceedingly beneath that discovery of it
   which we have in Christ, especially in these three things: 
				</p><p>
   1st. The manner of its discovery. This, indeed, is evident to all, that
   God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not ordinarily immediately punish men upon their offences. It
   may be learned from his constant way in governing the world:
   notwithstanding all provocations, yet he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> [153] good to men;
   causing his sun to shine upon them, sending them rain and fruitful
   seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness. Hence it was easy
   for them to conclude that there was in him abundance of goodness and
   forbearance. But all this is yet in much darkness, being the exurgency
   of men's reasonings from their observations; yea, the management of it
   [God's patience] has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been such as that it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> proved a snare almost
   universally to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them towards whom it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been exercised, <reference osisRef="Eccl.8.11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</reference>, as well as a temptation to them who have looked on, <reference osisRef="Job.21.7">Job 21:7</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.73.2-Ps.73.4">Psalms 73:2-4</reference>, etc.; <reference osisRef="Jer.12.1">Jeremiah 12:1</reference>; <reference osisRef="Hab.1.13">Habakkuk 1:13</reference> The discovery of it
   in Christ is utterly of another nature. In him the very nature of God
   is discovered to be love and kindness; and that he will exercise the
   same to sinners, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised, sworn, and solemnly engaged himself
   by covenant. And that we may not hesitate about the aim which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, there is a stable bottom and foundation of acting suitably to
   those gracious properties of his nature held forth, -- namely, the
   reconciliation and atonement that is made in the blood of Christ.
   Whatever discovery were made of the patience and lenity of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us,
   yet if it were not withal revealed that the other properties of God, as
   his justice and revenge for sin, had their actings also assigned to
   them to the full, there could be little consolation gathered from the
   former. And therefore, though God may teach men his goodness and
   forbearance, by sending them rain and fruitful seasons, yet withal at
   the same time, upon all occasions, "revealing his wrath from heaven
   against the ungodliness of men," <reference osisRef="Rom.1.18">Romans 1:18</reference>, it is impossible that they
   should do any thing but miserably fluctuate and tremble at the event of
   these dispensations; and yet this is the best that men can have out of
   Christ, the utmost they can attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. With the present possession of
   good things administered in this patience, men might, and did for a
   season, take up their thoughts and satiate themselves; but yet they
   were not in the least delivered from the [154] bondage they were in by
   reason of death, and the darkness attending it. The law reveals no
   patience or forbearance in God; it speaks, as to the issue of
   transgressions, nothing but sword and fire, had not God interposed by
   an act of sovereignty. But now, as was said, with that revelation of
   forbearance which we have in Christ, there is also a discovery of the
   satisfaction of his justice and wrath against sin; so that we need not
   fear any actings from them to interfere with the works of his patience,
   which are so sweet to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. Hence God is said to be "in Christ,
   reconciling the world to himself," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.19">2 Corinthians 5:19</reference>; manifesting himself in
   him as one that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> now no more to do for the manifestation of all his
   attributes, -- that is, for the glorifying of himself, -- but only to
   forbear, reconcile, and pardon sin in him.
				</p><p>
   2dly. In the nature of it. What is there in that forbearance which out
   of Christ is revealed? Merely a not immediate punishing upon the [155]
   offence, and, withal, giving and continuing temporal mercies; such
   things as men are prone to abuse, and may perish with their bosoms full
   of them to eternity. That which lies hid in Christ, and is revealed
   from him, is full of love, sweetness, tenderness, kindness, grace. It
   is the Lord's waiting to be gracious to sinners; waiting for an
   advantage to show love and kindness, for the most eminent endearing of
   a soul to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, <reference osisRef="Isa.30.18">Isaiah 30:18</reference>, "Therefore will the Lord wait, that
   he may be gracious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he
   may have mercy upon you." Neither is there any revelation of God that
   the soul finds more sweetness in than this. When it [one's soul] is
   experimentally convinced that God from time to time has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> passed by
   many, innumerable iniquities, he is astonished to think that God should
   do so; and admires that he did not take the advantage of his
   provocations to cast him out of his presence. He finds that, with
   infinite wisdom, in all long-suffering, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> managed all his
   dispensations towards him to recover him from the power of the devil,
   to rebuke and chasten his spirit for sin, to endear him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself;
   -- there is, I say, nothing of greater sweetness to the soul than this:
   and therefore the apostle says, <reference osisRef="Rom.3.25">Romans 3:25</reference>, that all is "through the
   forbearance of God." God makes way for complete forgiveness of sins
   through this his forbearance; which the other does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not.
				</p><p>
   3dly. They differ in their ends and aims. What is the aim and design of
   God in the dispensation of that forbearance which is manifested and may
   be discovered out of Christ? The apostle tells us, <reference osisRef="Rom.9.22">Romans 9:22</reference>, "What
   if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured
   with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction?"
   It was but to leave them inexcusable, that his power and wrath against
   sin might be manifested in their destruction. And therefore he calls it
   "a suffering of them to walk in their own ways," <reference osisRef="Acts.14.16">Acts 14:16</reference>; which
   elsewhere he holds out as a most dreadful judgment, -- to wit, in
   respect of that issue whereto it will certainly come; as <reference osisRef="Ps.81.12">Psalms 81:12</reference>,
   "I gave them up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their own hearts' lusts, and they walked in their
   own counsels:" which is as dreadful a [156] condition as a creature is
   capable of falling into in this world. And <reference osisRef="Acts.17.30">Acts 17:30</reference>, he calls it a
   "winking at the sins of their ignorance;" as it were taking no care nor
   thought of them in their dark condition, as it appears by the
   antithesis, "But now he commands<note n="commandeth">Auto-modernized</note> all men everywhere to repent." He
   did not take so much notice of them then as to command them to repent,
   by any clear revelation of his mind and will. And therefore the
   exhortation of the apostle, <reference osisRef="Rom.2.4">Romans 2:4</reference>, "Despisest you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> the riches of
   his goodness and forbearance and long suffering, not knowing that the
   goodness of God leads<note n="leadeth">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> to repentance?" is spoken to the Jews, who
   had advantages to learn the natural tendency of that goodness and
   forbearance which God exercises in Christ; which, indeed, leads to
   repentance: or else he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> in general intimate that, in very reason,
   men ought to make another use of those things than usually they do, and
   which he charges<note n="chargeth">Auto-modernized</note> them withal, verse 5, "But after your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> hardness and
   impenitent heart," etc. At [157] best, then, the patience of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   men out of Christ, by reason of their own incorrigible stubbornness,
   proves but like the waters of the river Phasis, that are sweet at the
   top and bitter in the bottom; they swim for a while in the sweet and
   good things of this life, <reference osisRef="Luke.16.25">Luke 16:25</reference>; with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> being filled, they
   sink to the depth of all bitterness.
				</p><p>
   But now, evidently and directly, the end of that patience and
   forbearance of God which is exercised in Christ, and discovered in him
   to us, is the saving and bringing into God those towards whom he is
   pleased to exercise them. And therefore Peter tells you, <reference osisRef="2Pet.3.9">2 Peter 3:9</reference>,
   that he is "long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance;" -- that is, all us
   towards whom he exercises forbearance; for that is the end of it, that
   his will concerning our repentance and salvation may be accomplished.
   And the nature of it, with its end, is well expressed, <reference osisRef="Isa.54.9">Isaiah 54:9</reference>,
   "This is as the waters of Noah to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me: for as I have sworn that the
   waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I
   would not be wroth," etc. It is God's taking a course, in his infinite
   wisdom and goodness, that we shall not be destroyed notwithstanding our
   sins; and therefore, <reference osisRef="Rom.15.5">Romans 15:5</reference>, these two things are laid together in
   God, as coming together from him, "The God of patience and
   consolation:" his patience is a matter of the greatest consolation. And
   this is another property of God, which, though it may break forth in
   some rays, to some ends and purposes, in other things, yet the
   treasures of it are hid in Christ; and none is acquainted with it, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   any spiritual advantage, that learns it not in him.
				</p><p>
   [3.] His wisdom, his infinite wisdom, in managing things for his own
   glory, and the good of them towards whom he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> thoughts of love. The
   Lord, indeed, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> laid out and manifested infinite wisdom [158] in his
   works of creation, providence, and governing of his world: in wisdom
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he made all his creatures. "How manifold are his works! in wisdom
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he made them all; the earth is full of his riches," <reference osisRef="Ps.104.24">Psalms 104:24</reference>
   So in his providence, his support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note> and guidance of all things, in
   order to one another, and his own glory, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ends appointed for
   them; for all these things "come forth from the Lord of hosts, who is
   wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working," <reference osisRef="Isa.28.29">Isaiah 28:29</reference> His
   law also is for ever to be admired, for the excellency of the wisdom
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Deut.4.7-Deut.4.8">Deuteronomy 4:7-8</reference> But yet there is that which Paul is astonished
   at, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God will for ever be exalted, which he calls, "The
   depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God," <reference osisRef="Rom.11.33">Romans 11:33</reference>;
   -- that is only hid in and revealed by Christ. Hence, as he is said to
   be "the [159] wisdom of God," and to be "made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us wisdom;" so the
   design of God, which is carried along in him, and revealed in the
   gospel, is called "the wisdom of God," and a "mystery; even the hidden
   wisdom which God ordained before the world was; which none of the
   princes of this world knew," <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.7-1Cor.2.8">1 Corinthians 2:7-8</reference> <reference osisRef="Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:10</reference>, it is
   called, "The manifold wisdom of God;" and to discover the depth and
   riches of this wisdom, he tells us in that verse that it is such, that
   principalities and powers, that very angels themselves, could not in
   the least measure get any acquaintance with it, until God, by gathering
   of a church of sinners, did actually discover it. Hence Peter informs
   us, that they who are so well acquainted with all the works of God, do
   yet bow down and desire with earnestness to look into these things (the
   things of the wisdom of God in the gospel), <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference> It asks a man
   much wisdom to make a curious work, fabric, and building; but if one
   shall come and deface it, to raise up the same building to more beauty
   and glory than ever, this is excellence of wisdom indeed. God in the
   beginning made all things good, glorious, and beautiful. When all
   things had an innocence and beauty, the clear impress [160] of his
   wisdom and goodness upon them, they were very glorious; especially man,
   who was made for his special glory. Now, all this beauty was defaced by
   sin, and the whole [161] creation rolled up in darkness, wrath, curses,
   confusion, and the great praise of God buried in the heaps of it. Man,
   especially, was utterly lost, and came short of the glory of God, for
   which he was created, <reference osisRef="Rom.3.23">Romans 3:23</reference> Here, now, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the depth of the
   riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God open itself. A design in
   Christ shines out from his bosom, that was lodged there from eternity,
   to recover things to such an estate as shall be exceedingly to the
   advantage of his glory, infinitely above what at first appeared, and
   for the putting of sinners into inconceivably a better condition than
   they were in before the entrance of sin. He appears now glorious; he is
   known to be a God [162] pardoning iniquity and sin, and advances the
   riches of his grace: which was his design, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.6">Ephesians 1:6</reference> He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   infinitely vindicated his justice also, in the face of men, angels, and
   devils, in setting forth his Son for a [163] propitiation. It is also
   to our advantage; we are more fully established in his favour, and are
   carried on towards a more exceeding [164] weight of glory than formerly
   was revealed. Hence was that ejaculation of one of the ancients, "O
   felix culpa, quae talem meruit redemptorem!" Thus Paul tells us, "Great
   is the mystery of godliness," <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>, and that "without
   controversy." We receive "grace for grace;" [165] -- for that grace
   lost in Adam, better grace in Christ. Confessedly, this is a depth of
   wisdom indeed. And of the love of Christ to his church, and his union
   with it, to carry on this business, "This is a great mystery," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.32">Ephesians 5:32</reference>, says the apostle; great wisdom lies in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   So, then, this also is hid in Christ, -- the great and unspeakable
   riches of the wisdom of God, in pardoning sin, saving sinners,
   satisfying justice, fulfilling the law, repairing his own honour, and
   providing for us a more exceeding weight of glory; and all this out of
   such a condition as in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it was impossible that it should enter into
   the hearts of angels or men how ever the glory of God should be
   repaired, and one sinning creature delivered from everlasting ruin.
   Hence it is said, that at the last day God "shall be glorified in his
   saints, and admired in all them that believe," <reference osisRef="2Thess.1.10">2 Thessalonians 1:10</reference> It shall
   be an admirable thing, and God shall be for ever glorious in it, even
   in the bringing of believers to himself. To save sinners through
   believing, shall be found to be a far more admirable work than to
   create the world of nothing.
				</p><p>
   [4.] His all-sufficiency is the last of this sort that I shall name.
				</p><p>
   God's all-sufficiency in himself is his absolute and universal
   perfection, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> nothing is wanting in him, nothing to him: No
   accession can be made to his fulness, no decrease or wasting can happen
   to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. There is also in him an all-sufficiency for others; which is
   his power to impart and communicate his goodness and himself so to them
   as to satisfy and fill them, in their utmost capacity, with whatever is
   good and desirable to them. For the first of these, -- his
   all-sufficiency for the communication of his goodness, that is, in the
   outward effect of it, -- God abundantly manifested in the creation, in
   that he made all things good, all things perfect; that is, to whom
   nothing was wanting in their own kind; -- he put a stamp of his own
   goodness upon them all. But now for the latter, -- his giving himself
   as an all-sufficient God, to be enjoyed by the creatures, to hold out
   all that is in him for the satiating and making them blessed, -- that
   is alone discovered by and in Christ. In him he is a Father, a God in
   covenant, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised to lay out himself for them; in him
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he promised to give himself into their everlasting fruition, as
   their exceeding great reward.
				</p><p>
   And so I have insisted on the second sort of properties in God,
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>, though we have some obscure glimpse in other things, yet the
   clear knowledge of them, and acquaintance with them, is only to be had
   in the Lord Christ.
				</p><p>
   That which remains<note n="remaineth">Auto-modernized</note> is, briefly to declare that not any of the
   properties of God whatever can be known, savingly and to consolation,
   but only in him; and so, consequently, all the wisdom of the knowledge
   of God is hid in him alone, and from him to be obtained.
				</p><p>
   2. There is no saving knowledge of any property of God, nor such as
   brings consolation, but what alone is to be had in Christ Jesus, being
   laid up in him, and manifested by him. Some eye the justice of God, and
   know that this is his righteousness, "that they which do such things"
   (as sin) "are worthy of death," <reference osisRef="Rom.1.32">Romans 1:32</reference> But this is to no other end
   but to make them cry, "Who amongst us shall dwell with the devouring
   fire?" <reference osisRef="Isa.33.14">Isaiah 33:14</reference> Others fix upon his patience, goodness, mercy,
   forbearance; but it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not at all lead them to repentance; but "they
   despise the riches of his goodness, and after their hardness and
   impenitent hearts treasure up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves wrath against the day of
   wrath," <reference osisRef="Rom.2.4-Rom.2.5">Romans 2:4-5</reference> Others, by the very works of creation and
   providence, come to know "his eternal power and Godhead; but they
   glorify him not as God, nor are thankful, but become vain in their
   imagination, and their foolish hearts are darkened," <reference osisRef="Rom.1.20">Romans 1:20</reference>
   Whatever discovery men have of truth out of Christ, they "hold it
   captive under unrighteousness," verse 18. Hence Jude tells us, verse
   10, that "in what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
   they corrupt themselves."
				</p><p>
   That we may have a saving knowledge of the properties of God, attended
   with consolation, these three things are required:  (1.) That God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   manifested the glory of them all in a way of doing good to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. (2.)
   That he will yet exercise and lay them out to the utmost in our behalf.
   (3.) That, being so manifested and exercised, they are fit and powerful
   to bring us to the everlasting fruition of himself; which is our
   blessedness. Now, all these three lie hid in Christ; and the least
   glimpse of them out of him is not to be attained.
				</p><p>
   (1.) This is to be received, that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> actually manifested the
   glory of all his attributes in a way of doing us good. What will it
   avail our souls, what comfort will it bring to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, what endearment
   will it put upon our hearts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, to know that he is infinitely
   righteous, just, and holy, unchangeably true and faithful, if we know
   not how he may preserve the glory of his justice and faithfulness in
   his comminations and threatenings, but only in our ruin and
   destruction? if we can from thence only say it is a righteous thing
   with him to recompense tribulation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us for our iniquities? What
   fruit of this consideration had Adam in the garden? Gen. iii. What
   sweetness, what encouragement, is there in knowing that he is patient
   and full of forbearance, if the glory of these is to be exalted in
   enduring the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction? nay, what will it
   avail us to hear him proclaim himself "The Lord, The Lord God, [166]
   merciful and gracious, abundant in goodness and truth," yet, withal,
   that he will "by no means clear the guilty," -- so shutting up the
   exercise of all his other properties towards us, upon the account of
   our iniquity? Doubtless, not at all. Under this naked consideration of
   the properties of God, justice will make men fly and hide, Gen. iii.;
   <reference osisRef="Isa.2.21">Isaiah 2:21</reference>, xxxiii. 15, 16; -- patience, render them obdurate, <reference osisRef="Eccl.8.11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</reference> Holiness utterly deters them from all thoughts of approach
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, <reference osisRef="Josh.24.19">Joshua 24:19</reference> What relief have we from thoughts of his
   immensity and omnipresence, if we have cause only to contrive how to
   fly from him (<reference osisRef="Ps.139.11-Ps.139.12">Psalms 139:11-12</reference>), if we have no pledge of his gracious
   presence with us? This is that which brings salvation, when we shall
   see that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> glorified all his properties in a way of doing us
   good. Now, this he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done in Jesus Christ. In him has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he made his
   justice glorious, in making all our iniquities to [167] meet upon him,
   causing him to bear them all, as the scape-goat in the wilderness; not
   sparing him, but giving him up to death for us all; -- so exalting his
   justice and indignation against sin in a way of freeing us from the
   condemnation of it, <reference osisRef="Rom.3.25">Romans 3:25</reference>, viii. 33, 34. In him has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he made his
   truth glorious, and his faithfulness, in the exact accomplishment of
   all his absolute threatenings and promises. That fountain-threat and
   commination from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> all others flow, <reference osisRef="Gen.2.17">Genesis 2:17</reference>, "In the day you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note>
   eatest of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt die the death;" seconded with a curse, <reference osisRef="Deut.27.26">Deuteronomy 27:26</reference>, "Cursed is every one that continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> not," etc. [<reference osisRef="Gal.3.10">Galatians 3:10</reference>] -- is in him accomplished, fulfilled, and the truth of God in them
   laid in a way to our good. He, by the grace of God, tasted death for
   us, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.9">Hebrews 2:9</reference>; and so delivered us who were subject to death, verse
   15; and he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> fulfilled the curse, by being made a curse for us, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference> So that in his very threatenings his truth is made glorious in
   a way to our good. And for his promises, "They are all yea, and in him
   Amen, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God by us," <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.20">2 Corinthians 1:20</reference> And for his mercy,
   goodness, and the riches of his grace, how eminently are they made
   glorious in Christ, and advanced for our good! God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> set him forth
   to declare his righteousness for the forgiveness of sin; he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made
   way in him for ever to exalt the glory of his pardoning mercy towards
   sinners. To manifest this is the great design of the gospel, as Paul
   admirably sets it out, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.5-Eph.1.8">Ephesians 1:5-8</reference> There must our souls come to an
   acquaintance with them, or for ever live in darkness.
				</p><p>
   Now, this is a saving knowledge, and full of consolation, when we can
   see all the properties of God made glorious and exalted in a way of
   doing us good. And this wisdom is hid only in Jesus Christ. Hence, when
   he desired his Father to glorify his name, <reference osisRef="John.12.24">John 12:24</reference>, -- to make in
   him his name (that is, his nature, his properties, his will) all
   glorious in that work of redemption he had in hand, -- he was instantly
   answered from heaven, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it
   again." He will give it its utmost glory in him.
				</p><p>
   (2.) That God will yet exercise and lay out those properties of his to
   the utmost in our behalf. Though he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made them all glorious in a
   way that may tend to our good, yet it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not absolutely follow that
   he will use them for our good; for do we not see innumerable persons
   perishing everlastingly, notwithstanding the manifestation of himself
   which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made in Christ. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> farther, God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> committed
   all his properties into the hand of Christ if I may so say, to be
   managed in our behalf, and for our good. He [168] is "The power of God,
   and the wisdom of God;" he is "The Lord our Righteousness," and is
   "made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us of God wisdom, and righteousness, sanctification, and
   redemption." Christ having glorified his Father in all his attributes,
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> now the exercise of them committed to him, that he might be the
   captain of salvation to them that do believe; so that if, in the
   righteousness, the goodness, the love, the mercy, the all-sufficiency
   of God, there be any thing that will do us good, the Lord Jesus is
   fully interested with the dispensing of it in our behalf. Hence God is
   said to be "in him, reconciling the world to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.18">2 Corinthians 5:18</reference>
   Whatever is in him, he lays<note n="layeth">Auto-modernized</note> it out for the reconciliation of the
   world, in and by the Lord Christ; and he becomes "The Lord our
   Righteousness," <reference osisRef="Isa.45.24-Isa.45.25">Isaiah 45:24-25</reference> And this is the second thing
   required.
				</p><p>
   (3.) There remains<note n="remaineth">Auto-modernized</note> only, then, that these attributes of God, so
   manifested and exercised, are powerful and able to bring us to the
   everlasting fruition of him. To evince this, the Lord wraps up the
   whole covenant of grace in one promise, signifying no less: "I will be
   your God." In the covenant, God becomes our God, and we are his people;
   and thereby all his attributes are ours also. And lest that we should
   doubt -- when once our eyes are opened to see in any measure the
   inconceivable difficulty that is in this thing, what unimaginable
   obstacles on all hands there lie against us -- that all is not enough
   to deliver and save us, God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, I say, wrapped it up in this
   expression, <reference osisRef="Gen.17.1">Genesis 17:1</reference>, "I am," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, [169] "God Almighty"
   (all-sufficient); -- "I am wholly able to perform all my undertakings,
   and to be your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> exceeding great reward. I can remove all difficulties,
   answer all objections, pardon all sins, conquer all opposition: I am
   God all-sufficient." Now, you know in whom this covenant and all the
   promises of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> are ratified, and in whose blood it is confirmed, --
   to wit, in the Lord Christ alone; in him only is God an all-sufficient
   God to any, and an exceeding great reward. And hence Christ himself is
   said to "save to the uttermost them that come to God by him," Heb. vii.
   And these three things, I say, are required to be known, that we may
   have a saving acquaintance, and such as is attended with consolation,
   with any of the properties of God; and all these being hid only in
   Christ, from him alone it is to be obtained.
				</p><p>
   This, then, is the first part of our first demonstration, -- that all
   true and sound wisdom and knowledge is laid up in the Lord Christ, and
   from him alone to be obtained; because our wisdom, consisting, in a
   main part of it, in the knowledge of God, his nature, and his
   properties, this lies wholly hid in Christ, nor can possibly be
   obtained but by him.
				</p><p>
   II. For the knowledge of ourselves, which is the second part of our
   [170] wisdom, this consists in these three things, which our Saviour
   sends his Spirit to convince the world of, -- even "sin, righteousness,
   and judgment," <reference osisRef="John.16.8">John 16:8</reference> To know ourselves in reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these
   three, is a main part of true and sound wisdom; for they all respect
   the supernatural and immortal end to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> we are appointed; and there
   is none of these that we can attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> but only in Christ.
				</p><p>
   1. In respect of sin. There is a sense and knowledge of sin left in the
   consciences of all men by nature. To tell them what is good and evil in
   many things, to approve and disapprove of what they do, in reference to
   a judgment to come, they need not go farther than themselves, <reference osisRef="Rom.2.14-Rom.2.15">Romans 2:14-15</reference> But this is obscure, and relates mostly to greater sins, and is
   in sum that which the apostle gives us, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.32">Romans 1:32</reference>, "They know the
   judgment of God, that they which do such things are worthy of death."
   This he places<note n="placeth">Auto-modernized</note> among the common presumptions and notions that are
   received by mankind, -- namely, that it is [171] "righteous with God,
   that they who do such things are worthy of death." And if that be true,
   which is commonly received, that no nation is so barbarous or rude, but
   it retains<note n="retaineth">Auto-modernized</note> some sense of a Deity; then this also is true, that there
   is no nation but has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a sense of sin, and the displeasure of God for
   it. For this is the very first [172] notion of God in the world, that
   he is the rewarder of good and evil. Hence were all the sacrifices,
   purgings, expiations, which were so generally spread over the face of
   the earth. But this was and is but very dark, in respect of that
   knowledge of sin with its appurtenances, which is to be obtained.
				</p><p>
   A farther knowledge of sin, upon all accounts whatever, is giver by the
   law; that law which was "added because of transgressions." This [173]
   revives doctrinally all that sense of good and evil which was at first
   implanted in man; and it is a glass, into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> whosoever is able
   spiritually to look, may see sin in all its ugliness and deformity. The
   truth is, look upon the law in its purity, holiness, compass, and
   perfection; its manner of delivery, [174] with dread, terror, thunder,
   earthquakes, fire; the sanction of it, in death, curse, wrath; and it
   makes a wonderful discovery of sin, upon every account: its pollution,
   guilt, and exceeding sinfulness are seen by it. But yet all this does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   not suffice to give a man a true and thorough conviction of sin. Not
   but that the glass is clear, but of ourselves we have not eyes to look
   into it; the rule is straight, but we cannot apply it: and therefore
   Christ sends his Spirit to convince the world of sin, <reference osisRef="John.16.8">John 16:8</reference>; who,
   though, as to some ends and purposes, he makes use of the law, yet the
   work of conviction, which alone is a useful knowledge of sin, is his
   peculiar work. And so the discovery of sin may also be said to be by
   Christ, -- to be part of the wisdom that is hid in him. But yet there
   is a twofold regard besides this, of his sending his Spirit to convince
   us, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this wisdom appears to be hid in him:  First, because
   there are some near concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of sin, which are more clearly held
   out in the Lord Christ's being made sin for us, than any other way.
   Secondly, in that there is no knowledge to be had of sin, so as to give
   it a spiritual and saving improvement, but only in him.
				</p><p>
   For the first, there are four things in sin that clearly shine out in
   the cross of Christ:  (1.) The desert of it. (2.) Man's impotency by
   reason of it. (3.) The death of it. (4.) A new end put to it.
				</p><p>
   (1.) The desert of sin does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> clearly shine in the cross of Christ upon a
   twofold account:  [1.] Of the person suffering for it. [2.] Of the
   penalty he underwent.
				</p><p>
   [1.] Of the person suffering for it. This the Scripture oftentimes very
   emphatically sets forth, and lays great weight upon: <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference>, "God
   so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son." It was his
   only Son that God sent into the world to suffer for sin, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.32">Romans 8:32</reference>
   "He spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all." To see a
   slave beaten and corrected, it argues a fault committed; but yet
   perhaps the demerit of it was not very great. The correction of a son
   argues a great provocation; that of an only son, the greatest
   imaginable. Never was sin seen to be more abominably sinful and full of
   provocation, than when the burden of it was upon the shoulders of the
   Son of God. God having made his Son, the Son of his love, his only
   begotten, full of grace and truth, [175] sin for us, to manifest his
   indignation against it, and how utterly impossible it is that he should
   let the least sin go unpunished, he lays [176] hand on him, and spares
   him not. If [177] sin be imputed to the dear Son of his bosom, as upon
   his own voluntary assumption of it it was (for he said to his Father,
   "Lo, I come to do your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> will," and all our iniquities did meet on him),
   [and] he will not spare him any thing of the due desert of it; is it
   not most clear from hence, even from the blood of the cross of Christ,
   that such is the demerit of sin, that it is altogether impossible that
   God should pass by any, the least, unpunished? If he would have done it
   for any, he would have done it in reference to his only Son; but he
   spared him not.
				</p><p>
   Moreover, God is not at all delighted with, nor desirous of, the blood,
   the tears, the cries, the inexpressible torments and sufferings, of the
   Son of his love (for he delights not in the anguish of any, -- "he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   not [178] afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men," much less
   the Son of his bosom); only he required that his law be fulfilled, his
   justice satisfied, his wrath atoned for sin; and nothing less than all
   this would bring it about. If the debt of sin might have been
   compounded for at a cheaper rate, it had never been held up at the
   price of the blood of Christ. Here, then, soul, take a view of the
   desert of sin; behold it far more evident than in all the threatenings
   and curses of the law. "I thought, indeed," mayest you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> say from
   thence, "that sin, being found on such a poor worm as I am, was worthy
   of death; but that it should have this effect if charged on the Son of
   God, -- that I never once imagined."
				</p><p>
   [2.] Consider also, farther, what he suffered. For though he was so
   excellent a one, yet perhaps it was but a light affliction and trial
   that he underwent, especially considering the strength he had to bear
   it. Why, whatever it were, it made this [179] "fellow of the Lord of
   hosts," this [180] "lion of the tribe of Judah," this [181] "mighty
   one," "the [182] wisdom and power of God," to tremble, [183] sweat,
   cry, pray, wrestle, and that with strong supplications. Some of the
   popish devotionists tell us that one drop, the least, of the blood of
   Christ, was abundantly enough to redeem all the world; but they err,
   not knowing the desert of sin, nor the severity of the justice of God.
   If one drop less than was shed, one pang less than was laid on, would
   have done it, those other drops had not been shed, nor those other
   pangs laid on. God did not cruciate the dearly-beloved of his soul for
   nought. But there is more than all this: 
				</p><p>
   It pleased God to [184] bruise him, to put him to grief, to make his
   soul an offering for sin, and to pour out his life to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death. He [185]
   hid himself from him, -- was far from the voice of his cry, until he
   cried out, "My God, my God, why have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> forsaken me?" He made him
   [186] sin and a [187] curse for us; executed on him the sentence of the
   law; brought him into an agony, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he sweat thick drops of blood,
   was grievously troubled, and his soul was heavy to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death. He that was
   the power of God, and the wisdom of God, went stooping under the
   burden, until the whole frame of nature seemed astonished at it. Now
   this, as I said before that it discovered the indignation of God
   against sin, so it clearly holds out the desert of it. Would you, then,
   see the true demerit of sin? -- take the measure of it from the
   mediation of Christ, especially his cross. It brought him who was the
   Son of God, equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, God blessed for ever, into the form of a
   [188] servant, who had not where to lay his head. It pursued him all
   his life with afflictions and persecutions; and lastly brought him
   under the rod of God; there bruised him and brake him, -- [189] slew
   the Lord of life. Hence is deep humiliation for it, upon the account of
   him whom we [190] have pierced. And this is the first spiritual view of
   sin we have in Christ.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The wisdom of understanding our impotency, by reason of sin, is
   wrapped up in him. By our impotency, I understand two things:  [1.]
   Our disability to make any atonement with God for sin. [2.] Our
   disability to answer his mind and will, in all or any of the obedience
   that he requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>, by reason of sin.
				</p><p>
   [1.] For the first, that alone is discovered in Christ. Many inquiries
   have the sons of men made after an atonement, -- many ways have they
   entered into to accomplish it. After this they inquire, <reference osisRef="Mic.6.6-Mic.6.7">Micah 6:6-7</reference>,
   "Will any manner of sacrifices, though appointed of God, as
   burnt-offerings, and calves of a year old; though very costly,
   thousands of rams, and ten thousand rivers of oil; though dreadful and
   tremendous, offering violence to nature, as to give my children to the
   fire;" -- will any of these things make an atonement? David does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   positively, indeed, determine this business, <reference osisRef="Ps.49.7-Ps.49.8">Psalms 49:7-8</reference>, "None of
   them" (of the best or richest of men) "can by any means redeem his
   brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; for the redemption of their
   soul is precious, and it ceases<note n="ceaseth">Auto-modernized</note> for ever." It cannot be done, -- no
   atonement can be made; yet men would still be doing, still attempting:
   hence did they heap up [191] sacrifices, some costly, some bloody and
   inhuman. The Jews, to this day, think that God was atoned for sin by
   the sacrifices of bulls and goats, and the like. And the Socinians
   acknowledge no atonement, but what consists in men's repentance and new
   obedience. In the cross of Christ are the mouths of all stopped as to
   this thing. For, --
				</p><p>
   1st. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> there discovered that no sacrifices for sin, though of
   his own appointment, could ever make them perfect that offered them,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.10.11">Hebrews 10:11</reference> Those sacrifices could never take away sin; [192] -- those
   services could never make them perfect that performed them, as to the
   conscience, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.9">Hebrews 9:9</reference>; as the apostle proves, chap. x. 1. And thence
   the Lord rejects all sacrifices and offerings whatever, as to any such
   end and purpose, verses 6-8, Christ, in their stead, saying, "Lo, I
   come;" and by him we are "justified from all things, from which we
   could not be justified by the law," <reference osisRef="Acts.13.39">Acts 13:39</reference>: God, I say, in
   Christ, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> condemned all sacrifices, as wholly insufficient in the
   least to make an atonement for sin. And how great a thing it was to
   instruct the sons of men in this wisdom, the event has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested.
				</p><p>
   2dly. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> also written vanity on all other endeavours whatever,
   that have been undertaken for that purpose. <reference osisRef="Rom.3.24-Rom.3.26">Romans 3:24-26</reference>, by setting
   forth his only Son "to be a propitiation," he leaves no doubt upon the
   spirits of men that in themselves they could make no atonement; for "if
   righteousness were by the law, then were Christ dead in vain." To what
   purpose should he be made a propitiation, were not we ourselves weak
   and without strength to any such purpose? So the apostle argues, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.6">Romans 5:6</reference>, when we had no power, then did he by death make an atonement; as
   verses 8, 9.
				</p><p>
   This, wisdom then, is also hid in Christ. Men may see by other helps,
   perhaps, far enough to fill them with dread and astonishment, as those
   in <reference osisRef="Isa.33.14">Isaiah 33:14</reference>; but such a sight and view of it as may lead a soul
   to any comfortable settlement about it, -- that only is discovered in
   this treasury of heaven, the Lord Jesus.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Our disability to answer the mind and will of God, in all or any
   of the obedience that he requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>, is in him only to be discovered.
   This, indeed, is a thing that many will not be acquainted with to this
   day. To teach a man that he cannot do what he ought to do, and for
   which he condemns himself if he do it not, is no easy task. Man rises
   up with all his power to plead against a conviction of impotency. Not
   to mention the proud [193] conceits and expressions of the
   philosophers, how many that would be called Christians do yet creep, by
   several degrees, in the persuasion of a power of fulfilling the law!
   And from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>, indeed, should men have this knowledge that we have
   not? Nature will not teach it, -- that is [194] proud and conceited;
   and it is one part of its pride, weakness, and corruption, not to know
   it at all. The law will not teach it: for though that will show us what
   we have done amiss, yet it will not discover to us that we could not do
   better; yea, by requiring exact obedience of us, it takes for granted
   that such power is in us for that purpose: it takes no notice that we
   have lost it; nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it concern it so to do. This, then, also lies
   hid in the Lord Jesus. <reference osisRef="Rom.8.2-Rom.8.4">Romans 8:2-4</reference>, "The law of the Spirit of life
   in Christ Jesus has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made me free from the law of sin and death. For
   what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
   sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
   condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law might be
   fulfilled in us." The law can bring forth no righteousness, no
   obedience; it is weak to any such purpose, by reason of the flesh, and
   that corruption that is come on us. These two things are done in
   Christ, and by him:  First, Sin is condemned as to its guilt, and we
   set free from that; the righteousness of the law by his obedience is
   fulfilled in us, who could never do it ourselves. And, secondly, That
   obedience which is required of us, his Spirit works it in us. So that
   that perfection of obedience which we have in him is imputed to us; and
   the sincerity that we have in obedience is from his Spirit bestowed on
   us. And this is the most excellent glass, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we see our impotency;
   for what need we his perfect obedience to be made ours, but that we
   have not, can not attain any? what need we his Spirit of life to
   quicken us, but that we are dead in trespasses and sins?
				</p><p>
   (3.) The death of sin; -- sin dying in us now, in some measure, while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note>
   we are alive. This is a third concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of sin which it is our wisdom
   to be acquainted with; and it is hid only in Christ. There is a twofold
   dying of sin:  as to the exercise of it in our mortal members; and as
   to the root, principle, and power of it in our souls. The first,
   indeed, may be learned in part out of Christ. Christless men may have
   sin dying in them, as to the outward exercise of it. Men's bodies may
   be disabled for the service of their lusts, or the practice of them may
   not consist with their interest. Sin is never more alive [195] than
   when it is thus dying. But there is a dying of it as to the root, the
   principle of it, -- the daily decaying of the strength, power, and life
   of it; and this is to be had alone in Christ. Sin is a thing that of
   itself is not apt to die or to decay, but to get ground, and strength,
   and life, in the subject in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is, to eternity; prevent all its
   actual eruptions, yet its original enmity against God will still grow.
   In believers it is still dying and decaying, until it be utterly
   abolished. The opening of this treasury [mystery?] you have, <reference osisRef="Rom.6.3-Rom.6.6">Romans 6:3-6</reference>, etc. "Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptised into Jesus
   Christ were baptised into his death? Therefore we are buried with him
   by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by
   the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of
   life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
   death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection; knowing
   this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin
   might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin." This is
   the design of the apostle in the beginning of that chapter, not only to
   manifest from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is the principle and rise of our mortification and the
   death of sin, even from the death and blood of Christ; but also the
   manner of sin's continuance and dying in us, from the manner of
   Christ's dying for sin. He was crucified for us, and thereby sin was
   crucified in us; he died for us, and the body of sin is destroyed, that
   we should not serve sin; and as he was raised from the dead, that death
   should not have dominion over him, so also are we raised from sin, that
   it should not have dominion over us. This wisdom is hid in Christ only.
   Moses at his dying day had all his strength and vigour; so have sin and
   the law to all out of Jesus: at their dying day, sin is no way decayed.
   Now, next to the receiving of the righteousness prepared for us, to
   know this is the chiefest part of our wisdom. To be truly acquainted
   with the principle of the dying of sin, to feel virtue and power
   flowing from the cross of Christ to that purpose, to find sin crucified
   in us, as Christ was crucified for us, -- this is wisdom indeed, that
   is in him alone.
				</p><p>
   (4.) There is a glorious end to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> sin is appointed and ordained,
   and discovered in Christ, that others are unacquainted withal. Sin in
   its own nature tends merely to the dishonour of God, the debasement of
   his majesty, and the ruin of the creature in whom it is; hell itself is
   but the filling of wretched creatures with the [196] fruit of their own
   devices. The comminations and threats of God in the law do manifest one
   other end of it, even the demonstration of the vindictive justice of
   God, in measuring out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it a meet [197] recompense of reward. But
   here the law stays (and with it all other light) and discovers no other
   use or end of it at all. In the Lord Jesus there is the manifestation
   of another and more glorious end; to wit, the praise of God's glorious
   [198] grace in the pardon and forgiveness of it; -- God having taken
   order in Christ that that thing which tended merely to his dishonour
   should be managed to his infinite glory, and that which of all things
   he desires<note n="desireth">Auto-modernized</note> to exalt, -- even that he may be known and believed to be a
   [199] "God pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin." To return, then,
   to this part of our demonstration: 
				</p><p>
   In the knowledge of ourselves, in reference to our eternal condition,
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> much of our wisdom consist. There is not any thing in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, in
   this depraved condition of nature, we are more concerned than sin;
   without a knowledge of that, we know not ourselves. "Fools make a mock
   of sin." A true saving knowledge of sin is to be had only in the Lord
   Christ: in him may we see the desert of our iniquities, and their
   pollution, which could not be borne or expiated but by his blood;
   neither is there any wholesome view of these but in Christ. In him and
   his cross is discovered our universal impotency, either of atoning
   God's justice or living up to his will. The death of sin is procured
   by, and discovered in, the death of Christ; as also the manifestation
   of the riches of God's grace in the pardoning of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. A real and
   experimental acquaintance, as to ourselves, with all which, is our
   wisdom; and it is that which is of more value than all the wisdom of
   the world.
				</p><p>
   2. Righteousness is a second thing of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the Spirit of Christ
   convinces the world, and the main thing that it is our wisdom to be
   acquainted withal. This all men are persuaded of, that God is a most
   righteous God; (that is a natural notion of God which Abraham insisted
   on, <reference osisRef="Gen.18.25">Genesis 18:25</reference>, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?")
   they "know that this is the judgment of God, that they who commit such
   things are worthy of death," <reference osisRef="Rom.1.32">Romans 1:32</reference>; that "it is a righteous thing
   with him to recompense tribulation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> offenders," <reference osisRef="2Thess.1.6">2 Thessalonians 1:6</reference> He
   is "a God of purer eyes than to behold evil," <reference osisRef="Hab.1.13">Habakkuk 1:13</reference>; and
   therefore, "the ungodly cannot stand in judgment," <reference osisRef="Ps.1.5">Psalms 1:5</reference> Hence the
   great inquiry of every one (who lies in any measure under the power of
   it), convinced of immortality and the judgment to come, is concerning
   the righteousness with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> to appear in the presence of this righteous
   God. This more or less they are solicitous about all their days; and
   so, as the apostle speaks, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.15">Hebrews 2:15</reference>, "through the fear of death they
   are all their lifetime subject to bondage," -- they are perplexed with
   fears about the issue of their righteousness, lest it should end in
   death and destruction.
				</p><p>
   (1.) To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men set upon this inquiry, that which first and naturally
   presents itself, for their direction and assistance, assuredly
   promising them a righteousness that will abide the trial of God,
   provided they will follow its direction, is the law. The law has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> many
   fair pleas to prevail with a soul to close with it for a righteousness
   before God. It was given out from God himself for that end and purpose;
   it contains the whole obedience that God requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> of any of the sons
   of men; it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the promise of life annexed to it: "Do this, and live,"
   "The doers of the law are justified;" and, "If you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> enter into
   life, keep the commandments;" -- yea, it is most certain that it must
   be wholly fulfilled, if we ever think to stand with boldness before
   God. This being some part of the plea of the law, there is no man that
   seeks after righteousness but does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, one time or another, attend to it,
   and attempt its direction. Many do it every day, who yet will not own
   that so they do. This, then, they set themselves about, -- labouring to
   correct their lives, amend their ways, perform the duties required, and
   so follow after a righteousness according to the prescript of the law.
   And in this course do many men continue long with much perplexity; --
   sometimes hoping, oftener fearing; sometimes ready to give quite over;
   sometimes vowing to continue (their consciences being no way satisfied,
   nor righteousness in any measure attained) all their days. After they
   have wearied themselves perhaps for a long season, in the largeness of
   their ways, they come at length, with fear, trembling, and
   disappointment, to that conclusion of the apostle, "By the works of the
   law no flesh is justified;" and with dread cry that if God mark what is
   done amiss, there is no standing before him. That they have this issue,
   the apostle witnesses<note n="witnesseth">Auto-modernized</note>, [200] <reference osisRef="Rom.9.31-Rom.9.32">Romans 9:31-32</reference>, "Israel, who followed
   after the law of righteousness, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not attained to the law of
   righteousness. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>? Because they sought it not by faith, but as
   it were by the works of the law." It was not solely for want of
   endeavour in themselves that they were disappointed, for they earnestly
   followed after the law of righteousness; but from the nature of the
   thing itself, -- it would not bear it. Righteousness was not to be
   obtained that way; "For," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle, "if they which are of the
   law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect;
   because the law works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> wrath," <reference osisRef="Rom.4.14-Rom.4.15">Romans 4:14-15</reference> The law itself is now
   such as that it cannot give life, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.21">Galatians 3:21</reference>, "If there had been a
   law given which would have given life, verily righteousness should have
   been by the law." And he gives the reason in the next verse why it
   could not give life; because "the Scripture concludes all under sin;"
   -- that is, it is very true, and the Scripture affirms it, that all men
   are sinners, and the law speaks not one word to sinners but death and
   destruction: therefore the apostle tells us plainly, that God himself
   found fault with this way of attaining righteousness, <reference osisRef="Heb.8.7-Heb.8.8">Hebrews 8:7-8</reference>
   [201] He complains of it; that is, he declares it insufficient for that
   end and purpose.
				</p><p>
   Now, there are two considerations that discover to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men the vanity and
   hopelessness of seeking righteousness in this path: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] That they have already sinned: [202] "For all have sinned, and
   come short of the glory of God," <reference osisRef="Rom.3.23">Romans 3:23</reference> This they are
   sufficiently sensible of, that although they could for the time to come
   fulfil the whole law, yet there is a score, a reckoning, upon them
   already, that they know not how to answer for. Do they consult their
   guide, the [203] law itself, how they may be eased of the account that
   is past? it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not one word of direction or consolation; but bids
   them prepare to die. The sentence is gone forth, and there is no
   escaping.
				</p><p>
   [2.] That if all former debts should be blotted out, yet they are no
   way able for the future to fulfil the law; they can as well move the
   earth with a finger, as answer the perfection of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>: and therefore,
   as I said, on this twofold account, they conclude that this labour is
   lost. [204] "By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
				</p><p>
   (2.) Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, secondly, Being thus disappointed, by the severity and
   inexorableness of the law, men generally betake themselves to some
   other way, that may satisfy them as to those considerations which took
   them off from their former hopes; and this, for the most part, is by
   fixing themselves upon some ways of atonement to satisfy God, and
   helping out the rest with hopes of mercy. Not to insist on the ways of
   atonement and expiation which the Gentiles had pitched on; nor on the
   many ways and inventions -- by works satisfactory of their own,
   supererogations of others, indulgences, and purgatory in the close --
   that the Papists have found out for this end and purpose; it is, I say,
   proper to all convinced persons, as above, to seek for a righteousness,
   partly by an endeavour to satisfy for what is past, and partly by
   hoping after general mercy. This the apostle calls a seeking for it "as
   it were by the works of the law," <reference osisRef="Rom.9.32">Romans 9:32</reference>; [205] not directly, "but
   as it were" by the works of the law, making up one thing with another.
   And he tells us what issue they have in this business, chap. x. 3,
   "Being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish
   their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   righteousness of God." They were by it enemies to the righteousness of
   God. The ground of this going about to establish their own
   righteousness was, that they were ignorant of the righteousness of God.
   Had they known the righteousness of God, and what exact conformity to
   his will he requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>, they had never undertaken such a fruitless
   business as to have compassed it "as it were by the works of the law."
   Yet this many will stick on a long time. Something they do, something
   they hope for; some old faults they will buy off with new obedience.
   And this pacifies their consciences for a season; but when the Spirit
   comes to convince them of righteousness, neither will this hold.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) The matter comes at length to this issue, -- they look upon
   themselves under this twofold qualification; as, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] Sinners, obnoxious to the law of God and the curse of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; so
   that unless that be satisfied, that nothing from thence shall ever be
   laid to their charge, it is altogether in vain once to seek after an
   appearance in the presence of God.
				</p><p>
   [2.] As creatures made to a supernatural and eternal end; and therefore
   bound to answer the whole mind and will of God in the obedience
   required at their hands. Now, it being before discovered to them that
   both these are beyond the compass of their own endeavours, and the
   assistance which they have formerly rested on, if their eternal
   condition be of any concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> to them, their wisdom is, to find out a
   righteousness that may answer both these to the utmost.
				</p><p>
   Now, both these are to be had only in the Lord Christ, who is our
   righteousness. This wisdom, and all the treasures of it, are hid in
   him.

   1st. He expiates former iniquities, he satisfies for sin, and procures
   remission of it. <reference osisRef="Rom.3.24-Rom.3.25">Romans 3:24-25</reference>, "Being justified freely by his
   grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare
   his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
   forbearance of God." "All we like sheep," etc., <reference osisRef="Isa.53.6">Isaiah 53:6</reference> "Through
   his blood we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.7">Ephesians 1:7</reference> "God
   spared not his own Son, but delivered," etc., <reference osisRef="Rom.8.32">Romans 8:32</reference> This, even
   this alone, is our righteousness; as to that first part of it which
   consists in the removal of the whole guilt of sin, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are come
   short of the glory of God. On this account it is that we are assured
   that none shall ever lay any thing to our charge, or condemn us, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.33-Rom.8.34">Romans 8:33-34</reference>, -- there being "no condemnation to them that are in
   Christ Jesus," verse 1. We are purged by the sacrifice of Christ, so as
   to have "no more conscience of sin," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.2">Hebrews 10:2</reference>; that is, troubles in
   conscience about it. This wisdom is hid only in the Lord Jesus; in him
   alone is there an atonement discovered: and give me the wisdom which
   shall cut all scores concerning sin, and let the world take what
   remains. But, --
				</p><p>
   2dly. There is yet something more required; it is not enough that we
   are not guilty, we must also be actually righteous; -- not only all sin
   is to be answered for, but all righteousness is to be fulfilled. By
   taking away the guilt of sin, we are as persons innocent; but something
   more is required to make us to be considered as persons obedient. I
   know nothing to teach me that an innocent person shall go to heaven, be
   rewarded, if he be no more but so. Adam was innocent at his first
   creation, but he was to "do this," to "keep the commandments," before
   he entered into "life:" he had no title to life by innocence. This,
   then, moreover, is required, that the whole law be fulfilled, and all
   the obedience performed that God requires at our hands. This is the
   soul's second inquiry; and it finds a resolution only in the Lord
   Christ: "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his
   life," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.10">Romans 5:10</reference> His death reconciled us; then are we saved by his
   life. The actual obedience which he yielded to the whole law of God, is
   that righteousness through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are saved; if so be we are found in him,
   not having on our own righteousness which is of the law, but the
   righteousness which is of God by faith, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.9">Philippians 3:9</reference> This I shall have
   occasion to handle more at large hereafter.
				</p><p>
   To return, then: It is not, I suppose, any difficult task to persuade
   men, convinced of immortality and judgment to come, that the main of
   their wisdom lies in this, even to find out such a righteousness as
   will accompany them for ever, and abide the severe trial of God
   himself. Now, all the wisdom of the world is but folly, as to the
   discovery of this thing. The utmost that man's wisdom can do, is but to
   find out most wretched, burdensome, and vexatious ways of perishing
   eternally. All the treasures of this wisdom are hid in Christ; he "of
   God is made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us wisdom and righteousness," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference>
				</p><p>
   3. Come we to the last thing, which I shall but touch upon; and that is
   judgment. The true wisdom of this also is hid in the Lord Christ; I
   mean, in particular, that judgment that is for to come: so at present I
   take the word in that place, [<reference osisRef="John.16.8">John 16:8</reference>] Of what concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> this is
   to us to know, I shall not speak; -- it is that whose [206] influence
   upon the sons of men is the principle of their discriminating
   themselves from the beasts that perish. Neither shall I insist on the
   [207] obscure intimations of it which are given by the present
   proceedings of Providence in governing the world; nor that greater
   light of it which shines in the threats and promises of the law. The
   wisdom of it is in two regards hid in the Lord Jesus:  (1.) As to the
   truth of it. (2.) As to the manner of it: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) For the truth of it; and so in and by him it is confirmed, and
   that two ways:  [1.] By his death. [2.] By his resurrection: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] By his death. God, in the death of Christ, punishing and
   condemning sin in the flesh of his own Son, in the sight of men,
   angels, and devils, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given an abundant assurance of a righteous and
   universal judgment to come; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, or upon what account imaginable,
   could he be induced to lay such a load on him, but that he will
   certainly reckon one day with the sons of men for all their works,
   ways, and walkings before him. The death of Christ is a most solemn
   exemplar of the last judgment. Those who own him to be the Son of God,
   will not deny a judgment to come.
				</p><p>
   [2.] By his resurrection. <reference osisRef="Acts.17.31">Acts 17:31</reference>, Pistin paraschon pasin, -- he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given faith and assurance of this thing to all, by raising Christ
   from the dead, having appointed him to be the judge of all; in whom and
   by whom he will judge the world in righteousness. And then, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) And, lastly, for the manner of it: that it shall be by him who
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> loved us, and given himself for us, -- who is himself the
   righteousness that he requires of our hands; and on the other side, by
   him who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been, in his person, grace, ways, worship, servants,
   reviled, despised, contemned by the men of the world; -- which holds
   out unspeakable consolation on the one hand, and terror on the other:
   so that the wisdom of this also is hid in Christ.
				</p><p>
   And this is the second part of our first demonstration. Thus the
   knowledge of ourselves, in reference to our supernatural end, is no
   small portion of our wisdom. The things of the greatest concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>
   to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> are, sin, righteousness, and judgment; the wisdom of all which
   is alone hid in the Lord Jesus: which was to be proved.
				</p><p>
   III. The third part of our wisdom is to walk with God. Now, that one
   may walk with another, six [208] things are required:  1. Agreement.
   2. Acquaintance. 3. A way. 4. Strength. 5. Boldness. 6. An aiming at
   the same end. All these, with the wisdom of them, are hid in the Lord
   Jesus.
				</p><p>
   1. Agreement. The prophet tells us that two cannot walk together unless
   they be agreed, <reference osisRef="Amos.3.3">Amos 3:3</reference> Until agreement be made, there is no
   communion, no walking together. God and man by nature (or while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> man is
   in the state of nature) are at the greatest enmity. He declares nothing
   to us but wrath, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.18">Romans 1:18</reference>; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> we are said to be children of it;
   that is, born obnoxious to it, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.3">Ephesians 2:3</reference>: and while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> we remain in that
   condition, "the wrath of God abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note> on us," <reference osisRef="John.3.36">John 3:36</reference> All the
   discovery that God makes of himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us is, that he is
   inexpressibly provoked; and therefore preparing wrath against the day
   of wrath, and the revelation of his righteous judgment. The day of his
   and sinners' meeting, is called "The day of wrath," <reference osisRef="Rom.2.5-Rom.2.6">Romans 2:5-6</reference>
   Neither do we come short in our enmity against him; yea, we first began
   it, and we continue longest in it. To express this enmity, the apostle
   tells us, that our very minds, the best part of us, are "enmity against
   God," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.7-Rom.8.8">Romans 8:7-8</reference>; and that we neither are, nor will, nor can be,
   subject to him; our enmity manifesting itself by universal rebellion
   against him: whatever we do that seems otherwise, is but hypocrisy or
   flattery; yea, it is a part of this enmity to lessen it. In this state
   the wisdom of walking with God must needs be most remote from the soul.
   He is [209] "light, and in him is no darkness at all;" we are darkness,
   and in us there is no light at all. He is life, a "living God;" we are
   dead, dead sinners, -- dead in trespasses and sin. He is "holiness,"
   and glorious in it; we wholly defiled, -- an abominable thing. He is
   "love;" we full of hatred, -- hating and being hated. Surely this is no
   foundation for agreement, or, upon that, of walking together: nothing
   can be more remote than this frame from such a condition. The
   foundation, then, of this, I say, is laid in Christ, hid in Christ.
   "He," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle, "is our peace; he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made peace" for us,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.2.14-Eph.2.15">Ephesians 2:14-15</reference> He slew the enmity in his own body on the cross, verse
   16.
				</p><p>
   (1.) He takes out of the way the cause of the enmity that was between
   God and us, -- sin and the curse of the law. He makes an end of sin,
   and that by making atonement for iniquity, <reference osisRef="Dan.9.24">Daniel 9:24</reference>; and he blots<note n="blotteth">Auto-modernized</note>
   out the hand-writing of ordinances, <reference osisRef="Col.2.14">Colossians 2:14</reference>, redeeming us from the
   curse, by "being made a curse for us," <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) He destroys him who would continue the enmity, and make the breach
   wider, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference> "Through death he destroyed him that had the power
   of death, that is, the devil;" and, <reference osisRef="Col.2.15">Colossians 2:15</reference>, "spoiled
   principalities and powers."
				</p><p>
   (3.) He made "reconciliation for the sins of the people," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.17">Hebrews 2:17</reference>;
   he made by his blood an atonement with God, to turn away that wrath
   which was due to us, so making peace. Hereupon God is said to be "in
   Christ, reconciling the world to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.19">2 Corinthians 5:19</reference>; -- being
   reconciled himself, verse 18, he lays down the enmity on his part, and
   proceeds to what remains, -- to slay the enmity on our part, that we
   also may be reconciled. And this also, --
				</p><p>
   (4.) He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>; for, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.11">Romans 5:11</reference>, "By our Lord Jesus Christ we do receive
   the atonement," accept of the peace made and tendered, laying down our
   enmity to God; and so confirming an agreement betwixt us in his blood.
   So that "through him we have an access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference>
   Now, the whole wisdom of this agreement, without which there is no
   walking with God, is hid in Christ; out of him God on his part is a
   consuming fire, -- we are as stubble fully dry, yet setting ourselves
   in battle array against that fire: if we are brought together we are
   consumed. All our approachings to him out of Christ are but to our
   detriment; in his blood alone have we this agreement. And let not any
   of us once suppose that we have taken any step in the paths of God with
   him, that any one duty is accepted, that all is not lost as to
   eternity, if we have not done it upon the account of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   2. There is required acquaintance, also, to walking together. Two may
   meet together in the same way, and have no quarrel between them, no
   enmity; but if they are mere strangers one to another, they pass by
   without the least communion together. It does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not suffice that the
   enmity betwixt God and us be taken away; we must also have acquaintance
   given us with him. Our not knowing of him is a great cause and a great
   part of our enmity. Our understandings are "darkened," and we are
   "alienated from the life of God," etc., <reference osisRef="Eph.4.18">Ephesians 4:18</reference> This also, then,
   must be added, if we ever come to walk with God, which is our wisdom.
   And this also is hid in the Lord Christ, and comes forth from him. It
   is true there are sundry other means, as his word and his works, that
   God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given the sons of men, to make a discovery of himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them, and to give them some acquaintance with him, that, as the apostle
   speaks, <reference osisRef="Acts.17.27">Acts 17:27</reference>, "they should seek the Lord, if haply they might
   find him;" but yet, as that knowledge of God which we have by his works
   is but very weak and imperfect, so that which we have by the word, the
   letter of it, by reason of our blindness, is not saving to us if we
   have no other help; for though that be light as the sun in the
   firmament, yet if we have no eyes in our heads, what can it avail us?
   -- no saving acquaintance with him, that may direct us to walk with
   him, can be obtained. This also is hid in the Lord Jesus, and comes
   forth from him, <reference osisRef="1John.5.20">1 John 5:20</reference>, "He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given us an understanding, that
   we should know him that is true;" -- all other light whatever without
   his giving us an understanding, will not do it. He is the true Light,
   which lights<note n="lighteth">Auto-modernized</note> every one that is enlightened, <reference osisRef="John.1.9">John 1:9</reference> He opens our
   understandings that we may understand the Scriptures, <reference osisRef="Luke.24.45">Luke 24:45</reference>; --
   none has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> known God at any time, "but he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> revealed him," <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference> God dwells in that "light which no man can approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="1Tim.6.16">1 Timothy 6:16</reference> None has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ever had any such acquaintance with him as to be said
   to have seen him, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Hence he tells
   the Pharisees, that notwithstanding all their great knowledge which
   they pretended, indeed they had "neither heard the voice of God at any
   time, nor seen his shape," <reference osisRef="John.5.37">John 5:37</reference> They had no manner of spiritual
   acquaintance with God, but he was to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them as a man whom they had
   never heard nor seen. There is no acquaintance with God, as love, and
   full of kindness, patience, grace, and pardoning mercy (on which
   knowledge of him alone we can walk with him), but only in Christ; but
   of this fully before. This, then, also is hid in him.
				</p><p>
   3. There must, moreover, be a way in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we must walk with God. God
   did at the beginning assign us a path to walk in with him, even the
   path of innocence and exact holiness, in a covenant of works. This
   path, by sin, is so filled with thorns and briers, so stopped up by
   curses and wrath, that no flesh living can take one step in that path;
   a new way for us to walk in must be found out, if ever we think to hold
   communion with God. And this also lies upon the former account. It is
   hid in Christ. All the world cannot, but by and in him, discover a path
   that a man may walk one step with God in. And therefore the Holy Ghost
   tells us that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> consecrated, dedicated, and set apart for
   that purpose, "a new and living way" into the holiest of all, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.20">Hebrews 10:20</reference>; a new one, for the first, old one was useless; a living one, for
   the other is dead: therefore, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, verse 22, "Let us draw near;"
   having a way to walk in, let us draw near. And this way that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   prepared is no other but himself, <reference osisRef="John.14.6">John 14:6</reference> In answer to them who
   would go to the Father, and hold communion with him, he tells them, "I
   am the way; and no man comes to the Father but by me." He is the medium
   of all communication between God and us. In him we meet, in him we
   walk. All influences of love, kindness, mercy, from God to us, are
   through him; all our returns of love, delight, faith, obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, are all through him; -- he being that "one way" God so often
   promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> his people: and it is a glorious way, <reference osisRef="Isa.35.8">Isaiah 35:8</reference>, -- a high
   way, a way of holiness, a way that none can err in that once enter it;
   which is farther set out, <reference osisRef="Isa.42.16">Isaiah 42:16</reference> All other ways, all paths but
   this, go down to the chambers of death; they all lead to walk contrary
   to God.
				</p><p>
   4. But suppose all this, -- that agreement be made, acquaintance given,
   and a way provided; yet if we have no strength to walk in that way,
   what will all this avail us? This also, then, must be added; of
   ourselves we are of no strength, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.6">Romans 5:6</reference>, -- poor weaklings, not able
   to go a step in the ways of God. When we are set in the way, either we
   throw ourselves down, or temptations cast us down, and we make no
   progress: and the Lord Jesus tells us plainly, that "without him we can
   do nothing," <reference osisRef="John.15.5">John 15:5</reference>; not any thing at all that shall have the least
   acceptation with God. Neither can all the creatures in heaven and earth
   yield us the least assistance. Men's contending to do it in their own
   power, comes to nothing. This part of this, wisdom also is hid in
   Christ. All strength to walk with God is from him. "I can do all things
   through Christ, which strengthens<note n="strengtheneth">Auto-modernized</note> me," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> St Paul, <reference osisRef="Phil.4.13">Philippians 4:13</reference>,
   who denies that of ourselves we have any sufficiency, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.5">2 Corinthians 3:5</reference> We
   that can do nothing in ourselves, we are such weaklings, can do all
   things in Jesus Christ, as giants; and therefore in him we are, against
   all oppositions in our way, "more than conquerors," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.37">Romans 8:37</reference>; and
   that because "from his fulness we receive grace for grace," <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference>
   From him have we the Spirit of life and power, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he bears, as on
   eagles' wings, swiftly, safely, in the paths of walking with God. Any
   step that is taken in any way, by strength that is not immediately from
   Christ, is one step towards hell. He first takes us by the arm and
   teaches us to go, until he leads us on to perfection. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> milk and
   strong meat to feed us; he strengthens us with all might, and is with
   us in our running the race that is set before us. But yet, --
				</p><p>
   5. From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> should we take this confidence as to walk with God; even our
   God, who is "a consuming fire?" <reference osisRef="Heb.12.29">Hebrews 12:29</reference> Was there not such a
   dread upon his people of old, that it was taken for granted among them
   that if they saw God at any time, it was not to be endured, -- they
   must die? Can any, but with extreme horror, think of that dreadful
   appearance that he made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them of old upon mount Sinai; until Moses
   himself, who was their mediator, said, "I exceedingly fear and quake?"
   <reference osisRef="Heb.12.21">Hebrews 12:21</reference>, and all the people said, "Let not God speak with us, lest
   we die?" <reference osisRef="Exod.20.19">Exodus 20:19</reference> Nay, though men have apprehensions of the
   goodness and kindness of God, yet upon any discovery, of his glory, how
   do they tremble, and are filled with dread and astonishment! Has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it
   not been so with the "choicest of his saints?" <reference osisRef="Hab.3.16">Habakkuk 3:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.6.5">Isaiah 6:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Job.42.5-Job.42.6">Job 42:5-6</reference> From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>, then, should we take to ourselves this
   boldness, to walk with God? This the apostle will inform us in <reference osisRef="Heb.10.19">Hebrews 10:19</reference>; it is "by the blood of Jesus:" so <reference osisRef="Eph.3.12">Ephesians 3:12</reference>, "In him we have
   boldness, and access with confidence;" -- not standing afar off, like
   the people at the giving of the law, but drawing nigh to God with
   boldness; and that upon this account:  The dread and terror of God
   entered by sin; Adam had not the least thought of hiding himself until
   he had sinned. The guilt of sin being on the conscience, and this being
   a common notion left in the hearts of all, that God is a most righteous
   revenger of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; this fills men with dread and horror at an
   apprehension of his presence, fearing that he is come to call their
   sins to remembrance. Now, the Lord Jesus, by the sacrifice and the
   atonement that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taken away this conscience of sin;
   that is, a dread of revenge from God upon the account of the guilt
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> removed the slaying sword of the law, and on that
   account gives us great boldness with God; discovering him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us now,
   no longer as a revenging Judge, but as a tender, merciful, and
   reconciled Father. Moreover, whereas there is on us by nature a spirit
   of bondage, filling us with innumerable tormenting fears, he takes it
   away, and gives us "the Spirit of adoption, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we cry Abba,
   Father," and behave ourselves with confidence and gracious boldness, as
   children: for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty," <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.17">2 Corinthians 3:17</reference>; that is, a freedom from all that dread and terror which
   the administration of the law brought with it. Now, as there is no sin
   that God will more severely revenge than any boldness that man takes
   with him out of Christ; so there is no grace more acceptable to him
   than that boldness which he is pleased to afford us in the blood of
   Jesus. There is, then, --
				</p><p>
   6. But one thing more to add; and that is, that two cannot walk
   together unless they have the same design in hand, and aim at the same
   end. This also, in a word, is given us in the Lord Jesus. The end of
   God is the advancement of his own glory; none can aim at this end, but
   only in the Lord Jesus. The sum of all is, that the whole wisdom of our
   walking with God is hid in Christ, and from him only to be obtained; as
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been manifest by an enumeration of particulars.
				</p><p>
   And so have I brought my first demonstration of what I intended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a
   close, and manifested that all true wisdom and knowledge is laid up in,
   and laid out by, the Lord Jesus; and this by an induction of the chief
   particular heads of those things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> confessedly our wisdom does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   consist. I have but one more to add, and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> I shall be brief.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, [210] then, I say this truth will be farther manifested by
   the consideration of the insufficiency and vanity of any thing else
   that may lay claim or pretend to a title to wisdom.
				</p><p>
   There be two things in the world that do pass under this account:  1.
   The one is learning or literature; skill and knowledge of arts,
   sciences, tongues, with the knowledge of the things that are past. 2.
   Prudence and skill for the management of ourselves in reference to
   others, in civil affairs, for public good; which is much the fairest
   flower within the border of nature's garden. Now, concerning both
   these, I shall briefly evince, -- (1.) That they are utterly
   insufficient for the compassing and obtaining of those particular ends
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they are designed. (2.) That both of them in union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>,
   with their utmost improvement, cannot reach the true general end of
   wisdom. Both which considerations will set the crown, in the issue,
   upon the head of Jesus Christ: 
				</p><p>
   1. Begin we with the first of these, and that as to the first
   particular. Learning itself, if it were all in one man, is not able to
   compass the particular end whereto it is designed; which writes "vanity
   and vexation" upon the forehead of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   The particular end of literature (though not observed by many, men's
   eyes being fixed on false ends, which compels them in their progress
   "aberrare a scopo") is none other but to remove some part of that curse
   which is come upon us by sin. Learning is the product of the soul's
   struggling with the curse for sin. Adam, at his first creation, was
   completely furnished with all that knowledge (excepting only things not
   then in being, neither in themselves nor in any natural causes, as that
   which we now call tongues, and those things that are the subject of
   story), as far as it lies in a needful tendency to the utmost end of
   man, which we now press after. There was no straitness, much less
   darkness, upon his understanding, that should make him sweat for a way
   to improve, and make out those general conceptions of things which he
   had. For his knowledge of nature, it is manifest, from his imposition
   of suitable names on all the creatures (the particular reasons of the
   most of which to us are lost); in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, from the approbation given of
   his nomination of things in the Scripture, and the significance of what
   yet remains evident, it is most apparent it was done upon a clear
   acquaintance with their natures. Hence Plato could observe, [211] that
   he was most wise that first imposed names on things; yea, had more than
   human wisdom. Were the wisest man living, yea, a general collection of
   all the wise men in the world, to make an experiment of their skill and
   learning, in giving names to all living creatures, suitable to their
   natures and expressive of their qualities, they would quickly perceive
   the loss they have incurred. Adam was made perfect, for the whole end
   of ruling the creatures and living to God, for which he was made;
   which, without the knowledge of the nature of the one and the will of
   the other, he could not be. All this being lost by sin, a
   multiplication of tongues also being brought in, as a curse for an
   after rebellion, [212] the whole design of learning is but to
   disentangle the soul from this issue of sin. Ignorance, darkness, and
   blindness, is come upon the understanding; acquaintance with the works
   of God, spiritual and natural, is lost; strangeness of communication is
   given, by multiplication of tongues; tumultuating of passions and
   affections, with innumerable darkening prejudices, are also come upon
   us. To remove and take this away -- to disentangle the mind in its
   reasonings, to recover an acquaintance with the works of God, to
   subduct the soul from under the effects of the curse of division of
   tongues -- is the aim and tendency of literature. This is the "aliquid
   quo tendit;" and he that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any other aim in it, "Passim sequitur
   corvum testaque lutoque." [213] Now, not to insist upon that vanity and
   vexation of spirit, with the innumerable evils with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> this
   enterprise is attended, this is that I only say, it is in itself no way
   sufficient for the attainment of its end, which writes vanity upon its
   forehead with characters not to be obliterated. To this purpose I
   desire to observe these two things: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) That the knowledge aimed at to be recovered was given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> man in
   order to his walking with God, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that supernatural end to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he
   was appointed. For after he was furnished with all his endowments, the
   law of life and death was given to him, that he might know therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he
   received them. Therefore, knowledge in him was spiritualized and
   sanctified: even that knowledge which he had by nature, in respect of
   its principle and end, was spiritual.
				</p><p>
   (2.) That the loss of it is part of that curse which was inflicted on
   us for sin. Whatever we come short in of the state of the first man in
   innocence, whether in loss of good or addition of evil, it is all of
   the curse for sin. Besides, that blindness, ignorance, darkness,
   deadness, which is everywhere ascribed to us in the state of nature,
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> fully comprise that also of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak.
				</p><p>
   On these two considerations it is most apparent that learning can no
   way of itself attain the end it aims<note n="aimeth">Auto-modernized</note> at. For, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] That light which by it is discovered (which, the Lord knows, is
   very little, weak, obscure, imperfect, uncertain, conjectural, for a
   great part only enabling men to quarrel with and oppose one another, to
   the reproach of reason, yet I say, that which is attained by it) is not
   in the least measure by it spiritualized, or brought into that order of
   living to God, and with God, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> at first it lay. This is wholly
   beyond its reach. As to this end, the apostle assures us that the
   utmost issue that men come to, is darkness and folly, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.21-Rom.1.22">Romans 1:21-22</reference>
   Who knows not the profound inquiries, the subtile disputations, the
   acute reasonings, the admirable discoveries of Socrates, Plato, and
   Aristotle, and others? What, as to the purpose in hand, did they attain
   by all their studies and endeavours? Emoranthesan, says the apostle, --
   "They became fools." He that, by general consent, bears the crown of
   reputation for wisdom from them all, with whom to have lived was
   counted an inestimable happiness, [214] died like a fool, sacrificing a
   cock to AEsculapius. And another [apostle assures us], that Jesus
   Christ alone is "the true Light," that lights<note n="lighteth">Auto-modernized</note> us, <reference osisRef="John.1.9">John 1:9</reference> And
   there is not any that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any true light, but what is immediately from
   him. After all the learning of men, if they have nothing else, they are
   still natural men, and perceive not the things of God. Their light is
   still but darkness; and how great is that darkness! It is the Lord
   Jesus alone who is anointed to open the eyes of the blind. Men cannot
   spiritualize a notion, nor lay it in any order to the glorifying of
   God. After all their endeavours, they are still blind and dark, yea,
   darkness itself, knowing nothing as they should. I know how the men of
   these attainments are apt to say, "Are we blind also?" with great
   contempt of others; but God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> blasted all their pride: [215]
   "Where," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "is the wise? where is the scribe," etc., <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.20">1 Corinthians 1:20</reference> I shall not add what Paul has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> farther cautioned us, to the seeming
   condemning of philosophy as being fitted to make spoil of souls; nor
   what [216] Tertullian with some other of the ancients have spoken of
   it; being very confident that it was the abuse, and not the true use
   and advantage of it, that they opposed. But, --
				</p><p>
   [2.] The darkness and ignorance that it strives to remove, being come
   upon us as a curse, it is not in the least measure, as it is a curse,
   able to remove it or take it away. He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> attained to the
   greatest height of literature, yet if he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> nothing else, -- if he
   have not Christ, -- is as much under the curse of blindness, ignorance,
   stupidity, dullness, as the poorest, silliest soul in the world. The
   curse is only removed in him who was made a curse for us. Every thing
   that is penal is taken away only by him on whom all our sins did meet
   in a way of punishment; yea, upon this account. The more abilities the
   mind is furnished withal, the more it closes with the curse, and
   strengthens itself to act its enmity against God. All that it receives
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> but help it to set up high thoughts and imaginations against the
   Lord Christ. So that this knowledge comes short of what in particular
   it is designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; and therefore cannot be that solid wisdom we are
   inquiring after.
				</p><p>
   There be sundry other things through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it were easy to blur the
   countenance of this wisdom; and, from its intricacy, difficulty,
   uncertainty, unsatisfactoriness, -- betraying its followers into that
   which they most profess to avoid, blindness and folly, -- to write upon
   it "vanity and vexation of spirit." I hope I shall not need to add any
   thing to clear myself for not giving a due esteem and respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   literature, my intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> being only to cast it down at the feet of
   Jesus Christ, and to set the crown upon his head.
				</p><p>
   2. Neither can the second part of the choicest wisdom out of Christ
   attain the peculiar end to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> it is appointed; and that is prudence
   in the management of civil affairs, -- than which no perishing thing is
   more glorious, -- nothing more useful for the common good of human
   kind. Now, the immediate end of this prudence is to keep the rational
   world in bounds and order, to draw circles about the sons of men, and
   to keep them from passing their allotted bounds and limits, to the
   mutual disturbance and destruction of each other. All manner of trouble
   and disturbance arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from irregularity: one man breaking in upon the
   rights, usages, interests, relations of another, sets this world at
   variance. The sum and aim of all wisdom below is, to cause all things
   to move in their proper sphere, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it would be impossible there
   should be any more interfering than is in the celestial orbs,
   notwithstanding all their divers and various motions: to keep all to
   their own allotments, within the compass of the lines that are fallen
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, is the special end of this wisdom.
				</p><p>
   Now, it will be a very easy task, to demonstrate that all civil
   prudence whatever [217] (besides the vexation of its attainment, and
   loss being attained) is no way able to compass this end. The present
   condition of affairs throughout the world, as also that of former ages,
   will abundantly testify it; but I shall farther discover the vanity of
   it for this end in some few observations. And the
				</p><p>
   (1.) First is, That, through the righteous judgment of God lopping off
   the top flowers of the pride of men, it frequently comes to pass that
   those who are furnished with the greatest abilities of this kind do lay
   them out to a direct contrary end to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that which is their natural
   tendency and aim. From whom, for the most part, are all the commotions
   in the world, -- the breaking up of bounds, setting the whole frame of
   nature on fire? is it not from such men as these. Were not men so wise,
   the world, perhaps, would be more quiet, when the end of wisdom is to
   keep it in quietness. This seems to be a curse that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> spread
   upon the wisdom of the world, in the most in whom it is, that it shall
   be employed in direct opposition to its proper end.
				</p><p>
   (2.) That God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made this a constant path towards the advancement of
   his own glory, even to leaven the wisdom and the counsels of the wisest
   of the sons of men with folly and madness, that they shall, in the
   depth of their policy, [218] advise things for the compassing of the
   ends they do propose as unsuitable as any thing that could proceed out
   of the mouth of a child or a fool, and as directly tending to their own
   disappointment and ruin as any thing that could be invented against
   them. "He destroys the wisdom of the wise, and brings to nothing the
   understanding of the prudent," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.19">1 Corinthians 1:19</reference> This he largely describes,
   <reference osisRef="Isa.19.11-Isa.19.14">Isaiah 19:11-14</reference> Drunkenness and staggering is the issue of all their
   wisdom; and that upon this account, -- the Lord gives them the spirit
   of giddiness. So also <reference osisRef="Job.5.12-Job.5.14">Job 5:12-14</reference> They meet with darkness in the
   day-time: [219] when all things seem clear about them, and a man would
   wonder how men should miss their way, then will God make it darkness to
   such as these. So <reference osisRef="Ps.33.10">Psalms 33:10</reference> Hence God, as it were, sets them at
   work, and undertakes their disappointment, <reference osisRef="Isa.8.9-Isa.8.10">Isaiah 8:9-10</reference>, "Go about
   your counsels," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord, "and I will take order that it shall
   come to nought." And, <reference osisRef="Ps.2.3-Ps.2.4">Psalms 2:3-4</reference>, when men are deep at their plots
   and contrivances, God is said to have them in derision, to laugh them
   to scorn, seeing the poor worms industriously working out their own
   ruin. Never was this made more clear than in the days in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we live.
   Scarcely have any wise men been brought to destruction, but it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   evidently been through their own folly; neither has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the wisest counsel
   of most been one jot better than madness.
				</p><p>
   (3.) That this wisdom, which should tend to universal quietness, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   almost constantly given universal disquietness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves in whom
   it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been most eminent. "In much wisdom is much grief," <reference osisRef="Eccl.1.18">Ecclesiastes 1:18</reference> And in the issue, some of them have made away with themselves, as
   Ahithophel; and the most of them have been violently dispatched by
   others. There is, indeed, no end of the folly of this wisdom. [220] The
   great men of the world carry away the reputation of it; -- really it is
   found in few of them. They are, for the most part, common events,
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they contribute not the least mite, which are ascribed to
   their care, vigilance, and foresight. Mean men, that have learned to
   adore what is above them, reverence the meetings and conferences of
   those who are in greatness and esteem. Their weakness and folly is
   little known. Where this wisdom has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been most eminent, it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> dwelt
   so close upon the borders of atheism, been attended with such falseness
   and injustice, that it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made its possessors wicked and infamous.
				</p><p>
   I shall not need to give any more instances to manifest the
   insufficiency of this wisdom for the attaining of its own peculiar and
   immediate end. This is the vanity of any thing whatever, -- that it
   comes short of the mark it is directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. It is far, then, from
   being true and solid wisdom, seeing on the forehead of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> you may
   read "Disappointment."
				</p><p>
   And this is the first reason why true wisdom cannot consist in either
   of these, -- because they come short even of the particular and
   immediate ends they aim at. But, --
				</p><p>
   Secondly, Both these in union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>, with their utmost improvement, are
   not able to reach the true general end of wisdom. This assertion also
   falls<note n="falleth">Auto-modernized</note> under an easy demonstration, and it were a facile thing to
   discover their disability and unsuitableness for the true end of
   wisdom; but it is so professedly done by him who had the largest
   portion of both of any of the sons of men (Solomon in his Preacher),
   that I shall not any farther insist upon it.
				</p><p>
   To draw, then, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a close:  if true and solid wisdom is not in the
   least to be found amongst these, if the pearl be not hid in this field,
   if these two are but vanity and disappointment, it cannot but be to no
   purpose to seek for it in any thing else below, these being amongst
   them incomparably the most excellent; and therefore, with one accord,
   let us set the crown of this wisdom on the head of the Lord Jesus.
				</p><p>
   Let the reader, then, in a few words, take a view of the tendency of
   this whole digression. To draw our hearts to the more cheerful
   entertainment of and delight in the Lord Jesus, is the aim of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. If
   all wisdom be laid up in him, and by an interest in him only to be
   attained, -- if all things beside him and without him that lay claim
   thereto are folly and vanity, -- let them that would be wise learn
   where to repose their souls.

<p>
   Of communion with Christ in a conjugal relation in respect of
   consequential affections -- His delight in his saints first insisted
   on, <reference osisRef="Isa.62.5">Isaiah 62:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Song.3.11">Song of Solomon 3:11</reference>; <reference osisRef="Prov.8.21">Proverbs 8:21</reference> -- Instance of Christ's
   delight in believers -- He reveals his whole heart to them, <reference osisRef="John.15.14-John.15.15">John 15:14-15</reference>; himself, <reference osisRef="John.14.21">John 14:21</reference>; his kingdom; enables them to communicate
   their mind to him, giving them assistance, a way, boldness, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.26-Rom.8.27">Romans 8:26-27</reference> -- The saints delight in Christ; this manifested <reference osisRef="Song.2.7">Song of Solomon 2:7</reference>,
   viii. 6 -- <reference osisRef="Song.3.1-Song.3.5">Song of Solomon 3:1-5</reference>, opened -- Their delight in his servants and
   ordinances of worship for his sake.
				</p><p>
   [221] The communion begun, as before declared, between Christ and the
   soul, is in the next place carried on by suitable consequential
   affections, -- affections suiting such a relation. Christ having given
   himself to the soul, loves the soul; and the soul having given itself
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> him also. Christ loves his own, yea, "loves them to
   the end," <reference osisRef="John.13.1">John 13:1</reference>; and the saints they love Christ, they "love the
   Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity," <reference osisRef="Eph.6.24">Ephesians 6:24</reference>
				</p><p>
   Now the love of Christ, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he follows his saints, consists in
   these four things:  I. Delight. II. Valuation. III. Pity, or
   compassion. IV. Bounty. The love, also, of the saints to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ may
   be referred to these four heads:  Delight; Valuation; Chastity; Duty.
				</p><p>
   Two of these are of the same kind, and two distinct; as is required in
   this relation, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> all things stand not on equal terms.
				</p><p>
   I. The first thing on the part of Christ is delight. Delight is the
   flowing of love and joy, -- the [222] rest and complacence of the mind
   in a suitable, desirable good enjoyed. Now, Christ delights exceedingly
   in his saints: "As the bridegroom rejoices<note n="rejoiceth">Auto-modernized</note> over the bride, so shall
   your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> God rejoice over you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Isa.62.5">Isaiah 62:5</reference> Hence he calls<note n="calleth">Auto-modernized</note> the day of
   his espousals, the day of the "gladness of his heart," <reference osisRef="Song.3.11">Song of Solomon 3:11</reference>
   It is known that usually this is the most unmixed delight that the sons
   of men are in their pilgrimage made partakers of. The delight of the
   bridegroom in the day of his espousals is the height of what an
   expression of delight can be carried to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. This is in Christ answerable
   to the relation he takes us into. His heart is glad in us, without
   sorrow. And every day while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> we live is his wedding-day. It is said of
   him, <reference osisRef="Zeph.3.17">Zephaniah 3:17</reference>, "The Lord your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> God in the midst of you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>" (that is,
   dwelling amongst us, taking our nature, <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>) "is mighty; he will
   save, he will rejoice over you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> with joy; he will rest in his love, he
   will joy over you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> with singing;" which is a full description of
   delight, in all the parts of it, -- joy and exultation, rest and
   complacence. "I rejoiced," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "in the habitable parts of the
   earth, and my delights were with the sons of men," <reference osisRef="Prov.8.31">Proverbs 8:31</reference> The
   thoughts of communion with the saints were the joy of his heart from
   eternity. On the compact and agreement that was between his Father and
   him, that he should divide a portion with the strong, and save a
   remnant for his inheritance, his soul rejoiced in the thoughts of that
   pleasure and delight which he would take in them, when he should
   actually take them into communion with himself. Therefore in the
   preceding verse it is said he was by him as 'mvn, say we, "As one
   brought up with him," "alumnus;" the LXX. render it harmozousa; and the
   Latin, with most other translations, "cuncta componens," or
   "disponens." The word taken actively, signifies him whom another takes
   into his care to breed up, and disposes<note n="disposeth">Auto-modernized</note> of things for his advantage.
   So did Christ take us then into his care, and rejoiced in the thoughts
   of the execution of his trust. Concerning them he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "Here will I
   dwell, and here will I make my habitation for ever." For them has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he
   chosen for his temple and his dwelling-place, because he delights<note n="delighteth">Auto-modernized</note> in
   them. This makes him take them so nigh himself in every relation. As he
   is God, they are his temple; as he is a king, they are his subjects, --
   he is the king of saints; as he is a head, they are his body, -- he is
   the head of the church; as he is a first-born, he makes them his
   brethren, -- "he is not ashamed to call them brethren."
				</p><p>
   I shall choose out one particular from among many as an instance for
   the proof of this thing; and that is this:  Christ reveals his
   secrets, his mind, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his saints, and enables them to reveal the
   secrets of their hearts to him, -- an evident demonstration of great
   delight. It was Samson's carnal delight in Delilah that prevailed with
   him to reveal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> her those things which were of greatest concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; he will not hide his mind from her, though it cost him his
   life. It is only a bosom friend into whom we will unbosom ourselves.
   Neither is there, possibly, a greater evidence of delight in close
   communion than this, that one will reveal his heart to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him whom he
   takes into society, and not entertain him with things common and
   vulgarly known. And therefore have I chose this instance, from amongst
   a thousand that might be given, of this delight of Christ in his
   saints.
				</p><p>
   He, then, communicates his mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his saints, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them only; --
   his mind, the counsel of his love, the thoughts of his heart, the
   purposes of his bosom, for our eternal good, -- his mind, the ways of
   his grace, the workings of his Spirit, the rule of his sceptre, And the
   obedience of his gospel. [223] All spiritual revelation is by Christ.
   He is "the true Light, that lights<note n="lighteth">Auto-modernized</note> every man that comes into the
   world," <reference osisRef="John.1.9">John 1:9</reference> He is the "Day-spring," the "Day-star," and the
   "Sun;" so that it is impossible any light should be but by him. From
   him it is that "the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and
   he shows them his covenant," <reference osisRef="Ps.25.14">Psalms 25:14</reference>; as he expresses it at large,
   <reference osisRef="John.15.14-John.15.15">John 15:14-15</reference>, [224] "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I
   command you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant
   knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> not what his lord does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>: but I have called you friends; for
   [225] all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   you." He makes them as his friends, and uses<note n="useth">Auto-modernized</note> them as friends, -- as
   bosom friends, in whom he is delighted. He makes known all his mind
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them; every thing that his Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> committed to him as
   Mediator to be revealed, <reference osisRef="Acts.20.24">Acts 20:24</reference> And the apostle declares how this
   is done, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.10-1Cor.2.11">1 Corinthians 2:10-11</reference>, "?God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> revealed these things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by
   his Spirit;' for we have received him, that we might know the things
   that are freely given us of God.'?" He sends us his Spirits as he
   promised, to make known his mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his saints, and to lead them into
   all truth. And thence the apostle concludes, "We have known the mind of
   Christ," verse 16; "for he uses<note n="useth">Auto-modernized</note> us as friends, and declares<note n="declareth">Auto-modernized</note> it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us," <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference> There is not any thing in the heart of Christ, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   these his friends are concerned, that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not reveal to them. All
   his love, his good-will, the secrets of his covenant, the paths of
   obedience, the mystery of faith, is told them.
				</p><p>
   And all this is spoken in opposition to unbelievers, with whom he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   no communion. These know nothing of the mind of Christ as they ought:
   "The natural man receives<note n="receiveth">Auto-modernized</note> not the things that are of God," <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.14">1 Corinthians 2:14</reference> There is a wide difference between understanding the doctrine of
   the Scripture as in the letter, and a true knowing the mind of Christ.
   This we have by special unction from Christ, <reference osisRef="1John.2.27">1 John 2:27</reference>, "We have an
   unction from the Holy One, and we know all things," <reference osisRef="1John.2.20">1 John 2:20</reference>
				</p><p>
   Now, the things which in this communion Christ reveals to them that he
   delights in, may be referred to these two heads:  1. Himself. 2. His
   kingdom.
				</p><p>
   1. Himself. <reference osisRef="John.14.21">John 14:21</reference>, "He that loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> me shall be loved of my
   Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him;" --
   "manifest myself in all my graces, desirableness, and loveliness; he
   shall know me as I am, and such I will be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, -- a Saviour, a
   Redeemer, the chiefest of ten thousand." He shall be acquainted with
   the true worth and value of the pearl of price; let others look upon
   him as having neither form nor comeliness, as no way desirable, he will
   manifest himself and his excellencies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them in whom he is
   delighted, that they shall see him altogether lovely. He will vail
   himself to all the world; but the saints with open face shall behold
   his beauty and his glory, and so be translated into the image of the
   same glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. His kingdom. They shall be acquainted with the government of his
   Spirit in their hearts; as also with his rule and the administration of
   authority in his word, and among his churches.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Thus, in the first place, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he manifest his delight in his
   saints, -- he communicates his secrets to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. He gives them to know
   his person, his excellencies, his grace, his love, his kingdom, his
   will, the riches of his goodness, and the bowels of his mercy, more and
   more, when the world shall neither see nor know any such thing.
				</p><p>
   (2.) He enables his saints to communicate their mind, to reveal their
   souls, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, that so they may walk together as intimate friends.
   Christ knows the minds of all. He knows what is in man, and needs not
   that any man testify of him, <reference osisRef="John.2.25">John 2:25</reference> He searches<note n="searcheth">Auto-modernized</note> the hearts and
   tries<note n="trieth">Auto-modernized</note> the reins of all, <reference osisRef="Rev.2.23">Revelation of John 2:23</reference> But all know not how to
   communicate their mind to Christ. It will not avail a man at all that
   Christ knows his mind; for so he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> of every one, whether he will or
   no; -- but that a man can make his heart known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, this is
   consolation. Hence the prayers of the saints are [226] incense, odours;
   and those of others are [227] howling, cutting off a dog's neck,
   offering of swine's blood, -- an abomination to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord. Now, three
   things are required to enable a man to communicate his heart to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Lord Jesus: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] Assistance for the work; for of ourselves we cannot do it. And
   this the saints have by the Spirit of Jesus, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.26-Rom.8.27">Romans 8:26-27</reference>,
   "Likewise the Spirit also helps<note n="helpeth">Auto-modernized</note> our infirmities: for we know not what
   we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself makes<note n="maketh">Auto-modernized</note>
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that
   searches<note n="searcheth">Auto-modernized</note> the hearts knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> what is the mind of the Spirit, because he
   makes<note n="maketh">Auto-modernized</note> intercession for the saints according to the will of God." All
   endeavours, all attempts for communion with God, without the supplies
   of the Spirit of supplications, without his effectual working in the
   heart, is of no value, nor to any purpose. And this opening of our
   hearts and bosoms to the Lord Jesus is that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is exceedingly
   delighted. Hence is that affectionate call of his to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, to be
   treating with him on this account, <reference osisRef="Song.2.14">Song of Solomon 2:14</reference>, "O my dove, that are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note>
   in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> countenance, let me
   hear your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> voice; for sweet is your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> voice, and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> countenance is comely."
   When the soul on any account is driven to hide itself, -- in any
   neglected condition, in the most unlikely place of abode, -- then does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   he call for this communication of itself by prayer to him; for which he
   gives the assistance of the Spirit mentioned.
				</p><p>
   [2.] A way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> to approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God with our desires. This, also,
   we have by him provided for us, <reference osisRef="John.14.5-John.14.6">John 14:5-6</reference>, "Thomas says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Jesus, Lord, we know not whither you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> goest; and how can we know the
   way? Jesus says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, I am the [228] way; no man comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Father, but by me." That way which we had of going to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God at our
   creation is quite shut up by sin. The sword of the law, which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> fire
   put into it by sin, turns every way, to stop all passages to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   communion with God. Jesus Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> "consecrated a [229] new and
   living way" (for the saints) "through the vail, that is to say, his
   flesh," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.20">Hebrews 10:20</reference> He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> consecrated and set it apart for believers,
   and for them alone. Others pretend to go to God with their prayers, but
   they come not nigh him. How can they possibly come to the end who go
   not in the way? Christ only is the way to the throne of grace; none
   comes to God but by him. "By him we have an access in one Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the Father," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference> These two things, then, the saints have for
   the opening of their hearts at the throne of grace, -- assistance and a
   way. The assistance of the Spirit, without which they are nothing; and
   the way of Christ's mediation, without which God is not to be
   approached to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   [3.] Boldness to go to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. The voice of sinners in themselves, if
   once acquainted with the terror of the Lord, is, -- "Who among us shall
   dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with
   everlasting burnings?" <reference osisRef="Isa.33.14">Isaiah 33:14</reference> And no marvel; [230] shame and
   trembling before God are the proper issues of sin. God will revenge
   that carnal, atheistical boldness which sinners out of Christ do use
   towards him. But we have now "boldness to enter into the holiest by the
   blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> consecrated for
   us, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh: and having an high
   priest over the house of God, we may draw near with a true heart, in
   full assurance of faith," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.19-Heb.10.20">Hebrews 10:19-20</reference> The truth is, such is the
   glory and terror of the Lord, such the infinite perfection of his
   holiness, that, on clear sight of it, it will make the soul conclude
   that of itself it [231] cannot serve him; nor will it be to any
   advantage, but add to the fierceness of his destruction, once to draw
   nigh to him. It is in Christ alone, and on the account alone of his
   oblation and intercession, that we have any boldness to approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him. And these three advantages have the saints of communicating their
   minds to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided for them, because he
   delights in them.
				</p><p>
   To touch a little by the way, because this is of great importance, I
   will instance in one of these, as I might in every one, that you may
   see the difference between a spiritual revealing of our minds to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ in this acceptable manner, and that praying upon conviction
   which others practise; and this shall be from the first, -- namely, the
   assistance we have by the Spirit.
				</p><p>
   1st. The Spirit of Christ reveals to us our own wants, that we may
   reveal them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him: "We know not what we should pray for as we
   ought," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.26">Romans 8:26</reference>; no [232] teachings under those of the Spirit of
   God are able to make our souls acquainted with their own wants, -- its
   burdens, its temptations. For a soul to know its wants, its
   infirmities, is a heavenly discovery. He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> this [233]
   assistance, his prayer is more than half made before he begins to pray.
   His conscience is affected with what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to do; his mind and spirit
   contend within him, there especially where he finds himself most
   straitened. He brings his burden on his shoulders, and unloads himself
   on the Lord Christ. He finds (not by a perplexing conviction, but a
   holy sense and weariness of sin) where he is dead, where dull and cold,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> unbelieving, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> tempted above all his strength, where the
   light of God's countenance is wanting. And all these the soul has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a
   sense of by the Spirit, -- an inexpressible sense and experience.
   Without this, prayer is not prayer; [234] men's voices may be heard,
   but they speak not in their hearts. Sense of want is the spring of
   desire; -- natural, of natural; spiritual, of spiritual. Without this
   sense given by the Holy Ghost, there is neither desire nor prayer.
				</p><p>
   2dly. The expressions, or the words of such persons, come exceeding
   short of the labouring of their hearts; and therefore, in and after
   their supplications, "the Spirit makes intercession with sighs and
   groans that cannot be [235] uttered." Some men's words go exceedingly
   beyond their hearts. Did their spirits come up to their expressions, it
   were well. He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> this assistance can provide no clothing that is
   large and broad enough to set forth the desires of his heart; and
   therefore, in the close of his best and most fervent supplications,
   such a person finds a double dissatisfaction in them:  1. That they
   are not a righteousness to be rested on; that if God should [236] mark
   what is in them amiss, they could not abide the trial. 2. That his
   heart in them is not poured out, nor delivered in any proportion to the
   holy desires and labourings that were conceived in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; though he may
   in Christ have great refreshment by them. The more they [saints] speak,
   the more they find they have left unspoken.
				</p><p>
   3dly. The intercession of the saints thus assisted is according to the
   mind of God; that is, they are guided by the Spirit to make requests
   for those things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God which it is his will they should desire, --
   which he knows to be good for them, useful and suitable to them, in the
   condition in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are. There are many ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we may know
   when we make our supplications according to the will of God. I shall
   instance only in one; that is, when we do it according to the promise:
   when our prayers are regulated by the promise, we make them according
   to the will of God. So David, <reference osisRef="Ps.119.49">Psalms 119:49</reference>, "Remember the word upon
   which you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> caused me to hope." He prays, and regulates his desire
   by the word of promise in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he had trusted. But yet, men may ask
   that which is in the promise, and yet not have their prayers regulated
   by the promise. They may pray for what is in the promise, but not as it
   is in the promise. So James says some "ask and receive not, because
   they ask amiss, that they may spend it on their lusts," chap. iv. 3.
   Though the things which God would have us ask be requested, yet if not
   according as he would have us do it, we ask amiss.
				</p><p>
   Two things are required, that we may pray for the things in the
   promise, as they are in the promise: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) That we look upon them as promised, and promised in Christ; that
   is, that all the reason we have from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> we hope for attaining the things
   we ask for, is from the mediation and purchase of Christ, in whom all
   the promises are yea and amen. This it is to ask the Father in Christ's
   name, -- God as a father, the fountain; and Christ as the procurer of
   them.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) That we ask for them for the end of the promise, not to spend
   on our lusts. When we ask pardon for sin, with secret [237] reserves in
   our hearts to continue in sin, we ask the choicest mercy of the
   covenant, to spend it on our lusts. The end of the promise the apostle
   tells us, <reference osisRef="2Cor.7.1">2 Corinthians 7:1</reference>, "Having these promises, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God." When we ask what is in the promise, as it
   is in the promise, to this end of the promise, our supplications are
   according to the will of God. And this is the first conjugal affection
   that Christ exercises<note n="exerciseth">Auto-modernized</note> towards believers, -- he delights in them; which
   that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> is evident, as upon other considerations innumerable, so
   from the instance given.
				</p><p>
   In return to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, for the carrying on of the communion between them,
   the saints delight in Christ; he is their joy, their crown, their
   rejoicing, their life, food, health, strength, desire, righteousness,
   salvation, blessedness: without him they have nothing; in him they
   shall find all things. <reference osisRef="Gal.6.14">Galatians 6:14</reference>, "God forbid that I should glory,
   save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, from the
   foundation of the world, been the hope, expectation, desire, and
   delight of all believers. The promise of him was all (and it was
   enough) that God gave Adam in his inexpressible distress, to relieve
   and comfort him, <reference osisRef="Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</reference> Eve perhaps supposed that the promised
   seed had been born in her first-born, when she said, "I have gotten a
   man from [238] the Lord" (so most properly, 't denoting the fourth
   case); and this was the matter of her joy, <reference osisRef="Gen.4.1">Genesis 4:1</reference> Lamech having
   Noah given to him as a type of Christ and salvation by him, cries out,
   "This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands,
   because of the ground which the Lord has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> cursed," <reference osisRef="Gen.5.29">Genesis 5:29</reference>; he
   rejoices in him who was to take away the curse, by being made a curse
   for us. When Abraham was in the height of his glory, returning from the
   conquest of the kings of the east, that came against the confederate
   kings of the vale of Sodom, God appears to him with a glorious promise,
   <reference osisRef="Gen.15.1">Genesis 15:1</reference>, "Fear not, Abram: I am your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> shield, and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> exceeding great
   reward." What now could his soul more desire? Alas! he cries (as Reuben
   afterward, upon the loss of Joseph), "The child is not, and whither
   shall I go?" Verse 2, "Lord God, what will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> give me, seeing I go
   childless?" "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> promised that in my seed shall all the earth be
   blessed; if I have not that seed, ah! what good will all other things
   do me?" Thence it is said that he "rejoiced to see the day of Christ;
   he saw it, and was glad," <reference osisRef="John.8.56">John 8:56</reference>; the thoughts of the coming of
   Christ, which he looked on at the distance of two thousand years, was
   the joy and delight of his heart. Jacob, blessing his sons, lifted up
   his spirit when he comes to Judah, in whom he considered the Shiloh to
   come, <reference osisRef="Gen.49.8-Gen.49.9">Genesis 49:8-9</reference>; and a little after, wearied with the foresight
   and consideration of the distresses of his posterity, this he diverts
   to for his relief, as that great delight of his soul: "I have waited
   for your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Salvation, O God;" -- for him who was to be the salvation of
   his people. But it would be endless to instance in particulars. Old
   Simon sums up the whole: Christ is God's salvation, and Israel's glory,
   <reference osisRef="Luke.2.30-Luke.2.31">Luke 2:30-31</reference>; and whatever was called the glory of old, it was
   either himself or a type of him. The glory of man is their delight.
   Hence, <reference osisRef="Hag.2.7">Haggai 2:7</reference>, he is called "The Desire of all nations." Him whom
   their soul loves and delights in, [they] desire and long after. So is
   the saints' delight in him made a description of him, by way of
   eminence, <reference osisRef="Mal.3.1">Malachi 3:1</reference>: "The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
   his temple, even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in." "He
   whom ye seek, whom ye delight in," is the description of Christ. He is
   their delight and desirable one, the person of their desire. To fix on
   something in particular: 
				</p><p>
   In that pattern of communion with Jesus Christ which we have in the
   Canticles, this is abundantly insisted on. The spouse tells us that she
   sits down under his shadow with great delight, <reference osisRef="Song.2.3">Song of Solomon 2:3</reference> And this
   delight to be vigorous and active, she manifests several ways; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   we should labour to find our hearts in like manner towards him: 
				</p><p>
   1. By her exceeding great care to keep his company and society, when
   once she had obtained it, chap. ii. 7, "I charge you, O ye daughters of
   Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not
   up, nor awake my love till he please." Having obtained sweet communion
   with Christ, described in the verses foregoing (of which before), here
   she expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> her delight in it and desire of the continuance of it;
   and therefore, following on the allusion formerly insisted on, she
   speaks as one would do to her companion, [as one] that had rest with
   one she loved: "I charge you, by all that is dear to you, -- by the
   things you most delight in, which among the creatures are most lovely,
   all the pleasant and desirable things that you can think of, -- that
   you disturb him not." The sum of her aim and desire is, that nothing
   may fall out, nothing of sin or provocation happen, that may occasion
   Christ to depart from her, or to remove from that dispensation in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   he seemed to take that rest in her: "O stir him not up until he
   please!" that [239] is, never. h'hvh, -- love itself in the abstract,
   to express a pathos, or earnest affection; for so that word is often
   used. When once the soul of a believer has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> obtained sweet and real
   communion with Christ, it looks about him, watches<note n="watcheth">Auto-modernized</note> all temptations,
   all ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> sin might approach, to disturb him in his enjoyment of
   his dear Lord and Saviour, his rest and desire. How does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it charge
   itself not to omit any thing, nor to do any thing that may interrupt
   the communion obtained! And because the common entrance of temptations,
   which tend to the disturbance of that rest and complacency which Christ
   takes in the soul, is from delightful diversions from actual communion
   with him; therefore is desire strong and active that the companions of
   such a soul, those with whom it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> converse, would not, by their
   proposals or allurements, divert it into any such frame as Christ
   cannot delight nor rest in. A believer that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> gotten Christ in his
   arms, is like one that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> found great spoils, or a pearl of price. He
   looks about him every way, and fears every thing that may deprive him
   of it. Riches make men watchful; and the actual sensible possession of
   him, in whom are all the riches and treasure of God, will make men look
   about them for the keeping of him. The line of choicest communion, is a
   line of the greatest spiritual solicitousness: carelessness in the
   enjoyment of Christ pretended, is a manifest evidence of a false heart.
				</p><p>
   2. The spouse manifests her delight in him, by the utmost impatience of
   his absence, with desires still of nearer communion with him. [240]
   Chap. viii. 6, "Set me as a seal upon your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> heart, as a seal upon your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note>
   arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the
   coals of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> are coals of fire, which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a most vehement flame." The
   allusion is doubtless from the high priest of the Jews, in his
   spiritual representation of the church before God. He had a breastplate
   which he is said to wear on his heart, <reference osisRef="Exod.28.29">Exodus 28:29</reference>, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   names of the children of Israel were engraven, after the manner of
   seals or signets, and he bare them for a memorial before the Lord. He
   had the like also upon his shoulders, or on his arms, verses 11, 12;
   both representing the priesthood of Christ, who bears the names of all
   his before his Father in the "holy of holies," <reference osisRef="Heb.9.24">Hebrews 9:24</reference> Now the
   seal on the heart, is near, inward, tender love and care, which gives
   an impression and image on the heart of the thing so loved. "Set me,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the spouse, "as a seal upon your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> heart;" -- "Let me be
   constantly fixed in your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> most tender and affectionate love; let me
   always have a place in your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> heart; let me have an engraving, a mighty
   impression of love, upon your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> heart, that shall never be obliterated."
   The soul is never satisfied with thoughts of Christ's love to it. "O
   that it were more, that it were more! that I were as a seal on his
   heart!'?" is its language. The soul knows, indeed, on serious thoughts,
   that the love of Christ is inconceivable, and cannot be increased; but
   it would fain work up itself to an apprehension of it: and therefore
   she adds here, "Set me as a seal upon your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> arm." The heart is the
   fountain, but close and hidden; the arm is manifestation and power.
   "Let," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the spouse, "your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> love be manifested to me in your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> tender
   and powerful persuasion of me." Two things are evident in this
   request:  the continual mindfulness of Christ of the soul, as having
   its condition still in his eye, engraven on his arm, <reference osisRef="Isa.49.15-Isa.49.16">Isaiah 49:15-16</reference>,
   with the exalting of his power for the preservation of it, suitable to
   the love of his heart to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it; and the manifestation of the hidden love
   and care of the heart of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the soul, being made visible on
   his arm, or evident by the fruit of it. This is that which she would be
   assured of; and without a sense of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> there is no rest to be
   obtained.
				</p><p>
   The reason she gives of this earnestness in her supplications, is that
   which principally evinces her delight in him: "Love is strong as death,
   jealousy is cruel as the grave," or "hard as hell." This is the
   intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of what is so loftily set out by so many metaphors in this
   and the following verse:  "I am not able to bear the workings of my
   love to you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, unless I may always have society and fellowship with
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>. There is no satisfying of my love without it. It is as the [241]
   grave, that still says Give, give. Death is not satisfied without its
   prey; if it have not all, it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> nothing: let what will happen, if
   death has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not its whole desire, it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> nothing at all. Nor can it be
   withstood in its appointed season; no ransom will be taken. So is my
   love; if I have you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> not wholly, I have nothing. Nor can all the world
   bribe it to a diversion; it will he no more turned aside than death in
   its time. Also, I am not able to bear my jealous thoughts: I fear you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note>
   dost not love me, that you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> forsaken me; because I know I deserve
   not to be beloved. These thoughts are hard as hell; they give no rest
   to my soul: if I find not myself on your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> heart and arm, I am as one that
   lies down in a bed of coals." This also argues a holy greediness of
   delight.
				</p><p>
   3. She farther manifests this by her solicitousness, trouble, and
   perplexity, in his loss and withdrawings. Men bewail the loss of that
   whose whole enjoyment they delight in; we easily bear the absence of
   that whose presence is not delightful. This state of the spouse is
   discovered, <reference osisRef="Song.3.1-Song.3.3">Song of Solomon 3:1-3</reference>, "By [242] night on my bed I sought him whom
   [243] my soul loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>: I sought him, but I found him not. I will rise
   now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will
   seek him whom my soul loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>: I sought him, but I found him not. The
   watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him
   whom my soul loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>?" It is night now with the soul, -- a time of
   darkness and trouble, or affliction. Whenever Christ is absent, it is
   night with a believer. He is the [244] sun; if he go down upon them, if
   his beams be eclipsed, if in his light they see no light, it is all
   darkness with them. Here, whether the coming of the night of any
   trouble on her made her discover Christ's absence, or the absence of
   Christ made it night with her, is not expressed. I rather think the
   latter; because, setting that aside, all things seem to be well with
   her. The absence of Christ will indeed make it night, dark as darkness
   itself, in the midst of all other glowing consolations. But is the
   spouse contented with this dispensation? She is upon her bed, -- that
   is, of ease (the bed, indeed, sometimes signifies tribulation, <reference osisRef="Rev.2.22">Revelation of John 2:22</reference>; but in this book, everywhere, rest and contentment: here is not the
   least intimation of any tribulation but what is in the want of Christ);
   but in the greatest peace and opportunity of ease and rest, a believer
   finds none in the absence of Christ: though he be on his bed, having
   nothing to disquiet him, he rests not, if Christ, his rest, be not
   there. She "sought him." Seeking of Christ by night, on the bed (that
   is, alone, in immediate inquest, and in the dark), has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> two parts: 
   searching of our own souls for the cause of his absence; secondly,
   searching the promises for his presence.
				</p><p>
   (1.) The soul finding not Christ present in his wonted manner, warming,
   cherishing, reviving it with love, nigh to it, supping with it, always
   filling its thoughts with himself, dropping myrrh and sweet tastes of
   love into it; but, on the contrary, that other thoughts crowd in and
   perplex the heart, and Christ is not nigh when inquired after; it
   presently inquires into the cause of all this, [245] calls itself to an
   account what it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done, how it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> behaved itself, that it is not
   with it as at other times, -- that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> withdrawn himself, and
   is not nigh to it in the wonted manner. Here it accomplishes a diligent
   search; it considers the love, tenderness, and kindness of the Lord
   Jesus, what delight he takes in abiding with his saints, so that his
   departure is not without cause and provocation. "How," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> it, "have
   I demeaned myself, that I have lost my Beloved? where have I been
   wandering after other lovers?" And when the miscarriage is found out,
   it abounds in revenge and indignation.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Having driven this to some issue, the soul applies<note n="applieth">Auto-modernized</note> itself to the
   promises of the covenant, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Christ is most graciously exhibited
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it; considers one, ponders another, to find a taste of him; -- it
   considers diligently if it can see the delightful countenance and
   favour of Christ in them or no. But now, if (as it often falls out) the
   soul finds nothing but the carcase, but the bare letter, in the
   promise, -- if it come to it as to the grave of Christ, of which it may
   be said (not in itself, but in respect of the seeking soul), "He is
   risen, he is not here," -- this amazes the soul, and it knows not what
   to do. As a man that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a jewel of great price, having no occasion to
   use it, lays it aside, as he supposes, in a safe place; in an agony and
   extremity of want going to seek for his jewel, he finds it not in the
   place he expected, and is filled with amazement, and knows not what to
   do; -- so is it with this pearl of the gospel. After a man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sold
   all that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> for it, and enjoyed it for a season, then to have it
   missing at a time of need, it must needs perplex him. So was it with
   the spouse here. "I sought him," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> she, "but I found him not;" a
   thing which not seldom befalls us in our communion with Christ.
				</p><p>
   But what does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> she now do? does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> she give over, and search no more? Nay;
   but says she, verse 2, "?I will arise;' I will not so give over. I must
   have Christ, or die. I will now arise," (or, "let me arise,") "and go
   about this business."
				</p><p>
   [1.] She resolves to put herself upon another course, a more vigorous
   inquest: "I will arise and make use of other means besides those of
   private prayer, meditation, self-searching, and inquiring into the
   promises;" which she had insisted on before. It carries, --
				</p><p>
   1st. Resolution, and a zealous, violent casting off that frame in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   she had lost her love. "?I [246] will arise;' I will not rest in this
   frame: I am undone if I do." So, sometimes God calls his church to
   arise and shake itself out of the dust. Abide not in that condition.
				</p><p>
   2dly. Diligence. "I will now take another course; I will leave no way
   unattempted, no means untried, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> I may possibly recover communion
   with my Beloved."
				</p><p>
   This is the condition of a soul that finds not the wonted presence of
   Christ in its private and more retired inquiries, -- dull in prayer,
   wandering in meditations, rare in thoughts of him, -- "I will not bear
   this frame: whatever way God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed, I will, in his strength,
   vigorously pursue, until this frame be altered, and I find my Beloved."
				</p><p>
   [2.] Then the way she puts herself upon, is to go about the city. Not
   to insist upon particulars, nor to strain the parts of the allegory too
   far, the city here intended is the city of God, the church; and the
   passing through the broad and narrow streets, is the diligent inquiry
   that the spouse makes in all the paths and ordinances given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it.
   This, then, is the next thing the soul addresses itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in the
   want of Christ:  when it finds him not in any private endeavours, it
   makes vigorous application to the ordinances of public worship; in
   prayer, in preaching, in administration of the seals, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it look
   after Christ. Indeed, the great inquiry the souls of believers make, in
   every ordinance, is after Christ. So much as they find of him, so much
   sweetness and refreshment have they, and no more. Especially when under
   any desertion, they rise up to this inquiry: they listen to every word,
   to every prayer, to find if any thing of Christ, any light from him,
   any life, any love, appears to them. "Oh, that Christ would at length
   meet me in this or that sermon, and recover my poor heart to some sight
   of his love, -- to some taste at kindness!" The solicitousness of a
   believer in his inquest after Christ, when he finds not his presence,
   either for grace or consolation, as in former days, is indeed
   inexpressible. Much of the frame of such a heart is couched in the
   redoubling of the expression, "I sought him, I sought him;" setting out
   an inconceivable passion, and suitably industrious desire. Thus, being
   disappointed at home, the spouse proceeds.
				</p><p>
   But yet see the event of this also: "She sought him, but found him
   not." It does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> sometimes so fall out, all will not do: "They shall seek
   him, and not find him;" they shall not come nigh him. Let them that
   enjoy any thing of the presence of Christ take heed what they do; if
   they provoke him to depart, if they lose him, it may cost them many a
   bitter inquiry before they find him again. When a soul prays and
   meditates, searches the promises in private; when it with earnestness
   and diligence attends all ordinances in public, and all to get one
   glimpse of the face of Jesus Christ, and all in vain, it is a sad
   condition.
				</p><p>
   What now follows in this estate? Verse 3, "The watchmen found me," etc.
   That these watchmen of the city of God are the watchmen and officers of
   the church, is confessed. And it is of sad consideration, that the Holy
   Ghost does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> sometimes in this book take notice of them on no good
   account. Plainly, chap. v. 7, they turn persecutors. It was Luther's
   saying, "Nunquam periclitatur religio nisi inter reverendissimos." Here
   they are of a more gentle temper, and seeing the poor disconsolate
   soul, they seem to take notice of her condition.
				</p><p>
   It is the duty, indeed, of faithful watchmen, to take notice of poor,
   troubled, deserted souls; -- not to keep at a distance, but to be
   willing to assist. And a truly pressed soul on the account of Christ's
   absence cannot cover its love, but must be inquiring after him: "Saw ye
   him whom my soul loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>?" -- "This is my condition: I have had sweet
   enjoyment of my blessed Jesus, -- he is now withdrawn from me. Can you
   help me? can you guide me to my consolation. What acquaintance have you
   with him? when saw you him? how did he manifest himself to you, and
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>?" All these labourings in his absence sufficiently discover the
   soul's delight in the presence of Christ. Go one step farther, to the
   discovery that it made of him once again, and it will yet be more
   evident. Verses 4, 5, "It was but a little that I passed from them, but
   I found him whom my soul loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>: I held him, and would not let him go,
   until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of
   her that conceived me. I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem," etc.
				</p><p>
   First, She tells you how she came to him: "She found him;" -- what ways
   and by what means is not expressed. It often so falls out in our
   communion with Christ, when private and public means fail, and the soul
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> nothing left but waiting silently and walking humbly, Christ
   appears; that his so doing may be evidently of grace. Let us not at any
   time give over in this condition. When all ways are past, the summer
   and harvest are gone without relief, -- when neither bed nor watchmen
   can assist, -- let us wait a little, and we shall see the Salvation of
   God. Christ honours his immediate absolute actings sometimes, though
   ordinarily he crowns his ordinances. Christ often manifests himself
   immediately, and out of ordinances, to them that wait for him in them;
   -- that he will do so to them that despise them, I know not. Though he
   will meet men unexpectedly in his way, yet he will not meet them at all
   out of it. Let us wait as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed; let him appear as he
   pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>. How she deals with him when found is nextly declared: "She
   held him, and would not let him go," etc. They are all expressions of
   the greatest joy and delight imaginable. The sum is:  having at length
   come once more to an enjoyment of sweet communion with Christ, the soul
   lays fast hold on him by faith (kratein, "to hold fast," is an act of
   faith), refuses to part with him any more, in vehemency of love, --
   tries to keep him in ordinances in the house of its mother, the church
   of God; and so uses all means for the confirming of the mutual love
   between Christ and her: all the expressions, all the allusions used,
   evidencing delight to the utmost capacity of the soul. Should I pursue
   all the instances and testimonies that are given to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, in that one
   book of the Song of Solomon, I must enter upon an exposition of the
   greatest part of it; which is not my present business. Let the hearts
   of the saints that are acquainted with these things be allowed to make
   the close. What is it they long for, they rejoice in? what is it that
   satisfies them to the utmost, and gives sweet complacency to their
   spirits in every condition? what is it whose loss they fear, whose
   absence they cannot bear? Is it not this their Beloved, and he alone?
				</p><p>
   This, also, they farther manifest by their delight in every thing that
   peculiarly belongs to Christ, as his, in this world. This is an
   evidence of delight, when, for his sake whom we delight in, we also
   delight in every thing that belongs to him. Christ's great interest in
   this world lies in his people and his ordinances, -- his household and
   their provision. Now in both these do the saints exceedingly delight,
   for his sake. Take an instance in both kinds in one man, namely, David,
   <reference osisRef="Ps.16.3">Psalms 16:3</reference>, "In the saints and the excellent" (or the noble) "of the
   earth is all my delight; my delight in them." Christ says of his church
   that she is "Hephzi-bah," Isa. lxii., "My delight in her." Here says
   David of the same, "Hephzi-bam, -- "My delight in them." As Christ
   delights in his saints, so do they in one another, on his account.
   "Here," says David, "is all my delight." Whatever contentment he took
   in any other persons, it was nothing in comparison of the delight he
   took in them. Hence, mention is made of "laying down our lives for the
   brethren," or any common cause in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the interest of the community of
   the brethren does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> lie.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, For the ordinances, consider the same person. Ps. xlii.,
   lxxxiv., and xlviii., are such plentiful testimonies throughout, as we
   need no farther inquiring; nor shall I go forth to a new discourse on
   this particular.
				</p><p>
   And this is the first mutual consequential act of conjugal affection,
   in this communion between Christ and believers:  he delights in them,
   and they delight in him. He delights in their prosperity, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> pleasure
   in it; they delight in his honour and glory, and in his presence with
   them. For his sake they delight in his servants (though by the world
   contemned) as the most excellent in the world; and in his ordinances,
   as the wisdom of God; -- which are foolishness to the world.

<title>Part 2 Chapter 5</title>
<p>
   Other consequential affections:  1. On the part of Christ -- He values
   his saints -- Evidences of that valuation:  (1.) His incarnation; (2.)
   Exinanition, <reference osisRef="2Cor.8.9">2 Corinthians 8:9</reference>; <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6-Phil.2.7">Philippians 2:6-7</reference>; (3.) Obedience as a
   servant; (4.) In his death. His valuation of them in comparison of
   others. 2. Believers' estimation of Christ:  (1.) They value him above
   all other things and persons; (2.) Above their own lives; (3.) All
   spiritual excellencies. The sum of all on the part of Christ -- The sum
   on the part of believers. The third conjugal affection -- On the part
   of Christ, pity or compassion -- In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> manifested -- Suffering and
   supply, fruits of compassion -- Several ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> Christ relieves
   the saints under temptations -- His compassion in their afflictions.
   Chastity, the third conjugal affection in the saints. The fourth -- On
   the part of Christ, bounty; on the part of the saints, duty.
				</p><p>
   II. Christ values his saints, values believers (which is the second
   branch of that conjugal affection he bears towards them), having taken
   them into the relation of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak. I shall not need to insist
   long on the demonstration of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>; heaven and earth are full of
   evidences of it. Some few considerations will give life to the
   assertion. Consider them, then, -- 1. Absolutely; 2. In respect of
   others; and you will see what a valuation he puts upon them: 
				</p><p>
   1. All that ever he did or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, all that ever he underwent or suffered
   as mediator, was for their sakes. Now, these things were so great and
   grievous, that had he not esteemed them above all that can be
   expressed, he had never engaged to their performance and undergoing.
   Take a few instances: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) For their sakes was he "made [247] flesh;" "manifested in the
   flesh." <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference>, "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of
   flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same." And
   the height of this valuation of them the apostle aggravates. Verse 16,
   "Verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the
   seed of Abraham;" he had no such esteem of angels. Whether you take
   epilambamesthai, properly to "take," or to "take hold of," as our
   translators, and so supply the word "nature," and refer the whole to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ's incarnation, who in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> took our nature on him, and not the
   nature of angels; or for analambanesthai, to "help," (he did not help
   nor succour fallen angels, but he did help and [248] succour the seed
   of Abraham,) and so consider it as the fruit of Christ's incarnation,
   -- it is all one, as to our present business: his preferring the seed
   of Abraham before angels, his valuing them above the other, is plainly
   expressed. And observe, that he came to help the seed of Abraham, --
   that is, [249] believers. His esteem and valuation is of them only.
				</p><p>
   (2.) For their sakes he was so made flesh, as that there was an
   emptying, an exinanition of himself, and an eclipsing of his glory, and
   a becoming poor for them, <reference osisRef="2Cor.8.9">2 Corinthians 8:9</reference>, "Ye know the grace of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for our sakes he
   became poor." Being rich in eternal glory with his Father, <reference osisRef="John.17.5">John 17:5</reference>, he became poor for believers. The same person that was rich was also
   poor. That the riches here meant can be none but those of the Deity, is
   evident, by its opposition to the poverty which as man he undertook.
   This is also more fully expressed, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6-Phil.2.7">Philippians 2:6-7</reference>, "Who being in the
   form of God, counted it no robbery to be equal to God, but he emptied
   himself, taking the form of a servant, and being made in the fashion of
   a man, and found in form as a man," etc. That the "form of God" is here
   the essence of the Deity, sundry things inevitably evince; as, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] That he was in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> [250] equal to God; that is, his Father. Now,
   nothing but God is equal to God. Not [251] Christ as he is mediator, in
   his greatest glory, -- nothing but that which is infinite, is equal to
   that which is infinite.
				</p><p>
   [2.] The form of God is opposed to the form of a servant; and that form
   of a servant is called the "fashion of a man," verse 8, -- that fashion
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was found when he gave himself to death, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> as a man he
   poured out his blood and died. Morphen doulou labon, (he "took the form
   of a servant"), is expounded in the next words, en homoiomati anthropon
   genomenos, -- an expression used to set out his incarnation, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.3">Romans 8:3</reference> God sent him en homoiomati sarkos hamartias; in taking true flesh,
   he was in the "likeness of sinful flesh." Now, in thus doing, it is
   said heauton ekenose, -- "he humbled, emptied himself, made himself of
   no reputation." In the very taking of flesh, there was a condescension,
   a debasing of the person of the Son of God; it could not be without it.
   If God humbled himself to "behold the things that are in heaven, and in
   the earth," <reference osisRef="Ps.113.6">Psalms 113:6</reference>, then certainly it was an inconceivable
   condescension and abasement, not only to behold, but take upon him
   (into personal union) our nature with himself. And though nothing could
   possibly be taken off from the essential glory of the Deity, yet that
   person appearing in the fashion of a man, and form of a servant, the
   glory of it, as to the manifestation, was eclipsed; and he appeared
   [252] quite another thing than what indeed he was, and had been from
   eternity. Hence he prays that his Father would "glorify him with the
   glory he had with him before the world was," <reference osisRef="John.17.5">John 17:5</reference>, as to the
   manifestation of it. And so, though the divine nature was not abased,
   the person was.
				</p><p>
   (3.) For their sakes he so humbled and emptied himself, in taking
   flesh, as to become in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> a servant, -- in the eyes of the world of
   no esteem nor account; and a true and real servant [253] to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Father. For their sakes he humbled himself, and became obedient. All
   that he did and suffered in his life comes under this consideration;
   all which may be referred to these three heads:  [254] [1.] Fulfilling
   all righteousness. [2.] Enduring all manner of persecutions and
   hardships. [3.] Doing all manner of good to men. He took on him, for
   their sakes, a life and course pointed to, <reference osisRef="Heb.5.7-Heb.5.8">Hebrews 5:7-8</reference>, -- a life of
   prayers, tears, fears, obedience, suffering; and all this with
   cheerfulness and delight, calling his employment his "meat and drink,"
   and still professing that the law of this obedience was in his [255]
   heart, -- that he was content to do this will of God. He that will
   sorely revenge the least opposition that is or shall be made to him by
   others, was content to undergo any thing, all things, for believers.
				</p><p>
   (4.) He stays not here, but (for the consummation of all that went
   before) for their sakes he becomes obedient to death, the death of the
   cross. So he professes<note n="professeth">Auto-modernized</note> to his Father, <reference osisRef="John.17.19">John 17:19</reference>, "For their sakes
   I sanctify myself;" -- "I dedicate myself as an offering, as a
   sacrifice, to be killed and slain." This was his aim in all the former,
   that he might die; he was born, and [256] lived, that he might die. He
   valued them above his life. And if we might stay to consider a little
   what was in this death that he underwent for them, we should perceive
   what a price indeed he put upon them. The curse [257] of the law was in
   it, the [258] wrath of God was in it, the loss of God's [259] presence
   was in it. It was a [260] fearful cup that he tasted of, and drank of,
   that they might never taste of it. A man would not for ten thousand
   worlds be willing to undergo that which Christ underwent for us in that
   one thing of desertion from God, were it attended with no more distress
   but what a mere creature might possibly emerge from under. And what
   thoughts we should have of this himself tells us, <reference osisRef="John.15.13">John 15:13</reference>, "Greater
   love has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
   friends." It is impossible there should be any greater demonstration or
   evidence of love than this. What can any one do more? And yet he tells
   us in another place, that it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> another aggravation and heightening,
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.8">Romans 5:8</reference>, "God commends<note n="commendeth">Auto-modernized</note> his love toward us, in that, while we were
   yet sinners, Christ died for us." When he did this for us we were
   sinners, and enemies, whom he might justly have destroyed. What more
   can be done? -- to die for us when we were sinners! Such a death, in
   such a manner, with such attendancies of wrath and curse, -- a death
   accompanied with the worst that God had ever threatened to sinners, --
   argues as high a valuation of us as the heart of Christ himself was
   capable of.
				</p><p>
   For one to part with his glory, his riches, his ease, his life, his
   love from God, to undergo loss, shame, wrath, curse, death, for
   another, is an evidence of a dear valuation; and that it was all on
   this account, we are informed, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.2">Hebrews 12:2</reference> Certainly Christ had a dear
   esteem of them, that, rather than they should perish, -- that they
   should not be his, and be made partakers of his glory, -- he would part
   with all he had for their sakes, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25-Eph.5.26">Ephesians 5:25-26</reference>
				</p><p>
   There would be no end, should I go through all the instances of
   Christ's valuation of believers, in all their deliverances,
   afflictions, in all conditions of sinning and suffering, -- what he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done, what he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> in his intercession, what he delivers them
   from, what he procures for them; all telling out this one thing, --
   they are the apple of his eye, his jewel, his diadem, his crown.
				</p><p>
   2. In comparison of others. All the world is nothing to him in
   comparison of them. They are his garden; the rest of the world, a
   wilderness. <reference osisRef="Song.4.12">Song of Solomon 4:12</reference>, "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a
   spring shut up, a fountain sealed." They are his inheritance; the rest,
   his enemies, of no regard with him. So <reference osisRef="Isa.43.3-Isa.43.4">Isaiah 43:3-4</reference>, "I am the Lord
   your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> God, the Holy One of Israel, your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Saviour: I gave Egypt for your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>. Since you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> were<note n="wast">Auto-modernized</note> [261] precious in
   my sight, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> been honourable, and I have loved you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>: therefore
   will I give men for you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, and people for your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> life." The reason of this
   dealing of Christ with his church, in parting with all others for them,
   is, because he loves her. She is precious and honourable in his sight;
   thence he puts this great esteem upon her. Indeed, he disposes<note n="disposeth">Auto-modernized</note> of all
   nations and their interests according as is for the good of believers.
   <reference osisRef="Amos.9.9">Amos 9:9</reference>, in all the siftings of the nations, the eye of God is upon
   the house of Israel; not a grain of them shall perish. Look to heaven;
   angels are appointed to minister for them, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.14">Hebrews 1:14</reference> Look into the
   world; the nations in general are either [262] blessed for their sakes,
   or [263] destroyed on their account, -- preserved to try them, or
   rejected for their cruelty towards them; and will receive from Christ
   their [264] final doom according to their deportment towards these
   despised ones. On this account are the pillars of the earth borne up,
   and patience is exercised towards the perishing world. In a word, there
   is not the meanest, the weakest, the poorest believer on the earth, but
   Christ prizes him more than all the world besides. Were our hearts
   filled much with thoughts of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, it would tend much to our
   consolation.
				</p><p>
   To answer this, believers also value Jesus Christ; they have an esteem
   of him above all the world, and all things in the world. You have been
   in part acquainted with this before, in the account that was given of
   their delight in him, and inquiry after him. They say of him in their
   hearts continually, as David, "Whom have I in heaven but you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>? and none
   upon earth I desire beside you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>." <reference osisRef="Ps.73.25">Psalms 73:25</reference> Neither heaven nor
   earth will yield them an object any way comparable to him, that they
   can delight in.
				</p><p>
   1. They value him above all other things and persons. "Mallem,", said
   one, [265] "ruere cum Christo, quam regnare cum Caesare. Pulchra terra,
   pulchrum coelum, sed pulcherrimus dominus Jesus;" -- Christ and a
   dungeon, Christ and a cross, is infinitely sweeter than a crown, a
   sceptre without him, to their souls. So was it with Moses, <reference osisRef="Heb.11.26">Hebrews 11:26</reference>,
   "He esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
   in Egypt." The reproach of Christ is the worst consequent that the
   wickedness of the world or the malice of Satan can bring upon the
   followers of him. The treasures of Egypt were in those days the
   greatest in the world; Moses despised the very best of the world, for
   the worst of the cross of Christ. Indeed, himself has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> told believers,
   that if they love any thing better than him, father or mother, they are
   not worthy of him. A despising of all things for Christ is the very
   first lesson of the gospel. "Give away all, take up the cross and
   follow me," was the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he tried his disciples of old; and if
   there be not the same mind and heart in us, we are none of his.
				</p><p>
   2. They value him above their lives. <reference osisRef="Acts.20.24">Acts 20:24</reference>, "My life is not dear,
   that I may perfect my course with joy, and the ministry I have received
   of the Lord Jesus;" -- "Let life and all go, so that I may serve him;
   and, when all is done, enjoy him, and be made like to him." It is known
   what is reported of [266] Ignatius when he was led to martyrdom: "Let
   what will," said he, "come upon me, only so I may obtain Jesus Christ."
   Hence they of old rejoiced when whipped, scourged, put to shame, for
   his sake, <reference osisRef="Acts.5.41">Acts 5:41</reference>; Heb. xi. All is welcome that comes from him, or
   for him. The lives they have to live, the death they have to die, is
   little, is light, upon the thoughts of him who is the stay of their
   lives and the end of their death. Were it not for the refreshment which
   daily they receive by thoughts of him, they could not live, -- their
   lives would be a burden to them; and the thoughts of enjoyment of him
   made them cry with Paul, "Oh that we were dissolved!" The stories of
   the martyrs of old and of late, the sufferers in giving witness to him
   under the dragon and under the false prophet, the neglect of life in
   women and children on his account, contempt of torments, while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> his
   name sweetened all, have rendered this truth clear to men and angels.
				</p><p>
   3. They value him above all spiritual excellencies, and all other
   righteousness whatever, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.7-Phil.3.8">Philippians 3:7-8</reference>, "Those things which were
   advantage to me, I esteemed loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus my Lord; for whose sake I have lost all things, and do
   esteem them common, that I may gain Christ, and be found in him."
   Having recounted the excellencies which he had, and the privileges
   which he enjoyed, in his Judaism, -- which were all of a spiritual
   nature, and a participation in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> made the rest of his countrymen
   despise all the world, and look upon themselves as the only acceptable
   persons with God, resting on them for righteousness, -- the apostle
   tells us what is his esteem of them, in comparison of the Lord Jesus.
   They are "loss and dung," -- things that for his sake he had really
   suffered the loss of; that is, whereas he had for many years been a
   zealot of the law, -- seeking after a righteousness as it were by the
   works of it, <reference osisRef="Rom.9.32">Romans 9:32</reference>, -- instantly serving God day and night, to
   obtain the promise, <reference osisRef="Acts.26.7">Acts 26:7</reference>, -- living in all good conscience from
   his youth, Acts xxiii., -- all the while very zealous for God and his
   institutions, -- now [he] willingly casts away all these things, looks
   upon them as loss and dung, and could not only be contented to be
   without them, but, as for that end for which he sought after them, he
   abhorred them all. When men have been strongly convinced of their duty,
   and have laboured many years to keep a [267] good conscience, -- have
   prayed, and heard, and done good, and denied themselves, and been [268]
   zealous for God, and laboured with all their might to [269] please him,
   and so at length to come to enjoy him; they had rather [270] part with
   all the world, life and all, than with this they have wrought. You know
   how unwilling we are to part with any thing we have laboured and beaten
   our heads about? How much more when the things are so excellent, as our
   duty to God, blamelessness of conversation, hope of heaven, and the
   like, which we have beaten our hearts about. But now, when once Christ
   appears to the soul, when he is known in his excellency, all these
   things, as without him, have their paint washed off, their beauty
   fades, their desirableness vanishes<note n="vanisheth">Auto-modernized</note>, and the soul is not only
   contented to part with them all, but puts them away as a defiled thing,
   and cries, "In the Lord Jesus only is my righteousness [271] and
   glory." <reference osisRef="Prov.3.13-Prov.3.15">Proverbs 3:13-15</reference>, among innumerable testimonies, may be
   admitted to give witness to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, "Happy is the man that finds<note n="findeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   wisdom, and the man that gets<note n="getteth">Auto-modernized</note> understanding. For the merchandise of
   it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> than
   fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: and all the things that
   you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> can<note n="canst">Auto-modernized</note> desire are not to be compared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> her." It is of Jesus
   Christ, the Wisdom of God, the eternal Wisdom of the Father, that the
   Holy Ghost speaks; as is evident from the description which is given
   of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, chap. viii. He and his ways are better than silver and gold,
   rubies, and all desirable things; as in the gospel he likens himself to
   the [272] "pearl in the field," which when the merchant man finds, he
   sells all that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, to purchase. All goes for Christ; -- all
   righteousness without him, all ways of religion, all goes for that one
   pearl. The glory of his Deity, the excellency of his person, his
   all-conquering desirableness, ineffable love, wonderful undertaking,
   unspeakable condescensions, effectual mediation, complete
   righteousness, lie in their eyes, ravish their hearts, fill their
   affections, and possess their souls. And this is the second mutual
   conjugal affection between Christ and believers; all which, on the part
   of Christ, may be referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> two heads: 
				</p><p>
   1. All that he parted withal, all that he did, all that he suffered,
   all that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> as mediator; he parted withal, did, suffered, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, on
   the account of his [273] love to and esteem of believers. He parted
   with the greatest glory, he underwent the greatest misery, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   greatest works that ever were, because he loves his spouse, -- because
   he values believers. What can more, what can farther be spoken? how
   little is the depth of that which is spoken fathomed! how unable are we
   to look into the mysterious recesses of it! He so loves, so values his
   saints, as that, having from eternity undertaken to bring them to God,
   he rejoices his soul in the thoughts of it; and pursues his design
   through heaven and hell, life and death, by suffering and doing, in
   mercy and with power; and ceases<note n="ceaseth">Auto-modernized</note> not until he bring it to perfection.
   For, --
				</p><p>
   2. He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so value them, as that he will not lose any of them to
   eternity, though all the world should combine to take them out of his
   hand. When in the days of his flesh he foresaw what opposition, what
   danger, what rocks they should meet withal, he cried out, "Holy Father,
   keep them," <reference osisRef="John.17.11">John 17:11</reference>; -- "Let not one of them be lost;" and tells
   us plainly, <reference osisRef="John.10.28">John 10:28</reference>, that no man shall take his sheep out of his
   hand. And because he was then in the form of a servant, and it might be
   supposed that he might not be able to hold them, he tells them true, as
   to his present condition of carrying on the work of mediation, his
   "Father was greater than he;" [274] and therefore to him he committed
   them, and none should take them out of his Father's hand, <reference osisRef="John.10.29">John 10:29</reference>
   And whereas the world, afflictions, and persecutions, which are
   without, may be conquered, and yet no security given but that sin from
   within, by the assistance of Satan, may prevail against them to their
   ruin; as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided against Satan, in his promise that the gates
   of hell shall not prevail against them, so he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taken care that sin
   itself shall not destroy them. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, indeed, is the depth of his love
   to be contemplated, that whereas his holy soul hates every sin (it is a
   burden, an abomination, a new wound to him), and his poor spouse is
   sinful (believers are full of sins, failings, and infirmities), he
   hides all, covers all, bears with all, rather than he will lose them;
   by his power preserving them from such sins as a remedy is not provided
   for in the covenant of grace. Oh, the world of sinful follies that our
   dear Lord Jesus bears withal on this account! Are not our own souls
   astonished with the thoughts of it? Infinite patience, infinite
   forbearance, infinite love, infinite grace, infinite mercy, are all set
   on work for this end, to answer this his valuation of us.
				</p><p>
   On our part it may also be referred to two heads: 
				</p><p>
   1. That, upon the discovery of him to our souls, they rejoice to [275]
   part with all things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they have delighted or reposed their
   confidence, for him and his sake, that they may enjoy him. Sin and
   lust, pleasure and profit, righteousness and duty, in their several
   conditions, all shall go, so they may have Christ.
				</p><p>
   2. That they are willing to part with all things rather than with [276]
   him, when they do enjoy him. To think of parting with peace, health,
   liberty, relations, wives, children; it is offensive, heavy, and
   grievous to the best of the saints: but their souls cannot bear the
   thoughts of parting with Jesus Christ; such a thought is cruel as the
   grave. The worst thoughts that, in any fear, [277] in desertions, they
   have of [278] hell, is, that they shall not enjoy Jesus Christ. So they
   may enjoy him here, hereafter be like him, be ever with him, stand in
   his presence; they can part with all things freely, cheerfully, be they
   never so beautiful, in reference to this life or that which is to come.
				</p><p>
   III. The third conjugal affection on the part of Christ is pity and
   compassion. As a man "nourishes<note n="nourisheth">Auto-modernized</note> and cherishes<note n="cherisheth">Auto-modernized</note> his [279] own flesh, so
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord his church," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.29">Ephesians 5:29</reference> Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a fellow feeling
   with his saints in all their troubles, as a man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> with his own
   flesh. This act of the conjugal love of Christ relates to the many
   trials and pressures of afflictions that his saints meet withal here
   below. He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not deal with believers as the Samaritans with the Jews,
   that fawned on them in their prosperity, but despised them in their
   trouble; he is as a tender [280] father, who, though perhaps he love
   all his children alike, yet he will take most pains with, and give most
   of his presence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, one that is sick and weak, though in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> and
   thereby he may be made most froward, and, as it should seem, hardest to
   be borne with. And (which is more than the pity of any father can
   extend to) he himself suffers with them, and takes share in all their
   troubles.
				</p><p>
   Now, all the sufferings of the saints in this world, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> their head
   and husband exercises<note n="exerciseth">Auto-modernized</note> pity, tenderness, care, and compassion towards
   them, are of two sorts, or may be referred to two heads:  1.
   Temptations. 2. Afflictions.
				</p><p>
   1. Temptations (under which head I comprise sin also, whereto they
   tend); as in, from, and by their own infirmities; as also from their
   adversaries without. The frame of the heart of Christ, and his
   deportment towards them in this condition, you have, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.15">Hebrews 4:15</reference>, "We
   have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities." We have not such a one as cannot. The two negations do
   vehemently affirm that we have such an high priest as can be, or is,
   touched. The word "touched" comes exceedingly short of expressing the
   original word; it is [281] sumpathesai, -- to "suffer together." "We
   have," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle, "such an high priest as can, and consequently
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, suffer with us, -- endure our infirmities." And in what respect
   he suffers with us in regard of our infirmities, or has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a
   fellow-feeling with us in them, he declares in the next words, "He was
   tempted like as we are," verse 15. It is as to our [282] infirmities,
   our temptations, spiritual weakness; in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, in particular, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he a
   compassionate sympathy and fellow-feeling with us. Whatever be our
   infirmities, so far as they are our temptations, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> suffer with us
   under them, and compassionates us. Hence at the last [283] day he
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "I was an hungered," etc. There are two ways of expressing a
   fellow-feeling and suffering with another:  (1.) Per benevolam
   condolentiam, -- a "friendly grieving." (2.) Per gratiosam
   opitulationem, -- a "gracious supply:" both are eminent in Christ: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) He [284] grieves and labours with us. <reference osisRef="Zech.1.12">Zechariah 1:12</reference>, "The angel of
   the Lord answered and said, O Lord of hosts, how long will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> not
   have mercy on Jerusalem?" He speaks as one intimately affected with the
   state and condition of poor Jerusalem; and therefore he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> bid all
   the world take notice that what is done to them is done to him, chap.
   ii. 8, 9; yea, to "the [285] apple of his eye."
				</p><p>
   (2.) In the second he abounds. <reference osisRef="Isa.40.11">Isaiah 40:11</reference>, "He shall feed his flock
   like a shepherd, he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them
   in his bosom, and gently lead them that are with young." Yea, we have
   both here together, -- tender compassionateness and assistance. The
   whole frame in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is here described is a [286] frame of the
   greatest [287] tenderness, compassion, condescension that can be
   imagined. His people are set forth under many infirmities; some are
   lambs, some great with young, some very tender, some burdened with
   temptations, -- nothing in any of them all strong or comely. To them
   all Christ is [288] a shepherd, that feeds his own sheep, and drives
   them out to pleasant pasture; where, if he sees a poor weak lamb, [he]
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not thrust him on, but takes him into his bosom, where he both
   eases<note n="easeth">Auto-modernized</note> and refreshes<note n="refresheth">Auto-modernized</note> him: he leads him gently and tenderly. As did
   Jacob them that were burdened with [289] young, so does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> our dear Lord
   Jesus with his flock, in the several ways and paths in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he leads
   them. When he sees a poor soul, weak, tender, halting, ready to sink
   and perish, he takes him into his arms, by some gracious promise
   administered to him, carries him, bears him up when he is not able to
   go one step forward. Hence is his great quarrel with those shepherds,
   <reference osisRef="Ezek.34.4">Ezekiel 34:4</reference>, "Woe be to you shepherds! the diseased have ye not
   strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have
   ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that
   which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost."
   This is that which our careful, tender husband would have done.
				</p><p>
   So mention being made of his compassionateness and fellow-suffering
   with us, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.15">Hebrews 4:15</reference>, it is added, verse 16, that he administers charin
   eis eukairon boetheian, -- seasonable grace, grace for help in a time
   of need. This is an evidence of compassion, when, like the Samaritan,
   we afford seasonable help. To lament our troubles or miseries, without
   affording help, is to no purpose. Now, this Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>; he gives
   eukairon boetheian, -- seasonable help. Help being a thing that regards
   want, is always excellent; but its coming in season puts a crown upon
   it. A pardon to a malefactor when he is ready to be executed, is sweet
   and welcome. Such is the assistance given by Christ. All his saints may
   take this as a sure rule, both in their temptations and afflictions: 
   when they can want them, they shall not want relief; and when they can
   bear no longer, they shall be relieved, <reference osisRef="1Cor.10.13">1 Corinthians 10:13</reference>
				</p><p>
   So it is said emphatically of him, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.18">Hebrews 2:18</reference>, "In that he himself
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are
   tempted." It is true, there is something in all our temptations more
   than was in the temptation of Christ. There is something in ourselves
   to take part with every temptation; and there is enough in ourselves to
   [290] tempt us, though nothing else should appear against us. With
   Christ it was not so, <reference osisRef="John.14.30">John 14:30</reference> But this is so far from taking off
   his compassion towards us, that, on all accounts whatever, it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   increase it; for if he will give us succour because we are tempted, the
   sorer our temptations are, the more ready will he be to succour us.
   Take some instances of Christ's giving eukairon boetheian, --
   seasonable help in and under temptations to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sin. Now this he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   several ways: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] By keeping the soul which is liable to temptation and exposed to
   it, in a strong habitual bent against that sin that he is obnoxious to
   the assaults of. So it was in the case of Joseph: Christ knew that
   Joseph's great trial, and that whereon if he had been conquered he had
   been undone, would lie upon the hand of his mistress tempting him to
   lewdness; whereupon he kept his heart in a steady frame against that
   sin, as his answer without the least deliberation argues, <reference osisRef="Gen.39.9">Genesis 39:9</reference> In other things, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was not so deeply concerned, Joseph's
   heart was not so fortified by habitual grace; as it appears by his
   swearing by the [291] life of Pharaoh. This is one way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> Christ
   gives suitable help to his, in tenderness and compassion. The saints,
   in the course of their lives, by the company, society, business, they
   are cast upon, are liable and exposed to temptations great and violent,
   some in one kind, some in another. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is Christ exceedingly kind
   and tender to them, in fortifying their hearts with abundance of grace
   as to that sin to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> temptations to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they are most exposed; when
   perhaps in other things they are very weak, and are often surprised.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Christ sometimes, by some strong impulse of actual grace, recovers
   the soul from the very borders of sin. So it was in the case of David,
   <reference osisRef="1Sam.24.4-1Sam.24.6">1 Samuel 24:4-6</reference> "He was almost gone," as he speaks himself; "his feet
   had well-nigh slipped." The temptation was at the door of prevalence,
   when a mighty impulse of grace recovers him. To show his saints what
   they are, their own weakness and infirmity, he sometimes suffers them
   to go to the very edge and brow of the hill, and then causes<note n="causeth">Auto-modernized</note> them to
   hear a word behind them saying, "This is the right way, walk in it," --
   and that with power and efficacy; and so recovers them to himself.
				</p><p>
   [3.] By taking away the temptation itself, when it grows so strong and
   violent that the poor soul knows not what to do. This is called
   "delivering the godly out of temptation," <reference osisRef="2Pet.2.9">2 Peter 2:9</reference>, as a man is
   plucked out of the snare, and the snare left behind to hold another.
   This have I known to be the case of many, in sundry perplexing
   temptations. When they have been quite weary, have tried all means of
   help and assistance, and have not been able to come to a comfortable
   issue, on a sudden, unexpectedly, the Lord Christ, in his tenderness
   and compassion, rebukes Satan, that they hear not one word more of him
   as to their temptation. Christ comes in in the storm, and says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>,
   "Peace, be still."
				</p><p>
   [4.] By giving in fresh supplies of grace, according as temptations do
   grow or increase. So was it in the case of Paul, <reference osisRef="2Cor.12.9">2 Corinthians 12:9</reference>, "My
   grace is sufficient for you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>." The temptation, whatever it were, grew
   high; Paul was earnest for its removal; and receives only this answer,
   of the sufficiency of the grace of God for his support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note>,
   notwithstanding all the growth and increase of the temptation.
				</p><p>
   [5.] By giving them wisdom to make a right, holy, and spiritual
   improvement of all temptations. James bids us "count it all joy when we
   fall into divers temptations," <reference osisRef="Jas.1.2">James 1:2</reference>: which could not be done were
   there not a holy and spiritual use to be made of them; which also
   himself manifests in the words following. There are manifold uses of
   temptations, which experienced Christians, with assistance suitable
   from Christ, may make of them. This is not the least, that by them we
   are brought to know ourselves. So Hezekiah was left to be tried, to
   know what was in him. By temptation, some bosom, hidden corruption is
   oftentimes discovered, that the soul knew not of before. As it was with
   [292] Hazael in respect of enormous crimes, so in lesser things with
   the saints. They would never have believed there had been such lusts
   and corruptions in them as they have discovered upon their temptations.
   Yea, divers having been tempted to one sin, have discovered another
   that they thought not of; as some, being tempted to pride, or
   worldliness, or looseness of conversation, have been startled by it,
   and led to a discovery of neglect of many duties and much communion
   with God, which before they thought not of. And this is from the tender
   care of Jesus Christ, giving them in suitable help; without which no
   man can possibly make use of or improve a temptation. And this is a
   suitable help indeed, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> a temptation which otherwise, or to other
   persons, might be a deadly wound, proves the lancing of a festered
   sore, and the letting out of corruption that otherwise might have
   endangered the life itself. So, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.6">1 Peter 1:6</reference>, "If need be ye are in
   heaviness through manifold temptations."
				</p><p>
   [6.] When the soul is at any time more or less overcome by temptations,
   Christ in his tenderness relieves it with mercy and pardon; so that his
   shall not sink utterly under their burden, <reference osisRef="1John.2.1-1John.2.2">1 John 2:1-2</reference>
				</p><p>
   By one, more, or all of these ways, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Jesus manifest his
   conjugal tenderness and compassion towards the saints, in and under
   their temptations.
				</p><p>
   2. Christ is compassionate towards them in their afflictions: "In all
   their affliction he is afflicted," <reference osisRef="Isa.63.9">Isaiah 63:9</reference>; yea, it seems that
   all our afflictions (at least those of one sort, -- namely, which
   consist in persecutions) are his in the first place, ours only by
   participation. <reference osisRef="Col.1.24">Colossians 1:24</reference>, We [293] "fill up the measure of the
   afflictions of Christ." Two things evidently manifest this
   compassionateness in Christ: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) His interceding with his Father for their relief, <reference osisRef="Zech.1.12">Zechariah 1:12</reference>
   Christ intercedes<note n="intercedeth">Auto-modernized</note> on our behalf, not only in respect of our sins, but
   also our sufferings; and when the work of our afflictions is
   accomplished, we shall have the relief [294] he intercedes for. The
   Father always hears him; and we have not a deliverance from trouble, a
   recovering of health, ease of pain, freedom from any evil that ever
   laid hold upon us, but it is given us on the intercession of Jesus
   Christ. Believers are unacquainted with their own condition, if they
   look upon their mercies as dispensed in a way of common providence. And
   this may, indeed, be a cause why we esteem them no more, are no more
   thankful for them, nor fruitful in the enjoyment of them:  we see not
   how, by what means, nor on what account, they are dispensed to us. The
   generation of the people of God in the world are at this day alive,
   undevoured, merely on the account of the intercession of the Lord
   Jesus. His compassionateness has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been the fountain of their
   deliverances. Hence oftentimes he rebukes their sufferings and
   afflictions, that they shall not act to the utmost upon them when they
   are under them. He is with them when they pass through fire and water,
   <reference osisRef="Isa.43.2-Isa.43.3">Isaiah 43:2-3</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) In that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> and will, in the winding up of the matter, so
   sorely revenge the quarrel of their sufferings upon their enemies. He
   avenges his elect that cry to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; yea, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it speedily. The
   controversy of Zion leads on the day of his vengeance, <reference osisRef="Isa.34.8">Isaiah 34:8</reference>
   He looks upon them sometimes in distress, and considers what is the
   state of the world in reference to them. <reference osisRef="Zech.1.11">Zechariah 1:11</reference>, "We have walked
   to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note> still,
   and is at rest," say his messengers to him, whom he sent to consider
   the world and its condition during the affliction of his people. This
   commonly is the condition of the world in such a season, "They are at
   rest and quiet, their hearts are abundantly satiated; [295] they drink
   wine in bowls, and send gifts to one another." Then Christ looks to see
   who will come in for their succour, <reference osisRef="Isa.59.16-Isa.59.17">Isaiah 59:16-17</reference>; and finding none
   engaging himself for their relief, by the destruction of their
   adversaries, himself undertakes it. Now, this vengeance he accomplishes
   two ways: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] Temporally, upon persons, kingdoms, nations, and countries; (a
   type of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> you have, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.1-Isa.63.6">Isaiah 63:1-6</reference>); as he did it upon the old
   Roman world, <reference osisRef="Rev.6.15-Rev.6.16">Revelation of John 6:15-16</reference> And this also he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> two ways: 
				</p><p>
   1st. By calling out here and there an eminent opposer, and making him
   an example to all the world. So he dealt with Pharaoh: "For this cause
   have I raised you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> up," <reference osisRef="Exod.9.16">Exodus 9:16</reference> So he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> to this day; he lays
   his hand upon eminent adversaries, -- fills one with fury, another with
   folly, blasts a third, and makes another wither, or destroys them
   utterly and terribly. As a provoked lion, he lies not down without his
   prey.
				</p><p>
   2dly. In general, in the vials of his wrath which he will in these
   latter days pour out upon the antichristian world, and all that partake
   with them in their thoughts of vengeance and persecution. He will
   miserably destroy them, and make such work with them in the issue, that
   whosoever hears, both his ears shall tingle.
				</p><p>
   [2.] In eternal vengeance will he plead with the adversaries of his
   beloved, <reference osisRef="Matt.25.41-Matt.25.46">Matthew 25:41-46</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Thess.1.6">2 Thessalonians 1:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Jude.1.15">Jude 15</reference> It is hence evident
   that Christ abounds in pity and compassion towards his beloved.
   Instances might be multiplied, but these things are obvious, and occur
   to the thoughts of all.
				</p><p>
   In answer to this, I place in the saints chastity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, in every
   state and condition. That this might be the state of the church of
   Corinth, the apostle made it his endeavour. <reference osisRef="2Cor.11.2-2Cor.11.3">2 Corinthians 11:2-3</reference>, "I have
   espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin
   to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
   through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
   simplicity that is in Christ." And so is it said of the followers of
   the Lamb, on mount Sion, <reference osisRef="Rev.14.4">Revelation of John 14:4</reference>, "These are they which were not
   defiled with women, for they are virgins." What defilement that was
   they were free from, shall be afterward declared.
				</p><p>
   Now, there are three things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this chastity consists: 
				</p><p>
   1. The not taking any thing into their affections and esteem for those
   ends and purposes for which they have received Jesus Christ. Here the
   Galatians failed in their conjugal affection to Christ; they preserved
   not themselves chaste to him. They had received Christ for life, and
   justification, and him only; but being after a while overcome with
   [296] charms, or bewitched, they took into the same place with him the
   righteousness of the law. How Paul deals with them hereupon is known.
   How sorely, how pathetically does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he admonish them, how severely
   reprove them, how clearly convince them of their madness and folly!
   This, then, is the first chaste affection believers bear in their heart
   to Christ:  having received him for their righteousness and salvation
   before God, for the fountain, spring, and well-head of all their
   supplies, they will not now receive any other thing into his room and
   in his stead. As to instance, in one particular:  We receive him for
   our [297] acceptance with God. All that here can stand in competition
   with him for our affections, must be our own endeavours for a [298]
   righteousness to commend us to God. Now, this must be either before we
   receive him, or after. [As] for all duties and endeavours, of what sort
   soever, for the pleasing of God before our receiving of Christ, you
   know what was the apostle's frame, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8-Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:8-10</reference> All endeavours, all
   advantages, all privileges, he rejects with indignation, as loss, --
   with abomination, as dung; and winds up all his aims and desires in
   Christ alone and his righteousness, for those ends and purposes. But
   the works we do after we have received Christ are of another
   consideration. Indeed, they are acceptable to God; it pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note> him that
   we should walk in them. But as to that end for which we receive Christ,
   they are of no other account than the former, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.8-Eph.2.10">Ephesians 2:8-10</reference> Even the
   works we do after believing, -- those which we are created to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in
   Christ Jesus, those that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordained that believers "should walk
   in them," -- as to justification and acceptance with God, (here called
   salvation), are excluded. It will one day appear that Christ abhors the
   janglings of men about the place of their own works and obedience, in
   the business of their acceptation with God; nor will the saints find
   any peace in adulterous thoughts of that kind. The chastity we owe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him requires another frame. The necessity, usefulness, and excellency
   of gospel obedience shall be afterward declared. It is marvellous to
   see how hard it is to keep some professors to any faithfulness with
   Christ in this thing; -- how many disputes have been managed, [299] how
   many distinctions invented, how many shifts and evasions studied, to
   keep up something, in some place or other, to some purpose or other,
   that they may dally withal. Those that love him indeed are otherwise
   minded.
				</p><p>
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, then, of all things, do the saints endeavour to keep their
   affections chaste and loyal to Jesus Christ. He is made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them of
   God "righteousness;" and they will own nothing else to that purpose:
   yea, sometimes they know not whether they have any interest in him or
   no, -- he absents and withdraws himself; they still continue solitary,
   in a state of widowhood, refusing to be comforted, though many things
   offer themselves to that purpose, because he is not. When Christ is at
   any time absent from the soul, when it cannot see that it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any
   interest in him, many lovers offer themselves to it, many woo its
   affections, to get it to rest on this or that thing for relief and
   succour; but though it go mourning never so long, it will have nothing
   but Christ to lean upon. Whenever the soul is in the wilderness, in the
   saddest condition, there it will stay until Christ come for to take it
   up, until it can come forth leaning upon him, <reference osisRef="Song.8.5">Song of Solomon 8:5</reference> The many
   instances of this that the book of Canticles affords us, we have in
   part spoken of before.
				</p><p>
   This does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> communion with Christ:  he watches<note n="watcheth">Auto-modernized</note> diligently
   over his own heart, that nothing creep into its affections, to give it
   any peace or establishment before God, but Christ only. Whenever that
   question is to be answered, "With which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> shall I come before the Lord,
   and appear before the high God?" he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not gather up, "This or that I
   will do;" or, "Here and there I will watch, and amend my ways;" but
   instantly he cries, "In the Lord Jesus have I [300] righteousness; all
   my desire is, to be found in him, not having on my own righteousness."
				</p><p>
   2. In cherishing that Spirit, that holy Comforter, which Christ sends
   to us, to abide with us in his room and stead. He tells us that he
   sends him to that purpose, <reference osisRef="John.16.7">John 16:7</reference> He gives him to us, "vicariam
   navare operam," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Tertullian, -- to abide with us for ever, for all
   those ends and purposes which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to fulfil toward us and upon us;
   he gives him to dwell in us, to keep us, and preserve us blameless for
   himself. His name is in him, and with him: and it is upon this account
   that whatever is done to any of Christ's is done to him, because it is
   done to them in whom he is and dwells by his Spirit. Now, in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> do the
   saints preserve their conjugal affections entire to Christ, that they
   labour by all means not to grieve his Holy Spirit, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent
   in his stead to abide with them. This the apostle puts them in mind of,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.4.30">Ephesians 4:30</reference>, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit."
				</p><p>
   There be two main ends for which Christ sends his Spirit to
   believers:  (1.) For their sanctification; (2.) For their consolation:
   to which two all the particular acts of purging, teaching, anointing,
   and the rest that are ascribed to him, may be referred. So there be two
   ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we may grieve him:  [1]. In respect of sanctification;
   [2.] In respect of consolation: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) In respect of sanctification. He is the Spirit of holiness, --
   holy in himself, and the author of holiness in us: he works it in us,
   <reference osisRef="Titus.3.5">Titus 3:5</reference>, and he persuades us to it, by those motions of his which
   are not to be [301] quenched. Now, this, in the first place, grieves
   the Spirit, when he is carrying on in us and for us a work so
   infinitely for our advantage, and without which we cannot see God, that
   we should run cross to him, in ways of unholiness, pollution, and
   defilement. So the connection of the words in the place before
   mentioned manifests, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.28-Eph.4.31">Ephesians 4:28-31</reference>; and thence does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> Paul bottom his
   powerful and most effectual persuasion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> holiness, even from the
   abode and indwelling of this Holy Spirit with us, <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.16-1Cor.3.17">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</reference>
   Indeed, what can grieve a loving and tender friend more than to oppose
   him and slight him when he is most intent about our good, -- and that a
   good of the greatest consequence to us. In this, then, believers make
   it their business to keep their hearts loyal and their affections
   chaste to Jesus Christ. They labour instantly not to grieve the Holy
   Spirit by loose and foolish, by careless and negligent walking, which
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent to dwell and abide with them. Therefore shall no anger,
   wrath, malice, envy, dwell in their hearts; because they are contrary
   to the holy, meek Spirit of Christ, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given to dwell with
   them. They attend to his motions, make use of his assistance, improve
   his gifts, and nothing lies more upon their spirits, than that they may
   walk worthy of the presence of this holy substitute of the Lord Jesus
   Christ.
				</p><p>
   (2.) As to consolation. This is the second great end for which Christ
   gives and sends his Spirit to us; who from thence, by the way of
   eminency, is called "The Comforter." To this end he seals us, anoints
   us, establishes us, and gives us peace and joy. Of all which I shall
   afterward speak at large. Now, there be two ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he may be
   grieved as to this end of his mission, and our chastity to Jesus Christ
   thereby violated: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] By placing our comforts and joys in other things, and not being
   filled with joy in the Holy Ghost. When we make creatures or creature
   comforts -- any thing whatever but what we receive by the Spirit of
   Christ -- to be our joy and our delight, we are false with Christ. So
   was it with Demas, [302] who loved the present world. When the ways of
   the Spirit of God are grievous and burdensome to us, -- when we say,
   "When will the Sabbath be past, that we may exact all our labours?" --
   when our delight and refreshment lies in earthly things, -- we are
   unsuitable to Christ. May not his Spirit say, "Why do I still abide
   with these poor souls? I provide them joys unspeakable and glorious;
   but they refuse them, for perishing things. I provide them spiritual,
   eternal, abiding consolations, and it is all rejected for a thing of
   nought." This Christ cannot bear; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, believers are exceeding
   careful in this, not to place their joy and consolation in any thing
   but what is administered by the Spirit. Their daily work is, to get
   their hearts crucified to the world and the things of it, and the world
   to their hearts; that they may not have living affections to dying
   things: they would fain look on the world as a crucified, dead thing,
   that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> neither form nor beauty; and if at any times they have been
   entangled with creatures and inferior contentment, and have lost their
   better joys, they cry out to Christ, "O restore to us the joys of your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   Spirit!"
				</p><p>
   [2.] He is grieved when, through darkness and unbelief, we will not, do
   not, receive those consolations which he tenders to us, and which he is
   abundantly willing that we should receive. But of this I shall have
   occasion to speak afterward, in handling our communion with the Holy
   Ghost.
				</p><p>
   3. In [keeping] his institutions, or matter and manner of his worship.
   Christ marrying his church to himself, taking it to that relation,
   still expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the main of their chaste and choice affections to him
   to lie in their keeping his institutions and his worship according to
   his appointment. The breach of this he calls "adultery" everywhere, and
   "whoredom." He is a "jealous God;" and he gives himself that title only
   in respect of his institutions. And the whole apostasy of the Christian
   church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> false worship is called [303] "fornication;" and the church
   that leads the others to false worship, the "mother of harlots." On
   this account, those believers who really attend to communion with Jesus
   Christ, do labour to keep their hearts chaste to him in his ordinances,
   institutions, and worship; and that two ways: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) They will receive nothing, practice nothing, own nothing his
   worship, but what is of his appointment. They know that from the
   foundation of the world he never did allow, nor ever will, that in any
   thing the will of the creatures should be the measure of his honour or
   the principle of his worship, either as to matter or manner. It was a
   witty and true sense that one gave of the second commandment: "Non
   imago, non simulachrum prohibetur; sed non facies tibi;" -- it is a
   making to ourselves, an inventing, a finding out, ways of worship, or
   means of honouring God, not by him appointed, that is so severely
   forbidden. Believers know what entertainment all will-worship finds
   with God: "Who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> required these things at your hand?" and, "In vain
   do you worship me, teaching for doctrines the traditions of men," -- is
   the best it meets with. I shall take leave to say what is upon my
   heart, and what (the Lord assisting) I shall willingly endeavour to
   make good against all the world, -- namely, that that principle, that
   the church has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> power to institute and appoint any thing or ceremony
   belonging to the worship of God, either as to matter or to manner,
   beyond the orderly observance of such circumstances as necessarily
   attend such ordinances as Christ himself has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> instituted, lies at the
   bottom of all the horrible superstition and idolatry, of all the
   confusion, blood, persecution, and wars, that have for so long a season
   spread themselves over the face of the Christian world; and that it is
   the design of a great part of the Revelation to make a discovery of
   this truth. And I doubt not but that the great controversy which God
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> had with this nation for so many years, and which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> pursued
   with so much anger and indignation, was upon this account:  that,
   contrary to that glorious light of the gospel which shone among us, the
   wills and fancies of men, under the name of order, decency, and the
   authority of the church (a chimera that none knew what it was, nor
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the power of it did consist, nor in whom reside), were imposed
   on men in the ways and worship of God. Neither was all that pretence of
   glory, beauty, comeliness, and conformity, that then was pleaded, any
   thing more or less than what God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so describe in the church of
   Israel, <reference osisRef="Ezek.16.25">Ezekiel 16:25</reference>, and forwards. Hence was the Spirit of God in
   prayer derided; hence was the powerful preaching of the gospel
   despised; hence was the Sabbath decried; hence was holiness stigmatised
   and persecuted; -- to what end? That Jesus Christ might be deposed from
   the sole privilege and power of law-making in his church; that the true
   husband might be thrust aside, and adulterers of his spouse embraced;
   that taskmasters might be appointed in and over his house, which he
   never gave to his church, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.11">Ephesians 4:11</reference>; that a ceremonious, pompous,
   outward show worship, drawn from Pagan, Judaical, and Antichristian
   observations, might be introduced; -- of all which there is not one
   word, tittle, or iota, in the whole book of God. This, then, they who
   hold communion with Christ are careful of:  they will admit of
   nothing, practice nothing, in the worship of God, private or public,
   but what they have his warrant for; unless it comes in his name, with
   "Thus says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Jesus," they will not hear "an angel from heaven."
   They know the apostles themselves were to teach the saints only what
   Christ commanded them, <reference osisRef="Matt.28.20">Matthew 28:20</reference> You know how many in this very
   nation, in the days not long since past, yea, how many thousands, left
   their native soil, and went into a vast and howling wilderness in the
   utmost parts of the world, to keep their souls undefiled and chaste to
   their dear Lord Jesus, as to this of his worship and institutions.
				</p><p>
   (2.) They readily embrace, receive, and practice every thing that the
   Lord Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed. They inquire diligently into his mind and
   will, that they may know it. They go to him for directions, and beg of
   him to lead them in the way they have not known. The 119th Psalm may be
   a pattern for this. How does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the good, holy soul breathe after
   instruction in the ways and ordinances, the statutes and judgments, of
   God! This, I say, they are tender in: whatever is of Christ, they
   willingly submit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, accept of, and give up themselves to the
   constant practice of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; whatever comes on any other account they
   refuse.
				</p><p>
   IV. Christ manifests and evidences his love to his saints in a way of
   bounty, -- in that rich, plentiful provision he makes for them. It has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   "pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell," <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference>;
   and that for this end, that "of his fulness we might all receive, and
   grace for grace," <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference> I shall not insist upon the particulars
   of that provision which Christ makes for his saints, with all those
   influences of the Spirit of life and grace that daily they receive from
   him, -- that bread that he gives them to the full, the refreshment they
   have from him; I shall only observe this, that the Scripture affirms
   him to do all things for them in an abundant manner, or to do it
   richly, in a way of bounty. Whatever he gives us, -- his grace to
   assist us, his presence to comfort us, -- he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it abundantly. You
   have the general assertion of it, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.20">Romans 5:20</reference>, "Where sin abounded,
   grace did much more abound." If grace abound much more in comparison of
   sin, it is abundant grace indeed; as will easily be granted by any that
   shall consider how sin has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> abounded, and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, in every soul. Hence he
   is said to be able, and we are bid to expect that he should do for us
   "exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think," <reference osisRef="Eph.3.20">Ephesians 3:20</reference> Is
   it pardoning mercy we receive of him? why, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> "abundantly pardon,"
   <reference osisRef="Isa.55.7">Isaiah 55:7</reference>; he will multiply or add to pardon, -- he will add pardon to
   pardon, that grace and mercy shall abound above all our sins and
   iniquities. Is it the Spirit he gives us? he sheds him upon us richly
   or "abundantly," <reference osisRef="Titus.3.6">Titus 3:6</reference>; not only bidding us drink of the water of
   life freely, but also bestowing him in such a plentiful measure, that
   rivers of water shall flow from them that receive him, <reference osisRef="John.7.38-John.7.39">John 7:38-39</reference>, -- that they shall never thirst any more when have drank of him. Is
   it grace that we receive of him? he gives that also in a way of bounty;
   we receive "abundance of grace," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.17">Romans 5:17</reference>; he "abounds toward us in
   all wisdom and prudence," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.8">Ephesians 1:8</reference> Hence is that invitation, <reference osisRef="Song.5.1">Song of Solomon 5:1</reference> If in any things, then, we are straitened, it is in ourselves;
   Christ deals bountifully with us. Indeed, the great sin of believers
   is, that they make not use of Christ's bounty as they ought to do; that
   we do not every day take of him mercy in abundance. The oil never
   ceases<note n="ceaseth">Auto-modernized</note> till the vessels cease; supplies from Christ fail not but only
   when our faith fails in receiving them.
				</p><p>
   Then our return to Christ is in a way of duty. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this two things are
   required: 
				</p><p>
   1. That we follow after and practise holiness in the power of it, as it
   is obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ. Under this formality, as obedience to
   him, all gospel obedience is called, "whatsoever Christ commands us,"
   <reference osisRef="Matt.28.20">Matthew 28:20</reference>; and says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, <reference osisRef="John.15.14">John 15:14</reference>, "Ye are my friends, if ye
   do whatsoever I command you;" and it is required of us that we live to
   him who died for us, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.15">2 Corinthians 5:15</reference>, -- live to him in all holy
   obedience, -- live to him as our Lord and King. Not that I suppose
   there are peculiar precepts and a peculiar law of Jesus Christ, in the
   observance of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are justified, as the Socinians fancy; for surely
   the gospel requires of us no more, but "to love the Lord our God with
   all our hearts, and all our souls," -- which the law also required; --
   but that, the Lord Jesus having brought us into a condition of
   acceptance with God, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our obedience is well-pleasing to him, and
   we being to honour him as we honour the Father, that we have a respect
   and peculiar regard to him in all our obedience. So <reference osisRef="Titus.2.14">Titus 2:14</reference>, he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> purchased us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself. And thus believers do in their
   obedience; they eye Jesus Christ, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) As the author of their faith and obedience, for whose sake it is
   "given to them to believe," <reference osisRef="Phil.1.29">Philippians 1:29</reference>; and who by his Spirit works
   that obedience in them. So the apostle, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.1-Heb.12.2">Hebrews 12:1-2</reference>; in the course
   of our obedience we still look to Jesus, "the author of our faith."
   Faith is here both the grace of faith, and the fruit of it in
   obedience.
				</p><p>
   (2.) As him in, for, and by whom we have acceptance with God in our
   obedience. They know all their duties are weak, imperfect, not able to
   abide the presence of God; and therefore they look to Christ as him who
   bears the iniquity of their holy things, who adds incense to their
   prayers, gathers out all the weeds of their duties, and makes them
   acceptable to God.
				</p><p>
   (3.) As one that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> renewed the commands of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, with
   mighty obligations to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience. So the apostle, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.14-2Cor.5.15">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</reference>,
   "The love of Christ constrains<note n="constraineth">Auto-modernized</note> us;" of which afterward.
				</p><p>
   (4.) They consider him as God, equal with his Father, to whom all
   honour and obedience is due. So <reference osisRef="Rev.5.13">Revelation of John 5:13</reference> But these things I have,
   not long since, opened [304] in another treatise, dealing about the
   worship of Christ as mediator. This, then, the saints do in all their
   obedience; they have a special regard to their dear Lord Jesus. He is,
   on all these accounts, and innumerable others, continually in their
   thoughts. His love to them, his life for them, his death for them, --
   all his kindness and mercy constrains them to live to him.
				</p><p>
   2. By labouring to abound in fruits of holiness. As he deals with us in
   a way of bounty, and deals out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us abundantly, so he requires that
   we abound in all grateful, obediential returns to him. So we are
   exhorted to "be always abounding in the work of the Lord," <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.58">1 Corinthians 15:58</reference> This is that I intend:  the saints are not satisfied with that
   measure that at any time they have attained, but are still pressing,
   that they may be more dutiful, more fruitful to Christ.
				</p><p>
   And this is a little glimpse of some of that communion which we enjoy
   with Christ. It is but a little, from him who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the least experience
   of it of all the saints of God; who yet has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> found that in it which is
   better than ten thousand worlds; who desires to spend the residue of
   the few and evil days of his pilgrimage in pursuit of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, -- in the
   contemplation of the excellencies, desirableness, love, and grace of
   our dear Lord Jesus, and in making returns of obedience according to
   his will: to whose soul, in the midst of the perplexities of this
   wretched world, and cursed rebellions of his own heart, this is the
   great relief, that "He that shall come will come, and will not tarry."
   "The Spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him that reads<note n="readeth">Auto-modernized</note> say,
   Come. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."

<p>
   Of communion with Christ in purchased grace -- Purchased grace
   considered in respect of its rise and fountain -- The first rise of it,
   in the obedience of Christ -- Obedience properly ascribed to Christ --
   Two ways considered: what it was, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it did consist -- Of his
   obedience to the law in general -- Of the law of the Mediator -- His
   habitual righteousness, how necessary; as also his obedience to the law
   of the Mediator -- Of his actual obedience or active righteousness --
   All Christ's obedience performed as he was Mediator -- His active
   obedience for us -- This proved at large, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4-Gal.4.5">Galatians 4:4-5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.5.19">Romans 5:19</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:10</reference>; <reference osisRef="Zech.3.3-Zech.3.5">Zechariah 3:3-5</reference> -- One objection removed --
   Considerations of Christ's active righteousness closed -- Of the death
   of Christ, and its influence into our acceptation with God -- A price;
   redemption, what it is -- A sacrifice; atonement made thereby -- A
   punishment; satisfaction thereby -- The intercession of Christ; with
   its influence into our acceptation with God.
				</p><p>
   Our process [305] is now to communion with Christ in purchased grace,
   as it was before proposed: "That we may know him, and the power of his
   resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, and be made
   conformable to his death," <reference osisRef="Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   By purchased grace, I understand all that righteousness and grace which
   Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> procured, or wrought out for us, or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> by any means make
   us partakers of, or bestows on us for our benefit, by any thing that he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done or suffered, or by any thing he continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> to do as
   mediator:  First, What this purchased grace is, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   consist; Secondly, How we hold communion with Christ in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; are the
   things that now come under consideration.
				</p><p>
   The First may be considered two ways:  1. In respect of the rise and
   fountain of it; 2. Of its nature, or in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   1. It has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a threefold rise, spring, or causality in Christ:  (1.) The
   obedience of his life. (2.) The suffering of his death. (3.) His
   continued intercession. All the actions of Christ as mediator, leading
   to the communication of grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, may be either referred to these
   heads, or to some things that are subservient to them or consequents of
   them.
				</p><p>
   2. For the nature of this grace in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion with Christ,
   flowing from these heads and fountains, it may be referred to these
   three:  (1.) Grace of justification, or acceptation with God; which
   makes a relative change in us, as to state and condition. (2.) Grace of
   sanctification, or holiness before God; which makes a real change in
   us, as to principle and operation. (3.) Grace of privilege; which is
   mixed, as we shall show, if I go forth to the handling of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Now, that we have communion with Christ in this purchased grace, is
   evident on this single consideration, -- that there is almost nothing
   that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done, which is a spring of that grace of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we
   speak, but we are said to do it with him. We are "crucified" with him,
   <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference>; we are "dead" with him, <reference osisRef="2Tim.2.11">2 Timothy 2:11</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.3.3">Colossians 3:3</reference>; and
   "buried" with him, <reference osisRef="Rom.6.4">Romans 6:4</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.2.12">Colossians 2:12</reference>; we are "quickened together
   with him," <reference osisRef="Col.2.13">Colossians 2:13</reference>; "risen" with him, <reference osisRef="Col.3.1">Colossians 3:1</reference> "He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   quickened us together with Christ, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> raised us up together, and
   made us sit together in heavenly places," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.5-Eph.2.6">Ephesians 2:5-6</reference> In the actings
   of Christ, there is, by virtue of the compact between him as mediator,
   and the Father, such an assured foundation laid of the communication of
   the fruits of those actings to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those in whose stead he performed
   them, that they are said, in the participation of those fruits, to have
   done the same things with him. The life and power of which truth we may
   have occasion hereafter to inquire into: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) The first fountain and spring of this grace, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have our
   communion with Christ, is first to be considered; and that is the
   obedience of his life: concerning which it must be declared, -- [1.]
   What it is that is intended thereby, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note>. [2.]
   What influence it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> into the grace of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak.
				</p><p>
   To the handling of this I shall only premise this observation, --
   namely, that in the order of procurement, the life of Christ (as was
   necessary) precedes<note n="precedeth">Auto-modernized</note> his death; and therefore we shall handle it in the
   first place: but in the order of application, the benefits of his death
   are bestowed on us antecedently, in the nature of the things
   themselves, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those of his life; as will appear, and that
   necessarily, from the state and condition in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we are.
				</p><p>
   [1.] By the obedience of the life of Christ, I intend the universal
   conformity of the Lord Jesus Christ, as he was or is, in his being
   mediator, to the whole will of God; and his complete actual fulfilling
   of the whole of every law of God, or doing of all that God in them
   required. He might have been perfectly holy by obedience to the law of
   creation, the moral law, as the angels were; neither could any more, as
   a man walking with God, be required of him: but he submitted himself
   also to every law or ordinance that was introduced upon the occasion of
   sin, which, on his own account, he could not be subject to, it becoming
   him to "fulfil [306] all righteousness," <reference osisRef="Matt.3.15">Matthew 3:15</reference>, as he spake in
   reference to a newly-instituted ceremony.
				</p><p>
   That obedience is properly ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ as mediator, the
   Scripture is witness, both as to name and thing <reference osisRef="Heb.5.8">Hebrews 5:8</reference>, "Though he
   were a Son, yet learned he obedience," etc.; yea, he was obedient in
   his sufferings, and it was that which gave life to his death, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:8</reference> He was obedient to death: for in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> "he did make his soul an
   offering for sin," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.10">Isaiah 53:10</reference>; or, "his soul made an offering for
   sin," as it is interpreted, verse 12, "he poured out his soul to
   death," or, "his soul poured out itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death." And he not only
   sanctified himself to be an offering, <reference osisRef="John.17.19">John 17:19</reference>, but he also
   "offered up himself," <reference osisRef="Heb.9.14">Hebrews 9:14</reference>, an "offering of a sweet savour to
   God," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.2">Ephesians 5:2</reference> Hence, as to the whole of his work, he is called the
   Father's "servant," <reference osisRef="Isa.42.1">Isaiah 42:1</reference>, and verse 19: and he professes of
   himself that he "came into the world to do the will of God, the will of
   him that sent him;" for which he manifests "his great readiness," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.7">Hebrews 10:7</reference>; -- all which evince his obedience. But I suppose I need not
   insist on the proof of this, that Christ, in the work of mediation, and
   as mediator, was obedient, and did what he did willingly and
   cheerfully, in obedience to God.
				</p><p>
   Now, this obedience of Christ may be considered two ways:  1st. As to
   the habitual root and fountain of it. 2dly. As to the actual parts or
   duties of it: 
				</p><p>
   1st. The habitual righteousness of Christ as mediator in his human
   nature, was the absolute, complete, exact conformity of the soul of
   Christ to the will, mind, or law of God; or his perfect habitually
   inherent righteousness. This he had necessarily from the grace of
   union; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it is that that which was born of the virgin was a
   "holy thing," <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference> It was, I say, necessary consequentially,
   that it should be so; though the effecting of it were by the free
   operations of the Spirit, <reference osisRef="Luke.2.52">Luke 2:52</reference> He had an all-fulness of grace
   on all accounts. This the apostle describes, <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26">Hebrews 7:26</reference>, "Such an
   high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
   sinners." Every way separate and distant from sin and sinners he was to
   be; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is called "The Lamb of God, without spot or blemish," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.19">1 Peter 1:19</reference> This habitual holiness of Christ was inconceivably above
   that of the angels. He who " [307] charges<note n="chargeth">Auto-modernized</note> his angels with folly," <reference osisRef="Job.4.18">Job 4:18</reference>; "who puts<note n="putteth">Auto-modernized</note> no trust in his saints; and in whose sight the
   heavens" (or their inhabitants) "are not clean," chap. xv. 15; always
   embraces<note n="embraceth">Auto-modernized</note> him in his bosom, and is always well pleased with him, <reference osisRef="Matt.3.17">Matthew 3:17</reference> And the reason of this is, because every other creature,
   though never so holy, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the Spirit of God by measure; but he was not
   given to Christ "by measure," <reference osisRef="John.3.34">John 3:34</reference>; and that because it pleased
   him that in him "should all fulness dwell," <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference> This habitual
   grace of Christ, though not absolutely infinite, yet, in respect of any
   other creature, it is as the water of the sea to the water of a pond or
   pool. All other creatures are depressed from perfection by this, --
   that they subsist in a created, dependent being; and so have the
   fountain of what is communicated to them without them. But the human
   nature of Christ subsists in the person of the Son of God; and so has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   the bottom and fountain of its holiness in the strictest unity with
   itself.
				</p><p>
   2dly. The actual obedience of Christ, as was said, was his willing,
   cheerful, obediential performance of every thing, duty, or command,
   that God, by virtue of any law whereto we were subject and obnoxious,
   did require; and [his obedience], moreover, to the peculiar law of the
   mediator. Of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, then, are two parts: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) That whatever was required of us by virtue of any law, -- that
   he did and fulfilled. Whatever was required of us by the law of nature,
   in our state of innocence; whatever kind of duty was added by morally
   positive or ceremonial institutions; whatever is required of us in way
   of obedience to righteous judicial laws, -- he did it all. Hence he is
   said to be "made under the law," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference>; subject or obnoxious to
   it, to all the precepts or commands of it. So, <reference osisRef="Matt.3.15">Matthew 3:15</reference>, he said
   it became him to [308] "fulfil all righteousness," -- pasan
   dikaiosunen, -- all manner of righteousness whatever; that is,
   everything that God required, as is evident from the application of
   that general axiom to the baptism of John. I shall not need, for this,
   to go to particular instances, in the duties of the law of nature, --
   to God and his parents; of morally positive [duties], in the Sabbath,
   and other acts of worship; of the ceremonial law, in circumcision, and
   observation of all the rites of the Judaical church; of the judicial,
   in paying tribute to governors; -- it will suffice, I presume, that on
   the one hand he "did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth;" and
   on the other, that he "fulfilled all righteousness:" and thereupon the
   Father was always well pleased with him. This was that which he owned
   of himself, that he came to do the will of God; and he did it.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) There was a peculiar law of the mediator, which respected
   himself merely, and contained all those acts and duties of his which
   are not for our imitation. So that obedience which he showed in dying
   was peculiarly to this [309] law, <reference osisRef="John.10.18">John 10:18</reference>, "I have power to lay down
   my life: this commandment have I received of my Father." As mediator,
   he received this peculiar command of his Father, that he should lay
   down his life, and take it again; and he was obedient to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Hence
   we say, he who is mediator did some things merely as a man, subject to
   the law of God in general; so he prayed for his persecutors, -- those
   that put him to death, <reference osisRef="Luke.23.34">Luke 23:34</reference>; -- some things as mediator; so
   he prayed for his elect only, <reference osisRef="John.17.9">John 17:9</reference> There were not worse in the
   world, really and evidently, than many of them that crucified him; yet,
   as a man, subject to the law, he forgave them, and prayed for them.
   When he prayed as mediator, his Father always heard him and answered
   him, <reference osisRef="John.11.41">John 11:41</reference>; and in the other prayers he was accepted as one
   exactly performing his duty.
				</p><p>
   This, then, is the obedience of Christ; which was the first thing
   proposed to be considered. The next is, --
				</p><p>
   [2.] That it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> an influence into the grace of which we speak,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we hold communion with him, -- namely, our free acceptation
   with God; what that influence is, must also follow in its order.
				</p><p>
   1st. For his habitual righteousness, I shall only propose it under
   these two considerations: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) That upon this supposition, that it was needful that we should
   have a mediator that was God and man in one person, as it could not
   otherwise be, so it must needs be that he must be holy. For although
   there be but one primary necessary effect of the hypostatical union
   (which is the subsistence of the human nature in the person of the Son
   of God), yet that he that was so united to him should be a "holy
   thing," completely holy, was necessary also, -- of which before.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) That the relation which this righteousness of Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to
   the grace we receive from him is only this, -- that thereby he was
   hikanos -- fit to do all that he had to do for us. This is the
   intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of the apostle, <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26">Hebrews 7:26</reference> Such a one "became us;" it was
   needful he should be such a one, that he might do what he had to do.
   And the reasons of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> are two: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] Had he not been completely furnished with habitual grace, he
   could never have actually fulfilled the righteousness which was
   required at his hands. It was in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> that he was able to do all that
   he did. So himself lays down the presence of the Spirit with him as the
   bottom and foundation of his going forth to his work, <reference osisRef="Isa.61.1">Isaiah 61:1</reference>
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] He could not have been a complete and perfect sacrifice, nor
   have answered all the types and figures of him, that were [310]
   complete and without blemish. But now, Christ having this habitual
   righteousness, if he had never yielded any continued obedience to the
   law actively, but had suffered as soon after his incarnation as Adam
   sinned after his creation, he had been a fit sacrifice and offering;
   and therefore, doubtless, his following obedience has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> another use
   besides to fit him for an oblation, for which he was most fit without
   it.
				</p><p>
   2dly. For Christ's obedience to the law of mediation, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is not
   coincident with his passive obedience, as they speak (for I know that
   expression is improper); it was that which was requisite for the
   discharging of his office, and is not imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as though we had
   done it, though the apotelesmata and fruits of it are; but is of the
   nature of his intercession, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he provides the good things we
   stand in need of, at least subserviently to his oblation and
   intercession; -- of which more afterward.
				</p><p>
   3dly. About his actual fulfilling of the law, or doing all things that
   of us are required, there is some doubt and question; and about it
   there are three several opinions: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) That this active obedience of Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no farther influence
   into our justification and acceptation with God, but as it was
   preparatory to his blood-shedding and oblation; which is the sole cause
   of our justification, the whole righteousness which is imputed to us
   arising from thence.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) That it may be considered two ways:  [1st.] As it is purely
   obedience; and so it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no other state but that before mentioned.
   [2dly.] As it was accomplished with suffering, and joined with it, as
   it was part of his humiliation, so it is imputed to us, or is part of
   that upon the account of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are justified.
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) That this obedience of Christ, being done for us, is reckoned
   graciously of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; and upon the account of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> are we accepted
   as righteous before him. My intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> is not to handle this difference
   in the way of a controversy, but to give such an understanding of the
   whole as may speedily be reduced to the practice of godliness and
   consolation; and this I shall do in the ensuing observations: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] That the obedience that Christ yielded to the law in general, is
   not only to the peculiar law of the mediator, though he yielded it as
   mediator. He was incarnate as mediator, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference>; and
   all he afterward did, it was as our mediator. For that cause "came he
   into the world," and did and suffered whatever he did or suffered in
   this world. So that of this expression, as mediator, there is a twofold
   sense: for it may be taken strictly, as relating solely to the law of
   the mediator, and so Christ may be said to do as mediator only what he
   did in obedience to that law; but in the sense now insisted on,
   whatever Christ did as a man subject to any law, he did it as mediator,
   because he did it as part of the duty incumbent on him who undertook so
   to be.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] That whatever Christ did as mediator, he did it for them whose
   mediator he was, or in whose stead and for whose good he executed the
   office of a mediator before God. This the Holy Ghost witnesses<note n="witnesseth">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.3-Rom.8.4">Romans 8:3-4</reference>, "What the law could not do, in that it was wreak through
   the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
   for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law
   might be fulfilled in us;" because that we could not in that condition
   of weakness into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> we are cast by sin, come to God, and be freed
   from condemnation by the law, God sent Christ as a mediator, to do and
   suffer whatever the law required at our hands for that end and purpose,
   that we might not be condemned, but accepted of God. It was all to this
   end, -- "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us;"
   that is, which the law required of us, consisting in duties of
   obedience. This Christ performed for us. This expression of the
   apostle, "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
   for sin, condemned sin in the flesh;" if you will add to it, that of
   <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference>, that he was so sent forth as that he was hupo nomon
   genomenos, "made under the law," (that is, obnoxious to it, to yield
   all the obedience that it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> require), comprises the whole of what
   Christ did or suffered; and all this, the Holy Ghost tells us, was for
   us, verse 4.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] That the end of this active obedience of Christ cannot be
   assigned to be, that he might be fitted for his death and oblation. For
   he answered all types, and was every way hikanos (fit to be made an
   offering for sin), by his union and habitual grace. So that if the
   obedience Christ performed be not reckoned to us, and done upon our
   account, there is no just cause to be assigned why he should live here
   in the world so long as he did, in perfect obedience to all the laws of
   God. Had he died before, there had been perfect innocence, and perfect
   holiness, by his habitual grace, and infinite virtue and worth from the
   dignity of his person; and surely he yielded not that long course of
   all manner of obedience, but for some great and special purpose in
   reference to our salvation.
				</p><p>
   [4thly.] That had not the obedience of Christ been for us (in what
   sense we shall see instantly), it might in his life have been required
   of him to yield obedience to the law of nature, the alone law which he
   could be liable to as a man; for an innocent man in a covenant of
   works, as he was, needs no other law, nor did God ever give any other
   law to any such person (the law of creation is all that an innocent
   creature is liable to, with what symbols of that law God is pleased to
   add). And yet to this law also was his subjection voluntary; and that
   not only consequentially, because he was born upon his own choice, not
   by any natural course, but also because as mediator, God and man, he
   was not by the institution of that law obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it; being, as it
   were, exempted and lifted above that law by the hypostatical union:
   yet, when I say his subjection to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> was voluntary, I do not intend
   that it was merely arbitrary and at choice whether he would yield
   obedience [311] to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it or no, -- but on supposition of his undertaking
   to be a mediator, it was necessary it should be so, -- but that he
   voluntarily and willingly submitted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and so became really subject
   to the commands of it. But now, moreover, Jesus Christ yielded perfect
   obedience to all those laws which came upon us by the occasion of sin,
   as the ceremonial law; yea, those very institutions that signified the
   washing away of sin, and repentance from sin, as the baptism of John,
   which he had no need of himself. This, therefore, must needs be for us.
				</p><p>
   [5thly.] That the obedience of Christ cannot be reckoned amongst his
   sufferings, but is clearly distinct from it, as to all formalities.
   Doing is one thing, suffering another; they are in diverse
   predicaments, and cannot be coincident.
				</p><p>
   See, then, briefly what we have obtained by those considerations; and
   then I shall intimate what is the stream issuing from this first spring
   or fountain of purchased grace, with what influence it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   into that<note n="thereinto">Auto-modernized</note>: 
				</p><p>
   First, By the obedience of the life of Christ you see what is intended,
   -- his willing submission to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and perfect, complete fulfilling of,
   every law of God, that any of the saints of God were obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. It
   is true, every act almost of Christ's obedience, from the blood of his
   circumcision to the blood of his cross, was attended with suffering, so
   that his whole life might, in that regard, be called a death; but yet,
   looking upon his willingness and obedience in it, it is distinguished
   from his sufferings peculiarly so called, and termed his [312] active
   righteousness. This is, then, I say, as was showed, that complete,
   absolutely perfect accomplishment of the whole law of God by Christ,
   our mediator; through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he not only "did no sin, neither was there guile
   found in his mouth," but also most perfectly fulfilled all
   righteousness, as he affirmed it became him to do.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, That this obedience was performed by Christ not for himself,
   but for us, and in our stead. It is true, it must needs be, that while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note>
   he had his conversation in the flesh he must be most perfectly and
   absolutely holy; but yet the prime intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of his accomplishing of
   holiness, -- which consists in the complete obedience of his whole life
   to any law of God, -- that was no less for us than his suffering death.
   That this is so, the apostle tells us, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4-Gal.4.5">Galatians 4:4-5</reference>, "God sent forth
   his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
   under the law." This Scripture, formerly named, must be a little
   farther insisted on. He was both made of a woman, and made under the
   law; that is, obedient to it for us. The end here, both of the
   incarnation and obedience of Christ to the law (for that must needs be
   understood here by the phrase hupo nomon genomenos, -- that is,
   disposed of in such a condition as that he must yield subjection and
   obedience to the law), was all to redeem us. In these two expressions,
   "Made of a woman, made under the law," the apostle does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not knit his
   incarnation and death together, with an exclusion of the obedience of
   his life. And he was so made under the law, as those were under the law
   whom he was to redeem. Now, we were under the law, not only as
   obnoxious to its penalties, but as bound to all the duties of it. That
   this is our being "under the law," the apostle informs us, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.21">Galatians 4:21</reference>,
   "Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law." It was not the penalty
   of the law they desired to be under, but to be under it in respect of
   obedience. Take away, then, the end, and you destroy the means. If
   Christ were not incarnate nor made under the law for himself, he did
   not yield obedience for himself; it was all for us, for our good. Let
   us now look forward, and see what influence this has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> into our
   acceptation.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly, Then, I say, this perfect, complete obedience of Christ to the
   law is reckoned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. As there is a truth in that, "The day you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note>
   eatest you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt die," -- death is the reward of sin, and so we cannot
   be freed from death but by the death of Christ, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14-Heb.2.15">Hebrews 2:14-15</reference>; so
   also is that no less true, "Do this, and live," -- that life is not to
   he obtained unless all be done that the law requires. That is still
   true, "If you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> will<note n="wilt">Auto-modernized</note> enter into life, keep the commandments," <reference osisRef="Matt.19.17">Matthew 19:17</reference> They must, then, be kept by us, or our surety. Neither is it of any
   value which by some is objected, that if Christ yielded perfect
   obedience to the law for us, then are we no more bound to yield
   obedience; for by his undergoing death, the penalty of the law, we are
   freed from it. I answer, How did Christ undergo death? Merely as it was
   penal. How, then, are we delivered from death? Merely as it is penal.
   Yet we must die still; yea, as the last conflict with the effects of
   sin, as a passage to our Father, we must die. Well, then, Christ
   yielded perfect obedience to the law; but how did he do it? Purely as
   it stood in that conditional [arrangement], "Do this, and live." He did
   it in the strength of the grace he had received; he did it as a means
   of life, to procure life by it, as the tenor of a covenant. Are we,
   then, freed from this obedience? Yes; but how far? From doing it in our
   own strength; from doing it for this end, that we may obtain life
   everlasting. It is vain that some say confidently, that we must yet
   work for life; it is all one as to say we are yet under the old
   covenant, "Hoc fac, et vives:" we are not freed from obedience, as a
   way of walking with God, but we are, as a way of working to come to
   him: of which at large afterward.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.18-Rom.5.19">Romans 5:18-19</reference>, "By the righteousness of one the free gift came upon
   all men to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> justification of life: by the obedience of one shall many
   be made righteous," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Ghost. By his obedience to the law
   are we made righteous; it is reckoned to us for righteousness. That the
   passive obedience of Christ is here only intended is false: 
				</p><p>
   First, It is opposed to the disobedience of Adam, which was active. The
   dikaioma is opposed paraptomati, -- the righteousness to the fault. The
   fault was an active transgression of the law, and the obedience opposed
   to it must be an active accomplishment of it. Besides, obedience placed
   singly, in its own nature, denotes an action or actions conformable to
   the law; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> came Christ, not to destroy but to fulfil the law,
   <reference osisRef="Matt.5.17">Matthew 5:17</reference>, -- that was the design of his coming, and so for us; he
   came to fulfil the law for us, <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>, and [was] born to us, <reference osisRef="Luke.2.11">Luke 2:11</reference> This also was in that will of the Father which, out of his
   infinite love, he came to accomplish. Secondly, It cannot clearly be
   evinced that there is any such thing, in propriety of speech, as
   passive obedience; obeying is doing, to which passion or suffering
   cannot belong: I know it is commonly called so, when men obey until
   they suffer; but properly it is not so.
				</p><p>
   So also, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.9">Philippians 3:9</reference>, "And be found in him, not having my own
   righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith
   of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith." The
   righteousness we receive is opposed to our own obedience to the law;
   opposed to it, not as something in another kind, but as something in
   the same kind excluding that from such an end which the other obtains.
   Now this is the obedience of Christ to the law, -- himself thereby
   being "made to us righteousness," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference>
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.10">Romans 5:10</reference>, the issue of the death of Christ is placed upon
   reconciliation; that is, a slaying of the enmity and restoring us into
   that condition of peace and friendship in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Adam was before his
   fall. But is there no more to be done? Notwithstanding that there was
   no wrath due to Adam, yet he was to obey, if he would enjoy eternal
   life. Something there is, moreover, to be done in respect of us, if,
   after the slaying of the enmity and reconciliation made, we shall enjoy
   life: "Being reconciled by his death," we are saved by that perfect
   obedience which in his life he yielded to the law of God. There is
   distinct mention made of reconciliation, through a non-imputation of
   sin, as <reference osisRef="Ps.32.1">Psalms 32:1</reference>, <reference osisRef="Luke.1.77">Luke 1:77</reference>, <reference osisRef="Rom.3.2 Rom.3.25">Romans 3:2, 25</reference> Cor. v. 19; and
   justification through an imputation of righteousness, <reference osisRef="Jer.23.6">Jeremiah 23:6</reference>,
   <reference osisRef="Rom.4.1 Rom.4.5">Romans 4:1, 5</reference> Cor. i. 30; -- although these things are so far from
   being separated, that they are reciprocally affirmed of one another:
   which, as it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not evince an identity, so it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> an eminent
   union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>. And this last we have by the life of Christ.
				</p><p>
   This is fully expressed in that typical representation of our
   justification before the Lord, <reference osisRef="Zech.3.3-Zech.3.5">Zechariah 3:3-5</reference> Two things are there
   expressed to belong to our free acceptation before God:  1. The taking
   away of the guilt of our sin, our filthy robes; this is done by the
   death of Christ. Remission of sin is the proper fruit of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; but
   there is more also required, even a collation of righteousness, and
   thereby a right to life eternal. This is here called "Change of
   raiment;" so the Holy Ghost expresses it again, <reference osisRef="Isa.61.10">Isaiah 61:10</reference>, where he
   calls it plainly "The garments of salvation," and "The robe of
   righteousness." Now this is only made ours by the obedience of Christ,
   as the other by his death.
				</p><p>
   Objection. "But if this be so, then are we as righteous as Christ
   himself, being righteous with his righteousness."
				</p><p>
   Answer. But first, here is a great difference, -- if it were no more
   than that this righteousness was inherent in Christ, and properly his
   own, it is only reckoned or imputed to us, or freely bestowed on us,
   and we are made righteous with that which is not ours. But, secondly,
   the truth is, that Christ was not righteous with that righteousness for
   himself, but for us; so that here can be no comparison: only this we
   may say, we are righteous with his righteousness which he wrought for
   us, and that completely.
				</p><p>
   And this, now, is the rise of the purchased grace of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak, the
   obedience of Christ; and this is the influence of it into our
   acceptation with God. Whereas the guilt of sin, and our obnoxiousness
   to punishment on that account, is removed and taken away (as shall
   farther be declared) by the death of Christ; and whereas, besides the
   taking away of sin, we have need of a complete righteousness, upon the
   account of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we may be accepted with God; this obedience of Christ,
   through the free grace of God, is imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us for that end and
   purpose.
				</p><p>
   This is all I shall for the present insist on to this purpose. That the
   passive righteousness of Christ only is imputed to us in the
   non-imputation of sin, and that on the condition of our faith and new
   obedience, so exalting them into the room of the righteousness of
   Christ, is a thing which, in communion with the Lord Jesus, I have as
   yet no acquaintance withal. What may be said in the way of argument on
   the one side or other must be elsewhere considered.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The second spring of our communion with Christ in purchased grace,
   is his death and oblation. He lived for us, he died for us; he was ours
   in all he did, in all he suffered. [313] I shall be the more brief in
   handling of this, because on another design I have [314] elsewhere at
   large treated of all the concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of it.
				</p><p>
   Now, the death of Christ, as it is a spring of that purchased grace
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion with him, is in the Scripture proposed under
   a threefold consideration:  [1.] Of a price. [2.] Of a sacrifice. [3.]
   Of a penalty.
				</p><p>
   In the first regard, its proper effect is redemption; in the second,
   reconciliation or atonement; in the third, satisfaction; which are the
   great ingredients of that purchased grace through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>, in the first place,
   we have communion with Christ.
				</p><p>
   [1.] It is a price. "We are bought with a price," <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.20">1 Corinthians 6:20</reference>; being
   "not redeemed with silver and gold, and corruptible things, but with
   the precious blood of Christ," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.18-1Pet.1.19">1 Peter 1:18-19</reference>: which in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> answers
   those things in other contracts. [315] He came to "give his life a
   ransom for many," <reference osisRef="Matt.20.28">Matthew 20:28</reference>, -- a price of redemption, <reference osisRef="1Tim.2.6">1 Timothy 2:6</reference>
   The proper use and energy of this expression in the Scripture, I have
   elsewhere declared.
				</p><p>
   Now, the proper effect and issue of the death of Christ as a price or
   ransom is, as I said, redemption. Now, redemption is the deliverance of
   any one from bondage or captivity, and the miseries attending that
   condition, by the intervention or interposition of a price or ransom,
   paid by the redeemer to him by whose authority the captive was
   detained: 
				</p><p>
   1st. In general, it is a deliverance. Hence Christ is called "The
   Deliverer," <reference osisRef="Rom.11.26">Romans 11:26</reference>; giving himself to "deliver us," <reference osisRef="Gal.1.4">Galatians 1:4</reference> He
   is "Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come," <reference osisRef="1Thess.1.10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   2dly. It is the delivery of one from bondage or captivity. We are,
   without him, all prisoners and captives, "bound in prison," <reference osisRef="Isa.61.1">Isaiah 61:1</reference>; "sitting in darkness, in the prison house," <reference osisRef="Isa.42.7">Isaiah 42:7</reference>, xlix. 9;
   "prisoners in the pit in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there is no water," <reference osisRef="Zech.9.11">Zechariah 9:11</reference>; "the
   captives of the mighty, and the prey of the terrible," <reference osisRef="Isa.49.25">Isaiah 49:25</reference>;
   under a "captivity that must be led captive," <reference osisRef="Ps.68.18">Psalms 68:18</reference>: this puts
   us in "bondage," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.15">Hebrews 2:15</reference>
				</p><p>
   3dly. The person committing thus to prison and into bondage, is God
   himself. To him we owe "our debts," <reference osisRef="Matt.6.12">Matthew 6:12</reference>, xviii. 23-27; against
   him are our offences, <reference osisRef="Ps.51.4">Psalms 51:4</reference>; he is the judge and lawgiver, <reference osisRef="Jas.4.12">James 4:12</reference> To sin is to rebel against him. He shuts up men under
   disobedience, <reference osisRef="Rom.11.32">Romans 11:32</reference>; and he shall cast both body and soul of the
   impenitent into hell-fire, <reference osisRef="Matt.10.28">Matthew 10:28</reference> To his wrath are men obnoxious,
   <reference osisRef="John.3.36">John 3:36</reference>; and lie under it by the sentence of the law, which is
   their prison.
				</p><p>
   4thly. The miseries that attend this condition are innumerable. Bondage
   to Satan, sin, and the world, comprises the sum of them; from all which
   we are delivered by the death of Christ, as a price or ransom. "God
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> delivered us from the power of darkness, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> translated us
   into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through
   his blood," <reference osisRef="Col.1.13-Col.1.14">Colossians 1:13-14</reference> And he "redeems us from all iniquity," <reference osisRef="Titus.2.14">Titus 2:14</reference>; "from our vain conversation," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.18-1Pet.1.19">1 Peter 1:18-19</reference>; even from the
   guilt and power of our sin; purchasing us to himself "a peculiar
   people, zealous of good works," <reference osisRef="Titus.2.14">Titus 2:14</reference>: so dying for the
   "redemption of transgressions," <reference osisRef="Heb.9.15">Hebrews 9:15</reference>; redeeming us also from the
   world, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.5">Galatians 4:5</reference>
				</p><p>
   5thly. And all this is by the payment of the price mentioned into the
   hand of God, by whose supreme authority we are detained captives, under
   the sentence of the law. The debt is due to the great householder,
   <reference osisRef="Matt.18.23-Matt.18.24">Matthew 18:23-24</reference>; and the penalty, his curse and wrath: from which
   by it we are delivered, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5">Revelation of John 1:5</reference>
				</p><p>
   This the Holy Ghost frequently insists on. <reference osisRef="Rom.3.24-Rom.3.25">Romans 3:24-25</reference>, "Being
   justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ
   Jesus; whom God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
   his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins:" so
   also, <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.20">1 Corinthians 6:20</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.18">1 Peter 1:18</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.20.28">Matthew 20:28</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Tim.2.6">1 Timothy 2:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.7">Ephesians 1:7</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.1.13">Colossians 1:13</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference> And this is the first consideration of the
   death of Christ, as it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> an influence into the procurement of that
   grace in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we hold communion with him.
				</p><p>
   [2.] It was a sacrifice also. He had a body prepared him, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.5">Hebrews 10:5</reference>;
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was to accomplish what by the typical oblations and
   burnt-offerings of the law was prefigured. And that body he offered,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.10.10">Hebrews 10:10</reference>; -- that is, his whole human nature; for "his soul" also was
   made "an offering for sin," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.10">Isaiah 53:10</reference>: on which account he is said
   to offer himself, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.2">Ephesians 5:2</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>, ix. 26. He gave himself a
   sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savour; and this he did willingly,
   [316] as became him who was to be a sacrifice, -- the law of this
   obedience being written in his heart, <reference osisRef="Ps.40.8">Psalms 40:8</reference>; that is, he had a
   readiness, willingness, desire for its performance.
				</p><p>
   Now, the end of sacrifices, such as his was, bloody and for sin, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.10">Romans 5:10</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.2.17">Hebrews 2:17</reference>, was atonement and reconciliation. This is
   everywhere ascribed to them, that they were to make atonement; that is,
   in a way suitable to their nature. And this is the tendency of the
   death of Christ, as a sacrifice, atonement, and reconciliation with
   God. Sin had broken friendship between God and us, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.10">Isaiah 63:10</reference>;
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> his wrath was on us, <reference osisRef="John.3.36">John 3:36</reference>; and we are by nature
   obnoxious to it, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.3">Ephesians 2:3</reference> This is taken away by the death of Christ,
   as it was a sacrifice, <reference osisRef="Dan.9.24">Daniel 9:24</reference> "When we were enemies, we were
   reconciled to God by the death of his Son," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.10">Romans 5:10</reference> And thereby do
   we "receive the atonement," verse 11; for "God was in Christ
   reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins and
   their iniquities," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.19-2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:19-21</reference>: so also, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.12-Eph.2.16">Ephesians 2:12-16</reference>, and in
   sundry other places. And this is the second consideration of the death
   of Christ; which I do but name, having at large insisted on these
   things elsewhere.
				</p><p>
   [3.] It was also a punishment, -- a punishment in our stead. "He was
   wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the
   chastisement of our peace was upon him," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.5">Isaiah 53:5</reference> God made all our
   iniquities (that is, the punishment of them) "to meet upon him," verse
   6. "He bare the sins of many," verse 12; "his own self bare our sins in
   his own body on the tree," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.24">1 Peter 2:24</reference>; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> he "who knew no
   sin, was made sin for us," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference> What it is in the Scripture to
   bear sin, see <reference osisRef="Deut.19.15">Deuteronomy 19:15</reference>, xx. 17; <reference osisRef="Num.14.33">Numbers 14:33</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ezek.18.20">Ezekiel 18:20</reference>
   The nature, kind, matter, and manner of this punishment I have, as I
   said before, elsewhere discussed.
				</p><p>
   Now, bearing of punishment tends directly to the giving satisfaction to
   him who was offended, and on that account inflicted the punishment.
   Justice can desire no more than a proportional punishment, due to the
   offence. And this, on his own voluntary taking of our persons,
   undertaking to be our mediator, was inflicted on our dear Lord Jesus.
   His substituting himself in our room being allowed of by the righteous
   Judge, satisfaction to him does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> thence properly ensue.
				</p><p>
   And this is the threefold consideration of the death of Christ, as it
   is a principal spring and fountain of that grace in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have
   communion with him; for, as will appear in our process, the single and
   most eminent part of purchased grace, is nothing but the natural
   exurgency of the threefold effect of the death of Christ, intimated to
   flow from it on the account of the threefold consideration insisted on.
   This, then, is the second rise of purchased grace, which we are to eye,
   if we will hold communion with Christ in it, -- his death and
   blood-shedding, under this threefold notion of a price, an offering,
   and punishment. But, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) This is not all: the Lord Christ goes farther yet; he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   leave us so, but follows on the work to the utmost. [317] "He died for
   our sins, and rose again for our justification." He rose again to carry
   on the complete work of purchased grace, -- that is, by his
   intercession; which is the third rise of it. In respect of this, he is
   said to be "able to save them to the uttermost that come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by
   him, seeing he ever lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note> to make intercession for them," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.25">Hebrews 7:25</reference>
				</p><p>
   Now, the intercession of Christ, in respect of its influence into
   purchased grace, is considered two ways: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] As a continuance and carrying on of his oblation, for the making
   out of all the fruits and effects of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. This is called his
   "appearing in the presence of God for us," <reference osisRef="Heb.9.24">Hebrews 9:24</reference>; that is, as the
   high priest, having offered the great offering for expiation of sin,
   carried in the blood of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> into the most holy place, where was the
   representation of the presence of God, so to perfect the atonement he
   made for himself and the people; so the Lord Christ, having offered
   himself as a sweet-smelling sacrifice to God, being sprinkled with his
   own blood, appears in the presence of God, as it were to mind him of
   the engagement made to him, for the redemption of sinners by his blood,
   and the making out the good things to them which were procured thereby.
   And so this appearance of his has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> an influence into purchased grace,
   inasmuch as thereby he puts in his claim for it in our behalf.
				</p><p>
   [2.] He procures<note n="procureth">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Spirit for us, effectually to collate and
   bestow all this purchased grace upon us. That he would do this, and
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it, for us, we have his engagement, <reference osisRef="John.14.16">John 14:16</reference> This is
   purchased grace, in respect of its fountain and spring; -- of which I
   shall not speak farther at present, seeing I must handle it at large in
   the matter of the communion we have with the Holy Ghost.

<title>Part 2 Chapter 7</title>
<p>
   The nature of purchased grace; referred to three heads:  1. Of our
   acceptation with God; two parts of it. 2. Of the grace of
   sanctification; the several parts of it.
				</p><p>
   The fountain of that purchased grace in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the saints have communion
   with Christ being discovered, in the next place the nature of this
   grace itself may be considered. As was said, it may be referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   three heads:  1. Grace of acceptation with God. 2. Grace of
   sanctification from God. 3. Grace of privileges with and before God.
				</p><p>
   1. Of acceptation with God. Out of Christ, we are in a state of [318]
   alienation from God, accepted neither in our persons nor our services.
   Sin makes a separation between God and us:  that state, with all its
   consequences and attendancies, [it] is not my business to unfold. The
   first issue of purchased grace is to restore us into a state of
   acceptation. And this is done two ways:  (1.) By a removal of that for
   which we are refused, -- the cause of the enmity. (2.) By a bestowing
   of that for which we are accepted.
				</p><p>
   Not only all causes of quarrel were to be taken away, that so we should
   not be under displeasure, but also that was to be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us that
   makes us the objects of God's delight and pleasure, on the account of
   the want of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are distanced from God: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) It gives a removal of that for which we are refused. This is sin
   in the guilt, and all the attendancies of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. The first issue of
   purchased grace tends to the taking away of sin in its guilt, that it
   shall not bind over the soul to the wages of it, which is death.
				</p><p>
   How this is accomplished and brought about by Christ, was evidenced in
   the close of the foregoing chapter. It is the fruit and effect of his
   death for us. Guilt of sin was the only cause of our separation and
   distance from God, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been said. This made us obnoxious to wrath,
   punishment, and the whole displeasure of God; on the account of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   were we imprisoned under the curse of the law, and given up to the
   power of Satan. This is the state of our unacceptation. By his death,
   Christ -- bearing the curse, undergoing the punishment that was due to
   us, paying the ransom that was due for us -- delivers us from this
   condition. And thus far the death of Christ is the sole cause of our
   acceptation with God, -- that all cause of quarrel and rejection of us
   is thereby taken away. And to that end are his sufferings reckoned to
   us; for, being "made sin for us," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>, he is made
   "righteousness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference>
				</p><p>
   But yet farther; this will not complete our acceptation with God. The
   old quarrel may be laid aside, and yet no new friendship begun; we may
   be not sinners, and yet not be so far righteous as to have a right to
   the kingdom of heaven. Adam had no right to life because he was
   innocent; he must, moreover, "do this," and then he shall "live." He
   must not only have a negative righteousness, -- he was not guilty of
   any thing; but also a positive righteousness, -- he must do all things.
				</p><p>
   (2.) This, then, is required, in the second place, to our complete
   acceptation, that we have not only the not imputation of sin, but also
   a reckoning of righteousness. Now, this we have in the obedience of the
   life of Christ. This also was discovered in the last chapter. The
   obedience of the life of Christ was for us, is imputed to us, and is
   our righteousness before God; -- by his obedience are we "made
   righteous," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.19">Romans 5:19</reference> On what score the obedience of faith takes
   place, shall be afterward declared.
				</p><p>
   These two things, then, complete our grace of acceptation. Sin being
   removed, and righteousness bestowed, we have peace with God, -- are
   continually accepted before him. There is not any thing to charge us
   withal: that which was, is taken out of the way by Christ, and nailed
   to his cross, -- made fast there; yea, publicly and legally cancelled,
   that it can never be admitted again as an evidence. What court among
   men would admit of an evidence that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been publicly cancelled, and
   nailed up for all to see it? So has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> Christ dealt with that which was
   against us; and not only so, but also he puts that upon us for which we
   are received into favour. He makes us comely through his beauty; gives
   us white raiment to stand before the Lord. This is the first part of
   purchased grace in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the saints have communion with Jesus Christ. In
   remission of sin and imputation of righteousness does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it consist; from
   the death of Christ, as a price, sacrifice, and a punishment, -- from
   the life of Christ spent in obedience to the law, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it arise. The
   great product it is of the Father's righteousness, wisdom, love, and
   grace; -- the great and astonishable fruit of the love and
   condescension of the Son; -- the great discovery of the Holy Ghost in
   the revelation of the mystery of the gospel.
				</p><p>
   2. The second is grace of sanctification. He makes us not only
   accepted, but also acceptable. He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not only purchase love for his
   saints, but also makes them lovely. He came not by blood only, but by
   water and blood. He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not only justify his saints from the guilt of
   sin, but also sanctify and wash them from the filth of sin. The first
   is from his life and death as a sacrifice of propitiation; this from
   his death as a purchase, and his life as an example. So the apostle,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.9.14">Hebrews 9:14</reference>; as also <reference osisRef="Eph.5.26-Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:26-27</reference> Two things are eminent in this
   issue of purchased grace:  (1.) The removal of defilement; (2.) The
   bestowing of cleanness in actual grace.
				</p><p>
   (1.) For the first, it is also threefold: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] The habitual cleansing of our nature. We are naturally unclean,
   defiled, -- habitually so; for "Who can bring a clean thing out of an
   unclean?" <reference osisRef="Job.14.4">Job 14:4</reference>; "That which is born of the flesh is flesh," <reference osisRef="John.3.6">John 3:6</reference> It is in the pollution of our blood that we are born, Ezek.
   xvi., -- wholly defiled and polluted. The grace of sanctification,
   purchased by the blood of Christ, removes this defilement of our
   nature. <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.11">1 Corinthians 6:11</reference>, "Such were some of you; but ye are washed, ye
   are sanctified." So also <reference osisRef="Titus.3.3-Titus.3.5">Titus 3:3-5</reference>, "He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> saved us by the
   washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost." How far
   this original, habitual pollution is removed, need not be disputed; it
   is certain the soul is made fair and beautiful in the sight of God.
   Though the sin that does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> defile remains, yet its habitual defilement is
   taken away. But the handling of this lies not in my aim.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Taking away the pollutions of all our actual transgressions. There
   is a defilement attending every actual sin. Our own clothes make us to
   be abhorred, <reference osisRef="Job.9.31">Job 9:31</reference> A spot, a stain, rust, wrinkle, filth, blood,
   attends every sin. Now, <reference osisRef="1John.1.7">1 John 1:7</reference>, "The blood of Jesus Christ
   cleanses<note n="cleanseth">Auto-modernized</note> us from all sin." Besides the defilement of our natures which
   he purges<note n="purgeth">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.5">Titus 3:5</reference>, he takes away the defilement of our persons by
   actual follies. "By one offering he perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified;" by himself he "purged our sins," before he sat down at the
   right hand of the Majesty on high, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   [3.] In our best duties we have defilement, <reference osisRef="Isa.64.6">Isaiah 64:6</reference> Self,
   unbelief, form, drop themselves into all that we do. We may be ashamed
   of our choicest performances. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised that the saints' good
   works shall follow them. Truly, were they to be measured by the rule as
   they come from us, and weighed in the balance of the sanctuary, it
   might be well for us that they might be buried for ever: But the Lord
   Christ first, as our high priest, bears the iniquity, the guilt, and
   provocation, which in severe justice does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> attend them, <reference osisRef="Exod.28.38">Exodus 28:38</reference>; and not only so, but he washes away all their filth and
   defilements. He is as a refiner's fire, to purge both the sons of Levi
   and their offerings; adding, moreover, sweet incense to them, that they
   may be accepted. Whatever is of the Spirit, of himself, of grace, --
   that remains; whatever is of self, flesh, unbelief (that is, hay and
   stubble), -- that he consumes, wastes, takes away. So that the saints'
   good works shall meet them one day with a changed countenance, that
   they shall scarce know them: that which seemed to them to be black,
   deformed, defiled, shall appear beautiful and glorious; they shall not
   be afraid of them, but rejoice to see and follow them.
				</p><p>
   And this cleansing of our natures, persons, and duties, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> its whole
   foundation in the death of Christ. Hence our washing and purifying, our
   cleansing and purging, is ascribed to his blood and the sprinkling
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> meritoriously, this work is done, by the shedding of the blood
   of Christ; efficiently, by its sprinkling. The sprinkling of the blood
   of Christ proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> from the communication of the Holy Ghost; which he
   promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> to us, as purchased by him for us. He is the pure water,
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> we are sprinkled from all our sins, that spirit of judgment
   and burning that takes away the filth and blood of the daughters of
   Zion. And this is the first thing in the grace of sanctification; of
   which more afterward.
				</p><p>
   (2.) By bestowing cleanness as to actual grace. The blood of Christ in
   this purchased grace does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not only take away defilement, but also it
   gives purity; and that also in a threefold gradation: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] It gives the Spirit of holiness to dwell in us. "He is made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us sanctification," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference>, by procuring for us the Spirit of
   sanctification. Our renewing is of the Holy Ghost, who is shed on us
   through Christ alone, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.6">Titus 3:6</reference> This the apostle mainly insists on,
   Rom. viii., -- to wit, that the prime and principal gift of
   sanctification that we receive from Christ, is the indwelling of the
   Spirit, and our following after the guidance of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>. But what concerns
   the Spirit in any kind, must be referred to that which I have to offer
   concerning our communion with him.
				</p><p>
   [2.] He gives us habitual grace; -- a principle of grace, opposed to
   the principle of lust that is in us by nature. This is the grace that
   dwells in us, makes its abode with us; which, according to the distinct
   faculties of our souls in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is, or the distinct objects about
   which it is exercised, receives<note n="receiveth">Auto-modernized</note> various appellations, being indeed all
   but one new principle of life. In the understanding, it is light; in
   the will, obedience; in the affections, love; in all, faith. So, also,
   it is differenced in respect of its operations. When it carries out the
   soul to rest on Christ, it is faith; when to delight in him, it is
   love; but still one and the same habit of grace. And this is the second
   thing.
				</p><p>
   [3.] Actual influence for the performance of every spiritual duty
   whatever. After the saints have both the former, yet Christ tells them
   that without him "they can do nothing," <reference osisRef="John.15.5">John 15:5</reference> They are still in
   dependence upon him for new influences of grace, or supplies of the
   Spirit. They cannot live and spend upon the old stock; for every new
   act they must have new grace. He must "work in us to will and to do of
   his good pleasure," <reference osisRef="Phil.2.13">Philippians 2:13</reference> And in these three, thus briefly
   named, consists that purchased grace in the point of sanctification, as
   to the collating of purity and cleanness, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion
   with Christ.
				</p><p>
   3. This purchased grace consists in privileges to stand before God, and
   these are of two sorts, -- primary and consequential. Primary, is
   adoption, -- the Spirit of adoption; consequential, are all the favours
   of the gospel, which the saints alone have right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. But of this I
   shall speak when I come to the last branch, -- of communion with the
   Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   These are the things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion with Christ as to
   purchased grace in this life. Drive them up to perfection, and you have
   that which we call everlasting glory. Perfect acceptance, perfect
   holiness, perfect adoption, or inheritance of sons, -- that is glory.
				</p><p>
   Our process now, in the next place, is to what I mainly intend, even
   the manner how we hold communion with Christ in these things; and that
   in the order laid down; as, --
				</p><p>
   I. How we hold communion with him in the obedience of his life and
   merit of his death, as to acceptance with God the Father.
				</p><p>
   II. How we hold communion with Christ in his blood, as to the Spirit of
   sanctification, the habits and acts of grace.
				</p><p>
   III. How we hold communion with him as to the privileges we enjoy. Of
   which in the ensuing chapters.

</p>

<title>Part 2 Chapter 8</title>
<p>
   How the saints hold communion with Christ as to their acceptation with
   God -- What is required on the part of Christ to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; in his
   intention; in the declaration of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> -- The sum of our acceptation
   with God, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it consists -- What is required on the part of
   believers to this communion, and how they hold it, with Christ -- Some

   commutation of sin and righteousness between Christ and believers; some
   objections answered.
				</p><p>
   I. Communion with Christ in purchased grace, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> acceptation with
   God, from the obedience of his life and efficacy of his death, is the
   first thing we inquire into. The discovery of what on the part of
   Christ and what on our part is required to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> (for our mutual
   actings, even his and ours, are necessary, that we may have fellowship
   and communion together in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>), is that which in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> I intend.
				</p><p>
   First, On the part of Christ there is no more required but these two
   things:  (1.) That what he did, he did not for himself, but for us.
   (2.) What he suffered, he suffered not for himself, but for us. That
   is, that his intention from eternity, and when he was in the world,
   was, that all that he did and suffered was and should be for us and our
   advantage, as to our acceptance with God; that he still continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note>
   making use of what he so did and suffered for that end and purpose, and
   that only. Now, this is most evident: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) What he did, he did for us, and not for himself: "He was made
   under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4-Gal.4.5">Galatians 4:4-5</reference> He was made under the law; that is, in that condition that he was
   obnoxious to the will and commands of it. And why was this? to what
   end? for himself? No; but to redeem us is the aim of all that he did,
   -- of all his obedience: and that he did. This very intention in what
   he did he acquaints us with, <reference osisRef="John.17.19">John 17:19</reference>, "For their sakes I sanctify
   myself, that they may be sanctified through the truth." "I sanctify
   myself, -- dedicate and set myself apart to all that work I have to do.
   I came not to do my own will; I came to save that which was lost; to
   minister, not to be ministered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; and to give my life a ransom;" --
   it was the testimony he bare to all he did in the world. This
   intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of his is especially to be eyed. From eternity he had
   thoughts of what he would do for us; and delighted himself in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And
   when he was in the world, in all he went about, he had still this
   thought, "This is for them, and this is for them, -- my beloved." When
   he went to be baptised, says John, "I have need to be baptised of you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>,
   and comest you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> to me?" <reference osisRef="Matt.3.14-Matt.3.15">Matthew 3:14-15</reference>; as if he had said, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note>
   have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> no need at all of it." But says Christ, "Suffer it to be so, now;
   for thus it becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> us to fulfil all righteousness;" -- "I do it for
   them who have none at all, and stand obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all."
				</p><p>
   (2.) In what he suffered. This is more clear, <reference osisRef="Dan.9.26">Daniel 9:26</reference>, "Messiah
   shall be cut off, but not for himself." And the apostle lays down this
   as a main difference between him and the high priests of the Jews, that
   when they made their solemn offerings, they offered first for
   themselves, and then for the people; but Jesus Christ offered only for
   others. He had no sin, and could make no sacrifice for his own sin,
   which he had not, but only for others. He "tasted death every man,"
   <reference osisRef="Heb.2.9">Hebrews 2:9</reference>, -- "gave his life a ransom for many," <reference osisRef="Matt.20.28">Matthew 20:28</reference> The
   "iniquity of us all was made to meet on him," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.6">Isaiah 53:6</reference>; -- "He bare
   our sins in his own body on the tree," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.24">1 Peter 2:24</reference>; -- "loved the
   church, and gave himself for it," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25">Ephesians 5:25</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.4.25">Romans 4:25</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5-Rev.1.6">Revelation of John 1:5-6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Titus.2.14">Titus 2:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Tim.2.6">1 Timothy 2:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.53.12">Isaiah 53:12</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.17.19">John 17:19</reference>
   But this is exceeding clear and confessed, that Christ in his suffering
   and oblation, had his intention only upon the good of his elect, and
   their acceptation with God; suffering for us, "the just for the unjust,
   that he might bring us to God."
				</p><p>
   Secondly, To complete this communion on the part of Christ, it is
   required, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) That there be added to what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done, the gospel tenders of
   that complete righteousness and acceptation with God which arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from
   his perfect obedience and sufferings. Now, they are twofold: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] Declaratory, in the conditional promises of the gospel. <reference osisRef="Mark.16.15">Mark 16:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.11.28">Matthew 11:28</reference>, "He that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> shall be saved;" "Come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me,
   and I will give you rest;" "As Moses lifted up the serpent," etc.;
   "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
   believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Rom.10.4">Romans 10:4</reference>; and innumerable others. Now, declaratory tenders
   are very precious, there is much kindness in them, and if they be
   rejected, they will be the "savour of death to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death;" but the Lord
   Christ knows that the outward letter, though never so effectually held
   out, will not enable any of his for that reception of his righteousness
   which is necessary to interest them in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, --
				</p><p>
   [2.] In this tender of acceptation with God, on the account of what he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done and suffered, a law is established, that whosoever receives
   it shall be so accepted. But Christ knows the condition and state of
   his in this world. This will not do; if he do not effectually invest
   them with it, all is lost. Therefore, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) He sends them his Holy Spirit, to quicken them, <reference osisRef="John.6.63">John 6:63</reference>, to
   cause them that are "dead to hear his voice," <reference osisRef="John.5.25">John 5:25</reference>; and to work
   in them whatever is required of them, to make them partakers of his
   righteousness and accepted with God.
				</p><p>
   Thus does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> Christ deal with his:  he lives and dies with an intention
   to work out and complete righteousness for them; their enjoying of it,
   to a perfect acceptation before God, is all that in the one and other
   he aimed at. Then he tenders it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, declares the usefulness and
   preciousness of it to their souls, stirring them up to a desire and
   valuation of it; and lastly, effectually bestows it upon them, reckons
   it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them as theirs, that they should by it, for it, with it, be
   perfectly accepted with his Father.
				</p><p>
   Thus, for our acceptation with God, two things are required: 
				</p><p>
   First, That satisfaction be made for our disobedience, -- for whatever
   we had done which might damage the justice and honour of God; and that
   God be atoned towards us: which could no otherwise be, but by
   undergoing the penalty of the law. This, I have showed abundantly, is
   done by the death of Christ. God "made him to be sin for us," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>, -- a "curse," <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference> On this account we have our absolution,
   -- our acquitment from the guilt of sin, the sentence of the law, the
   wrath of God, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.33-Rom.8.34">Romans 8:33-34</reference> We are justified, acquitted, freed
   from condemnation, because it was Christ that died; "he bare our sins
   in his own body on the tree," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.24">1 Peter 2:24</reference>
				</p><p>
   Second, That the righteousness of the law be fulfilled, and the
   obedience performed that is required at our hands. And this is done by
   the life of Christ, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.18-Rom.5.19">Romans 5:18-19</reference> So that answerable to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>,
   according to our state and the condition of our acceptation with God,
   there are two parts: 
				</p><p>
   Our absolution from the guilt of sin, that our disobedience be not
   charged upon us. This we have by the death of Christ; our sins being
   imputed to him, shall not be imputed to us, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.4.25">Romans 4:25</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="Isa.53.12">Isaiah 53:12</reference>
				</p><p>
   Imputation of righteousness, that we may be accounted perfectly
   righteous before God; and this we have by the life of Christ. His
   righteousness in yielding obedience to the law is imputed to us. And
   thus is our acceptation with God completed. Being discharged from the
   guilt of our disobedience by the death of Christ, and having the
   righteousness of the life of Christ imputed to us, we have friendship
   and peace with God. And this is that which I call our grace of
   acceptation with God, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion with Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   That which remains for me to do, is to show how believers hold distinct
   communion with Christ in this grace of acceptation, and how thereby
   they keep alive a sense of it, -- the comfort and life of it being to
   be renewed every day. Without this, life is a hell; no peace, no joy
   can we be made partakers of, but what has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> its rise from hence. Look
   what grounded persuasion we have of our acceptation with God, that he
   is at peace with us; to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> is the revenue of our peace, comfort,
   joy, yea, and holiness itself, proportioned.
				</p><p>
   But yet, before I come in particular to handle our practical communion
   with the Lord Jesus in this thing, I must remove two considerable
   objections; -- the one of them lying against the first part of our
   acceptation with God, the other against the latter.
				</p><p>
   Objection 1. For our absolution by and upon the death of Christ, it may
   be said, that "if the elect have their absolution, reconciliation, and
   freedom by the death, blood, and cross of Christ, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is it, then,
   that they were not all actually absolved at the death of Christ, or at
   least so soon as they are born, but that many of them live a long while
   under the wrath of God in this world, as being unbelievers, under the
   sentence and condemning power of the law? <reference osisRef="John.3.36">John 3:36</reference> Why are they
   not immediately freed, upon the payment of the price and making
   reconciliation for them?"
				</p><p>
   Obj. 2. "If the obedience of the life of Christ be imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and
   that is our righteousness before God, then what need we yield any
   obedience ourselves? Is not all our praying, labouring, watching,
   fasting, giving alms, -- are not all fruits of holiness, in purity of
   heart and usefulness of conversation, all in vain and to no purpose?
   And who, then, will or need take care to be holy, humble, righteous,
   meek, temperate, patient, good, peaceable, or to abound in good works
   in the world?"
				</p><p>
   1. I shall, God assisting, briefly remove these two objections, and
   then proceed to carry on the design in hand, about our communion with
   Christ: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) Jesus Christ, in his undertaking of the work of our reconciliation
   with God, -- for which cause he came into the world, -- and the
   accomplishment of it by his death, was constituted and considered as a
   common, public person, in the stead of them for whose reconciliation to
   God he suffered. Hence he is the "mediator between God and man," <reference osisRef="1Tim.2.5">1 Timothy 2:5</reference>, -- that is, one who undertook to God for us, as the next words
   manifest, verse 6, "Who gave himself a ransom for all," -- and the
   "surety of the better covenant," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.22">Hebrews 7:22</reference>; undertaking for and on
   the behalf of them with whom that covenant was made. Hence he is said
   to be given "for a covenant of the people," <reference osisRef="Isa.42.6">Isaiah 42:6</reference>; and a
   "leader," lv. 4. He was the second Adam, <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.45 1Cor.15.47">1 Corinthians 15:45, 47</reference>, to all ends
   and purposes of righteousness, to his spiritual seed, as the first Adam
   was of sin to his natural seed, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.15-Rom.5.19">Romans 5:15-19</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) His being thus a common person, arose chiefly from these things: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] In general, from the covenant entered into by himself with his
   Father to this purpose. The terms of this covenant are at large
   insisted on, Isa. liii., summed up, <reference osisRef="Ps.40.7-Ps.40.8">Psalms 40:7-8</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.10.8-Heb.10.10">Hebrews 10:8-10</reference> Hence
   the Father became to be his God; which is a covenant expression, <reference osisRef="Ps.89.26">Psalms 89:26</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.5">Hebrews 1:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.22.1">Psalms 22:1</reference>, xl. 8, xlv. 7; <reference osisRef="Rev.3.12">Revelation of John 3:12</reference>; <reference osisRef="Mic.5.4">Micah 5:4</reference> So was he by his Father on this account designed to this work,
   <reference osisRef="Isa.42.1 Isa.42.6">Isaiah 42:1, 6</reference>, xlix. 9; <reference osisRef="Mal.3.1">Malachi 3:1</reference>; <reference osisRef="Zech.13.7">Zechariah 13:7</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Tim.1.15">1 Timothy 1:15</reference> Thus the "counsel of peace" became to be "between them
   both," <reference osisRef="Zech.6.13">Zechariah 6:13</reference>; that is, the Father and Son. And the Son rejoices
   from eternity in the thought of this undertaking, <reference osisRef="Prov.8.22-Prov.8.30">Proverbs 8:22-30</reference>
   The command given him to this purpose, the promises made to him
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, the assistance afforded to him, I have elsewhere handled.
				</p><p>
   [2.] In the sovereign grant, appointment, and design of the Father,
   giving and delivering the elect to Jesus Christ in this covenant, to be
   redeemed and reconciled to himself. <reference osisRef="John.17.6">John 17:6</reference>, "Your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> they were, and
   you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> gavest them me." They were God's by eternal designation and
   election, and he gave them to Christ to be redeemed. Hence, before
   their calling or believing, he calls them his "sheep," <reference osisRef="John.10.15-John.10.16">John 10:15-16</reference>,
   laying down his life for them as such; and hence are we said to be
   "chosen in Christ," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</reference>, or designed to obtain all the fruits of
   the love of God by Christ, and committed into his hand for that end and
   purpose.
				</p><p>
   [3.] In his undertaking to suffer what was due to them, and to do what
   was to be done by them, that they might be delivered, reconciled, and
   accepted with God. And he undertakes to give in to the Father, without
   loss or miscarriage, what he had so received of the Father as above,
   <reference osisRef="John.17.2 John.17.12">John 17:2, 12</reference>, vi. 37, 39; as Jacob did the cattle he received of
   Laban, <reference osisRef="Gen.31.39-Gen.31.40">Genesis 31:39-40</reference> Of both these I have treated somewhat at
   large elsewhere, in handling the covenant between the Father and the
   Son; so that I shall not need to take it up here again.
				</p><p>
   [4.] They being given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, he undertaking for them to do and
   suffer what was on their part required, he received, on their behalf
   and for them, all the promises of all the mercies, grace, good things,
   and privileges, which they were to receive upon the account of his
   undertaking for them. On this account eternal life is said to be
   promised of God "before the world began," <reference osisRef="Titus.1.2">Titus 1:2</reference>; that is, to the
   Son of God for us, on his undertaking on our behalf. And grace, also,
   is said to be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us "before the world began," <reference osisRef="2Tim.1.9">2 Timothy 1:9</reference>; that
   is, in Christ, our appointed head, mediator, and representative.
				</p><p>
   [5.] Christ being thus a common person, a mediator, surety, and
   representative, of his church, upon his undertaking, as to efficacy and
   merit, and upon his actual performance, as to solemn declaration, was
   as such acquitted, absolved, justified, and freed, from all and every
   thing that, on the behalf of the elect, as due to them, was charged
   upon him, or could so be; I say, as to all the efficacy and merit of
   his undertakings, he was immediately absolved upon his faithfulness, in
   his first engagement: and thereby all the saints of the Old Testament
   were saved by his blood no less than we. As to solemn declaration, he
   was so absolved when, the "pains of death being loosed", he was
   "declared to be the Son of God with power, by the resurrection from the
   dead;" <reference osisRef="Rom.1.4">Romans 1:4</reference>, God saying to him, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> my Son; this day have I
   begotten you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Ps.2.7">Psalms 2:7</reference> And this his absolution does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> Christ express
   his confidence of, <reference osisRef="Isa.50.5-Isa.50.9">Isaiah 50:5-9</reference> And he was "justified," <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>
   That which I intend by this absolution of Christ as a public person is
   this:  God having made him under the law, for them who were so, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference>; in their stead, obnoxious to the punishment due to sin, made him
   sin, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>; and so gave justice, and law, and all the
   consequents of the curse of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, power against him, <reference osisRef="Isa.53.6">Isaiah 53:6</reference>; --
   upon his undergoing of that which was required of him, verse 12, God
   looses the pains and power of death, accepts him, and is well pleased
   with him, as to the performance and discharge of his work, <reference osisRef="John.17.3-John.17.6">John 17:3-6</reference>; pronounces<note n="pronounceth">Auto-modernized</note> him free from the obligation that was on him, Acts
   xiii.; and gave him a promise of all good things he aimed at, and which
   his soul desired. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> are all the promises of God made to Christ,
   and their accomplishment, -- all the encouragements given him to ask
   and make demand of the things originally engaged for to him, <reference osisRef="Ps.2.8">Psalms 2:8</reference>,
   (which he did accordingly, John xvii.), -- founded and built. And here
   lies the certain, stable foundation of our absolution, and acceptation
   with God. Christ in our stead, acting for us as our surety, being
   acquitted, absolved, solemnly declared to have answered the whole debt
   that was incumbent on him to pay, and made satisfaction for all the
   injury we had done, a general pardon is sealed for us all, to be sued
   out particularly in the way to be appointed. For, --
				</p><p>
   [6.] Christ as a public person being thus absolved, it became righteous
   with God, a righteous thing, from the covenant, compact, and
   convention, that was between him and the Mediator, that those in whose
   stead he was, should obtain, and have bestowed on them, all the fruits
   of his death, in reconciliation with God, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.8-Rom.5.11">Romans 5:8-11</reference>; that as Christ
   received the general acquittance for them all, so they should every one
   of them enjoy it respectively. This is everywhere manifested in those
   expressions which express a commutation designed by God in this matter;
   as <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.21 1Pet.2.24">1 Peter 2:21, 24</reference>; -- of which
   afterward.
				</p><p>
   [7.] Being thus acquitted in the covenant of the Mediator (from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they
   are said to be circumcised with him, to die with him, to be buried with
   him, to rise with him, to sit with him in heavenly places, -- namely,
   in the covenant of the Mediator), and it being righteous that they
   should be acquitted personally in the covenant of grace, it was
   determined by Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that the way of their actual
   personal deliverance from the sentence and curse of the law should be
   in and by such a way and dispensation as might lead to the praise of
   the glorious grace of God, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.5-Eph.1.7">Ephesians 1:5-7</reference> The appointment of God is, that
   we shall have the adoption of children. The means of it, is by Jesus
   Christ; the peculiar way of bringing it about, is by the redemption
   that is in his blood; the end, is the praise of his glorious grace. And
   thence it is, --
				</p><p>
   [8.] That until the full time of their actual deliverance, determined
   and appointed to them in their several generations, be accomplished,
   they are personally under the curse of the law; and, on that account,
   are legally obnoxious to the wrath of God, from which they shall
   certainly be delivered; -- I say, they are thus personally obnoxious to
   the law, and the curse of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; but not at all with its primitive
   intention of execution upon them, but as it is a means appointed to
   help forward their acquaintance with Christ, and acceptance with God,
   on his account. When this is accomplished, that whole obligation
   ceases, being continued on them in a design of love; their last
   condition being such as that they cannot without it be brought to a
   participation of Christ, to the praise of the glorious grace of God.
				</p><p>
   [9.] The end of the dispensation of grace being to glorify the whole
   Trinity, the order fixed on and appointed in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this is to be done,
   is, by ascending to the Father's love through the work of the Spirit
   and blood of the Son. The emanation of divine love to us begins with
   the Father, is carried on by the Son, and then communicated by the
   Spirit; the Father designing, the Son purchasing, the Spirit
   effectually working: which is their order. Our participation is first
   by the work of the Spirit, to an actual interest in the blood of the
   Son; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> we have acceptation with the Father.
				</p><p>
   This, then, is the order through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are brought to acceptation with the
   Father, for the glory of God through Christ: 
				</p><p>
   1st. That the Spirit may be glorified, he is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, to quicken
   us, convert us, work faith in us, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.11">Romans 8:11</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.19-Eph.1.20">Ephesians 1:19-20</reference>;
   according to all the promises of the covenant, <reference osisRef="Isa.4.4-Isa.4.5">Isaiah 4:4-5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ezek.11.19">Ezekiel 11:19</reference>, xxxvi. 26.
				</p><p>
   2dly. This being wrought in us, for the glory of the Son, we are
   actually interested, according to the tenor of the covenant, at the
   same instant of time, in the blood of Christ, as to the benefits which
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> procured for us thereby; yea, this very work of the Spirit
   itself is a fruit and part of the purchase of Christ. But we speak of
   our sense of this thing, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> the communication of the Spirit is
   antecedent. And, --
				</p><p>
   3dly. To the glory of the Father, we are accepted with him, justified,
   freed from guilt, pardoned, and have "peace with God," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.1">Romans 5:1</reference> Thus,
   "through Christ we have access by one Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.17">Ephesians 2:17</reference> And thus are both Father and Son and the Holy Spirit glorified in
   our justification and acceptation with God; the Father in his free
   love, the Son in his full purchase, and the Holy Spirit in his
   effectual working.
				</p><p>
   [10.] All this, in all the parts of it, is no less fully procured for
   us, nor less freely bestowed on us, for Christ's sake, on his account,
   as part of his purchase and merits, than if all of us immediately upon
   his death, had been translated into heaven; only this way of our
   deliverance and freedom is fixed on, that the whole Trinity may be
   glorified thereby. And this may suffice in answer to the first
   objection. Though our reconciliation with God be fully and completely
   procured by the death of Christ, and all the ways and means through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it
   is accomplished; yet we are brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> an actual enjoyment of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>,
   by the way and in the order mentioned, for the praise of the glorious
   grace of God.
				</p><p>
   2. The second objection is, "That if the righteousness and obedience of
   Christ to the law be imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, then what need we yield obedience
   ourselves?" To this, also, I shall return answer as briefly as I can in
   the ensuing observations: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) The placing of our gospel obedience on the right foot of account
   (that it may neither be exalted into a state, condition, use, or end,
   not given it of God; nor any reason, cause, motive, end, necessity of
   it, on the other hand, taken away, weakened, or impaired), is a matter
   of great importance. Some make our obedience, the works of faith, our
   works, the matter or cause of our justification; some, the condition of
   the imputation of the righteousness of Christ; some, the qualification
   of the person justified, on the one hand; some exclude all the
   necessity of them, and turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, on
   the other. To debate these differences is not my present business;
   only, I say, on this and other accounts, the right stating of our
   obedience is of great importance as to our walking with God.
				</p><p>
   (2.) We do by no means assign the same place, condition, state, and use
   to the obedience of Christ imputed to us, and our obedience performed
   to God. If we did, they were really inconsistent. And therefore those
   who affirm that our obedience is the condition or cause of our
   justification, do all of them deny the imputation of the obedience of
   Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. The righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, as that
   on the account of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are accepted and esteemed righteous before
   God, and are really so, though not inherently. We are as truly
   righteous with the obedience of Christ imputed to us as Adam was, or
   could have been, by a complete righteousness of his own performance. So
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.18">Romans 5:18</reference>, by his obedience we are made righteous, -- made so truly,
   and so accepted; as by the disobedience of Adam we are truly made
   trespassers, and so accounted. And this is that which the apostle
   desires to be found in, in opposition to his own righteousness, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.9">Philippians 3:9</reference> But our own obedience is not the righteousness whereupon we are
   accepted and justified before God; although it be acceptable to God
   that we should abound in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And this distinction the apostle does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   evidently deliver and confirm, so as nothing can be more clearly
   revealed: <reference osisRef="Eph.2.8-Eph.2.10">Ephesians 2:8-10</reference>, "For by grace are ye saved through faith: and
   that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any
   man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> good works, which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> prepared that we should walk in them."
   We are saved, or justified (for that it is of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle treats),
   "by grace through faith," which receives Jesus Christ and his
   obedience; "not of works, lest any man should boast." "But what works
   are they that the apostle intends?" The works of believers, as in the
   very beginning of the next words is manifest: "?For we are,' we
   believers, with our obedience and our works, of whom I speak." "Yea;
   but what need, then, of works?" Need still there is: "We are his
   workmanship," etc.
				</p><p>
   Two things the apostle intimates in these words: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] A reason why we cannot be saved by works, -- namely, because we do
   them not in or by our own strength; which is necessary we should do, if
   we will be saved by them, or justified by them. "But this is not so,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle; "for we are the workmanship of God," etc.; -- all
   our works are wrought in us, by full and effectual undeserved grace.
				</p><p>
   [2.] An assertion of the necessity of good works, notwithstanding that
   we are not saved by them; and that is, that God has ordained that we
   shall walk in them: which is a sufficient ground of our obedience,
   whatever be the use of it.
				</p><p>
   If you will say then, "What are the true and proper gospel grounds,
   reasons, uses, and motives of our obedience; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> the necessity
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> may be demonstrated, and our souls be stirred up to abound and
   be fruitful in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>?" I say, they are so many, and lie so deep in the
   mystery of the gospel and dispensation of grace, spread themselves so
   throughout the whole revelation of the will of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, that to
   handle them fully and distinctly, and to give them their due weight, is
   a thing that I cannot engage in, lest I should be turned aside from
   what I principally intend. I shall only give you some brief heads of
   what might at large be insisted on: 
				</p><p>
   1st. Our universal obedience and good works are indispensably
   necessary, from the sovereign appointment and will of God; Father, Son,
   and Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   In general. "This is the will of God, even your sanctification," or
   holiness, <reference osisRef="1Thess.4.3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</reference> This is that which God wills, which he
   requires of us, -- that we be holy, that we be obedient, that we do his
   will as the angels do in heaven. The equity, necessity, profit, and
   advantage of this ground of our obedience might at large be insisted
   on; and, were there no more, this might suffice alone, -- if it be the
   will of God, it is our duty: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordained or appointed it. It is the will of the
   Father, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.10">Ephesians 2:10</reference> The Father is spoken of personally, Christ being
   mentioned as mediator.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) The Son has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordained and appointed it as mediator. <reference osisRef="John.15.16">John 15:16</reference>, "?I have ordained you, that ye should bring forth fruit' of
   obedience, and that it should remain." And, --
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) The Holy Ghost appoints and ordains believers to works of
   obedience and holiness, and to work holiness in others. So, in
   particular, <reference osisRef="Acts.13.2">Acts 13:2</reference>, he appoints and designs men to the great work
   of obedience in preaching the gospel. And in sinning, men sin against
   him.
				</p><p>
   2dly. Our holiness, our obedience, work of righteousness, is one
   eminent and special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> end of the peculiar dispensation of Father, Son,
   and Spirit, in the business of exalting the glory of God in our
   salvation, -- of the electing love of the Father, the purchasing love
   of the Son, and the operative love of the Spirit: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) It is a peculiar end of the electing love of the Father, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</reference>, "He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> chosen us, that we should be holy and without blame." So
   <reference osisRef="Isa.4.3-Isa.4.4">Isaiah 4:3-4</reference> His aim and design in choosing of us was, that we should
   be holy and unblamable before him in love. This he is to accomplish,
   and will bring about in them that are his. "He chooses us to salvation,
   through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth," <reference osisRef="2Thess.2.13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</reference> This the Father designed as the first and immediate end
   of electing love; and proposes the consideration of that love as a
   motive to holiness, <reference osisRef="1John.4.8-1John.4.10">1 John 4:8-10</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) It is so also of the exceeding love of the Son; of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the
   testimonies are innumerable. I shall give but one or two:  <reference osisRef="Titus.2.14">Titus 2:14</reference>, "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity, and purify to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works." This was his aim, his design, in giving himself for us; as <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25-Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:25-27</reference>, "Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he
   might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word;
   that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot,
   or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and without
   blemish." <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.15">2 Corinthians 5:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.6.11">Romans 6:11</reference>
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) It is the very work of the love of the Holy Ghost. His whole
   work upon us, in us, for us, consists in preparing of us for obedience;
   enabling of us to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, and bringing forth the fruits of it in us.
   And this he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> in opposition to a righteousness of our own, either
   before it or to be made up by it, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.5">Titus 3:5</reference> I need not insist on
   this. The fruits of the Spirit in us are known, <reference osisRef="Gal.5.22-Gal.5.23">Galatians 5:22-23</reference>
				</p><p>
   And thus have we a twofold bottom of the necessity of our obedience and
   personal holiness:  God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed it, he requires it; and it is
   an eminent immediate end of the distinct dispensation of Father, Son,
   and Holy Ghost, in the work of our salvation. If God's sovereignty over
   us is to be owned, if his love towards us be to be regarded, if the
   whole work of the ever-blessed Trinity, for us, in us, be of any
   moment, our obedience is necessary.
				</p><p>
   3dly. It is necessary in respect of the end of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; and that whether
   you consider God, ourselves, or the world: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The end of our obedience, in respect of God, is, his glory and
   honour, <reference osisRef="Mal.1.6">Malachi 1:6</reference> This is God's honour, -- all that we give him. It is
   true, he will take his honour from the stoutest and proudest rebel in
   the world; but all we give him is in our obedience. The glorifying of
   God by our obedience is all that we are or can be. Particularly, --
				</p><p>
   [1st.] It is the glory of the Father. <reference osisRef="Matt.5.16">Matthew 5:16</reference>, "Let your light so
   shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
   Father which is in heaven." By our walking in the light of faith does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   glory arise to the Father. The fruits of his love, of his grace, of his
   kindness, are seen upon us; and God is glorified in our behalf. And, --
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] The Son is glorified thereby. It is the will of God that as all
   men honour the Father, so should they honour the Son, <reference osisRef="John.5.23">John 5:23</reference> And
   how is this done? By believing in him, <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>; obeying of him.
   Hence, <reference osisRef="John.17.10">John 17:10</reference>, he says he is glorified in believers; and prays
   for an increase of grace and union for them, that he may yet be more
   glorified, and all might know that, as mediator, he was sent of God.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] The Spirit is glorified also by it. He is grieved by our
   disobedience, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.30">Ephesians 4:30</reference>; and therefore his glory is in our bringing
   forth fruit. He dwells in us, as in his temple; which is not to be
   defiled. Holiness becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> his habitation for ever.
				</p><p>
   Now, if this that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been said be not sufficient to evince a
   necessity of our obedience, we must suppose ourselves to speak with a
   sort of men who regard neither the sovereignty, nor love, nor glory of
   God, Father, Son, or Holy Ghost. Let men say what they please, though
   our obedience should be all lost, and never regarded (which is
   impossible, for God is not unjust, to forget our labour of love), yet
   here is a sufficient bottom, ground, and reason of yielding more
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God than ever we shall do while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> we live in this world.
   I speak also only of gospel grounds of obedience, and not of those that
   are natural and legal, which are indispensable to all mankind.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) The end in respect of ourselves immediately is threefold: 
   [1st.] Honour. [2dly.] Peace. [3dly.] Usefulness.
				</p><p>
   [1st.] Honour. It is by holiness that we are made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and
   his image is renewed again in us. This was our honour at our creation,
   this exalted us above all our fellow-creatures here below, -- we were
   made in the image of God. This we lost by sin, and became like the
   beasts that perish. To this honour, of conformity to God, of bearing
   his image, are we exalted again by holiness alone. "Be ye holy," says
   God, "for I am holy," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.16">1 Peter 1:16</reference>; and, "Be ye perfect" (that is, in
   doing good), "even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," <reference osisRef="Matt.5.48">Matthew 5:48</reference>, -- in a likeness and conformity to him. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is the image
   of God renewed; <reference osisRef="Eph.4.23-Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:23-24</reference>, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> we "put on the new man, which
   after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth." This was
   that which originally was attended with power and dominion; -- is still
   all that is beautiful or comely in the world. How it makes men
   honourable and precious in the sight of God, of angels, of men; how
   alone it is that which is not despised, which is of price before the
   Lord; what contempt and scorn he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> of them in whom it is not, -- in
   what abomination he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> them and all their ways, -- might easily be
   evinced.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] Peace. By it we have communion with God, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> peace alone is
   to be enjoyed. "The wicked are like the troubled sea, that cannot
   rest;" and, "There is no peace" to them, "says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> my God," <reference osisRef="Isa.57.20-Isa.57.21">Isaiah 57:20-21</reference> There is no peace, rest, or quietness, in a distance, separation,
   or alienation from God. He is the rest of our souls. In the light of
   his countenance is life and peace. Now, "if we walk in the light, as he
   is in the light, we have fellowship one with another," <reference osisRef="1John.1.7">1 John 1:7</reference>;
   "and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
   Christ," verse 3. He that walks in the light of new obedience, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   communion with God, and in his presence is fulness of joy for ever;
   without it, there is nothing but darkness, and wandering, and
   confusion.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] Usefulness. A man without holiness is good for nothing.
   "Ephraim," says the prophet, "is an empty vine, that brings forth fruit
   to itself." And what is such a vine good for? Nothing. Says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> another
   prophet, "A man cannot make so much as a pin of it, to hang a vessel
   on." A barren tree is good for nothing, but to be cut down for the
   fire. Notwithstanding the seeming usefulness of men who serve the
   providence of God in their generations, I could easily manifest that
   the world and the church might want them, and that, indeed, in
   themselves they are good for nothing. Only the holy man is commune
   bonum.
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) The end of it in respect of others in the world is manifold: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] It serves to the conviction and stopping the mouths of some of
   the enemies of God, both here and hereafter:  1. Here. <reference osisRef="1Pet.3.16">1 Peter 3:16</reference>,
   "Having a good conscience; that, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they speak evil of you, as of
   evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good
   conversation in Christ." By our keeping of a good conscience men will
   be made ashamed of their false accusations; that whereas their malice
   and hatred of the ways of God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provoked them to speak all manner of
   evil of the profession of them, by the holiness and righteousness of
   the saints, they are convinced and made ashamed, as a thief is when he
   is taken, and be driven to acknowledge that God is amongst them, and
   that they are wicked themselves, <reference osisRef="John.17.23">John 17:23</reference> 2. Hereafter. It is
   said that the saints shall judge the world. It is on this, as well as
   upon other considerations: their good works, their righteousness, their
   holiness, shall be brought forth, and manifested to all the world; and
   the righteousness of God's judgments against wicked men be thence
   evinced. "See," says Christ, "these are they that I own, whom you so
   despised and abhorred; and see their works following them: this and
   that they have done, when you wallowed in your abominations," <reference osisRef="Matt.25.42-Matt.25.43">Matthew 25:42-43</reference>
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] The conversion of others. <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.12">1 Peter 2:12</reference>, "Having your
   conversation honest among the Gentiles; that, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they speak
   against you as evil-doers, they may, by your good works, which they
   shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation," <reference osisRef="Matt.5.16">Matthew 5:16</reference> Even
   revilers, persecutors, evil-speakers, have been overcome by the
   constant holy walking of professors; and when their day of visitation
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> come, have glorified God on that account, <reference osisRef="1Pet.3.1-1Pet.3.2">1 Peter 3:1-2</reference>
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] The benefit of all; partly in keeping off judgments from the
   residue of men, as ten good men would have preserved Sodom: [319]
   partly by their real communication of good to them with whom they have
   to do in their generation. Holiness makes a man a good man, useful to
   all; and others eat of the fruits of the Spirit that he brings forth
   continually.
				</p><p>
   [4thly.] It is necessary in respect of the state and condition of
   justified persons; and that whether you consider their relative state
   of acceptation, or their state of sanctification: 
				</p><p>
   First. They are accepted and received into friendship with a holy God,
   -- a God of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, -- who hates every
   unclean thing. And is it not necessary that they should be holy who are
   admitted into his presence, walk in his sight, -- yea, lie in his
   bosom? Should they not with all diligence cleanse themselves from all
   pollution of [320] flesh and spirit, and perfect holiness in the fear
   of the Lord?
				</p><p>
   Secondly. In respect of sanctification. We have in us a new creature, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.17">2 Corinthians 5:17</reference> This new creature is fed, cherished, nourished, kept alive,
   by the fruits of holiness. To what end has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> God given us new hearts,
   and new natures? Is it that we should kill them? stifle the creature
   that is found in us in the womb? that we should give him to the old man
   to be devoured?
				</p><p>
   [5thly.] It is necessary in respect of the proper place of holiness in
   the new covenant; and that is twofold: 
				</p><p>
   First. Of the means to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed that holiness
   shall be the means, [321] the way to that eternal life, which, as in
   itself and originally [it] is his gift by Jesus Christ, so, with regard
   to his constitution of our obedience, as the means of attaining it,
   [it] is a reward, and God in bestowing of it a rewarder. Though it be
   neither the cause, matter, nor condition of our justification, yet it
   is the way appointed of God for us to walk in for the obtaining of
   salvation. And therefore, he that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> hope of eternal life purifies
   himself, as he is pure: and none shall ever come to that end who
   walks<note n="walketh">Auto-modernized</note> not in that way; for without holiness it is impossible to see
   God.
				</p><p>
   Secondly. It is a testimony and pledge of adoption, -- a sign and
   evidence of grace; that is, of acceptation with God. And, --
				</p><p>
   Thirdly. The whole expression of our thankfulness.
				</p><p>
   Now, there is not one of all these causes and reasons of the necessity,
   the indispensable necessity of our obedience, good works, and personal
   righteousness, but would require a more large discourse to unfold and
   explain than I have allotted to the proposal of them all; and
   innumerable others there are of the same import, that I cannot name. He
   that upon these accounts does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not think universal holiness and
   obedience to be of indispensable necessity, unless also it be exalted
   into the room of the obedience and righteousness of Christ, let him be
   filthy still.
				</p><p>
   These objections being removed, and having, at the entrance of this
   chapter, declared what is done on the part of Christ, as to our
   fellowship with him in this purchased grace, as to our acceptation with
   God, it remains that I now show what also is required and performed on
   our part for the completing of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. This, then, consists in the
   ensuing particulars: 
				</p><p>
   1. The saints cordially approve of this righteousness, as that alone
   which is absolutely complete, and able to make them acceptable before
   God. And this supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> six things: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) Their clear and full conviction of the necessity of a
   righteousness with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> to appear before God. This is always in their
   thoughts; this in their whole lives they take for granted. Many men
   spend their days in obstinacy and hardness, adding drunkenness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   thirst, never once inquiring what their condition shall be when they
   enter into eternity; others trifle away their time and their souls,
   sowing the wind of empty hopes, and preparing to reap a whirlwind of
   wrath; but this lies at the bottom of all the saints' communion with
   Christ, -- a deep, fixed, resolved persuasion of an absolute and
   indispensable necessity of a righteousness with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> to appear before
   God. The holiness of God's nature, the righteousness of his government,
   the severity of his law, the terror of his wrath, are always before
   them. They have been all convinced of sin, and have looked on
   themselves as ready to sink under the vengeance due to it. They have
   all cried, "Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?" "With which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>
   shall we come before God?" and have all concluded, that it is in vain
   to flatter themselves with hopes of escaping as they are by nature. If
   God be holy and righteous, and of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,
   they must have a righteousness to stand before him; and they know what
   will be the cry one day of those who now bear up themselves, as if they
   were otherwise minded, <reference osisRef="Isa.53.1-Isa.53.5">Isaiah 53:1-5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Mic.6.6-Mic.6.7">Micah 6:6-7</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) They weigh their own righteousness in the balance, and find it
   wanting; and this two ways: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] In general, and upon the whole of the matter, at their first
   setting themselves before God. When men are convinced of the necessity
   of a righteousness, they catch at every thing that presents itself to
   them for relief. Like men ready to sink in deep waters, [they] catch at
   that which is next, to save them from drowning; which sometimes proves
   a rotten stick, that sinks with them. So did the Jews, <reference osisRef="Rom.9.31-Rom.9.32">Romans 9:31-32</reference>;
   they caught hold of the law, and it would not relieve them; and how
   they perished with it the apostle declares, chap. x. 1-4. The law put
   them upon setting up a righteousness of their own. This kept them
   doing, and in hope; but kept them from submitting to the righteousness
   of God. Here many perish, and never get one step nearer God all their
   days. This the saints renounce; they have no confidence in the flesh:
   they know that all they can do, all that the law can do, which is weak
   through the flesh, will not avail them. See what judgment Paul makes of
   all a man's own righteousness, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8-Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:8-10</reference> This they bear in their
   minds daily, this they fill their thoughts withal, that upon the
   account of what they have done, can do, ever shall do, they cannot be
   accepted with God, or justified thereby. This keeps their souls humble,
   full of a sense of their own vileness, all their days.
				</p><p>
   [2.] In particular. They daily weigh all their particular actions in
   the balance, and find them wanting, as to any such completeness as,
   upon their own account, to be accepted with God. "Oh!" says a saint,
   "if I had nothing to commend me to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God but this prayer, this duty,
   this conquest of a temptation, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I myself see so many failings,
   so much imperfection, could I appear with any boldness before him?
   Shall I, then, piece up a garment of righteousness out of my best
   duties? Ah! it is all as a defiled cloth," <reference osisRef="Isa.64.6">Isaiah 64:6</reference> These thoughts
   accompany them in all their duties, in their best and most choice
   performances:  "Lord, what am I in my best estate? How little
   suitableness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> holiness is in my best duties! O spare me, in
   reference to the best thing that ever I did in my life!" <reference osisRef="Neh.13.22">Nehemiah 13:22</reference>
   When a man who lives upon convictions has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> got some enlargements in
   duties, some conquest over a sin or temptation, he hugs himself, like
   Micah when he had got a Levite to be his priest: now surely it shall be
   well with him, now God will bless him: his heart is now at ease; he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> peace in what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done. But he who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> communion with Christ,
   when he is highest in duties of sanctification and holiness, is
   clearest in the apprehension of his own unprofitableness, and rejects
   every thought that might arise in his heart of setting his peace in
   them, or upon them. He says to his soul, "Do these things seem
   something to you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>? Alas! you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> to do with an infinitely righteous
   God, who looks through and through all that vanity, which you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> but
   little acquainted withal; and should he deal with you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> according to your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   best works, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> must perish."
				</p><p>
   (3.) They approve of, value, and rejoice in, this righteousness, for
   their acceptation, which the Lord Jesus has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> wrought out and provided
   for them; this being discovered to them, they approve of it with all
   their hearts, and rest in it. <reference osisRef="Isa.45.24">Isaiah 45:24</reference>, "Surely, shall one say, in
   the Lord have I righteousness and strength." This is their voice and
   language, when once the righteousness of God in Christ is made known
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them: "Here is righteousness indeed; here have I rest for my soul.
   Like the merchant man in the gospel (<reference osisRef="Matt.13.45-Matt.13.46">Matthew 13:45-46</reference>) that finds the
   pearl of price, I had been searching up and down; I looked this and
   that way for help, but it was far away; I spent my strength for that
   which was not bread: here is that, indeed, which makes me rich for
   ever!" When first the righteousness of Christ, for acceptation with
   God, is revealed to a poor labouring soul, that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> fought for rest
   and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> found none, he is surprised and amazed, and is not able to
   contain himself: and such a one always in his heart approves this
   righteousness on a twofold account: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] As full of infinite wisdom. "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that believe," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the
   apostle, "Christ crucified is the wisdom of God,'?" <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.24">1 Corinthians 1:24</reference> They
   see infinite wisdom in this way of their acceptation with God. "In what
   darkness," says such a one, "in what straits, in what entanglements,
   was my poor soul! How little able was I to look through the clouds and
   perplexities with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> I was encompassed! I looked inwards, and there
   was nothing but sin, horror, fear, tremblings; I looked upwards, and
   saw nothing but wrath, curses, and vengeance. I knew that God was a
   holy and righteous God, and that no unclean thing could abide before
   him; I knew that I was a poor, vile, unclean, and sinful creature; and
   how to bring these two together in peace, I knew not. But in the
   righteousness of Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> a world of wisdom open itself, dispelling
   all difficulties and darkness, and manifesting a reconciliation of all
   this." "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
   God!" <reference osisRef="Rom.11.33">Romans 11:33</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference> But of this before.
				</p><p>
   [2.] As full of grace. He knows that sin had shut up the whole way of
   grace towards him; and whereas God aims at nothing so much as the
   manifestation of his grace, he was utterly cut short of it. Now, to
   have a complete righteousness provided, and yet abundance of grace
   manifested, exceedingly delights the soul; -- to have God's dealing
   with his person all grace, and dealing with his righteousness all
   justice, takes up his thoughts. God everywhere assures us that this
   righteousness is of grace. It is "by grace, and no more of works," <reference osisRef="Rom.11.6">Romans 11:6</reference>, as the apostle at large sets it out, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.7-Eph.2.9">Ephesians 2:7-9</reference> It is from
   riches of grace and kindness that the provision of this righteousness
   is made. It is of mere grace that it is bestowed on us, it is not at
   all of works; though it be in itself a righteousness of works, yet to
   us it is of mere grace. So <reference osisRef="Titus.3.4-Titus.3.7">Titus 3:4-7</reference>, "But after that the kindness
   and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of
   righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
   us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost,
   which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that
   being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the
   hope of eternal life." The rise of all this dispensation is kindness
   and love; that is, grace, verse 4. The way of communication,
   negatively, is not by works of righteousness that we have done; --
   positively, by the communication of the Holy Ghost, verse 5; the means
   of whose procurement is Jesus Christ, verse 6; -- and the work itself
   is by grace, verse 7. Here is use made of every word almost, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   the exceeding rich grace, kindness, mercy, and goodness of God may be
   expressed, all concurring in this work. As: 1. Chrestotes, -- his
   goodness, benignity, readiness to communicate of himself and his good
   things that may be profitable to us. 2. Philanthropia, -- mercy, love,
   and propensity of mind to help, assist, relieve them of whom he speaks,
   towards whom he is so affected. 3. Eleos, -- mercy forgiveness,
   compassion, tenderness, to them that suffer; and charis, -- free
   pardoning bounty, undeserved love. And all this is said to be tou Theou
   soteros, -- he exercises all these properties and attributes of his
   nature towards us that he may save us; and in the bestowing of it,
   giving us the Holy Ghost, it is said, execheen, -- he poured him out as
   water out of a vessel, without stop and hesitation; and that not in a
   small measure, but plousios, -- richly and in abundance: from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>, as to
   the work itself, it is emphatically said, dikaiothentes te ekeinou
   chariti, -- justified by the grace of him who is such a one. And this
   do the saints of God, in their communion with Christ, exceedingly
   rejoice in before him, that the way of their acceptation before God is
   a way of grace, kindness, and mercy, that they might not boast in
   themselves, but in the Lord and his goodness, crying, "How great is your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   goodness! how great is your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> bounty!"
				</p><p>
   (4.) They approve of it, and rejoice in it, as a way of great peace and
   security to themselves and their own souls. They remember what was
   their state and condition while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> they went about to set up a
   righteousness of their own, and were not subject to the righteousness
   of Christ, -- how miserably they were tossed up and down with continual
   fluctuating thoughts. Sometimes they had hope, and sometimes were full
   of fear; sometimes they thought themselves in some good condition, and
   anon were at the very brink of hell, their consciences being racked and
   torn with sin and fear: but now, "being justified by faith, they have
   peace with God," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.1">Romans 5:1</reference> All is quiet and serene; not only that
   storm is over, but they are in the haven where they would be. They have
   abiding peace with God. Hence is that description of Christ to a poor
   soul, <reference osisRef="Isa.32.2">Isaiah 32:2</reference>, "And a man shall he as a hiding-place from the
   wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place,
   as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land." Wind and tempest, and
   drought and weariness, -- nothing now troubles the soul that is in
   Christ; he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a hiding-place, and a covert, and rivers of water, and
   the shadow of a great rock, for his security. This is the great mystery
   of faith in this business of our acceptation with God by Christ:  that
   whereas the soul of a believer finds enough in him and upon him to rend
   the very caul of the heart, to fill him with fears, terror,
   disquietments all his days, yet through Christ he is at perfect peace
   with God, <reference osisRef="Isa.26.3">Isaiah 26:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.4.6-Ps.4.8">Psalms 4:6-8</reference> Hence do the souls of believers
   exceedingly magnify Jesus Christ, that they can behold the face of God
   with boldness, confidence, peace, joy, assurance, -- that they can call
   him Father, bear themselves on his love, walk up and down in quietness,
   and without fear. How glorious is the Son of God in this grace! They
   remember the wormwood and gall that they have eaten; -- the vinegar and
   tears they have drunk; -- the trembling of their souls, like an aspen
   leaf that is shaken with the wind. Whenever they thought of God, what
   contrivances have they had to hide, and fly, and escape! To be brought
   now to settlement and security, must needs greatly affect them.
				</p><p>
   (5.) They cordially approve of this righteousness, because it is a way
   and means of exceeding exaltation and honour of the Lord Jesus, whom
   their souls do love. Being once brought to an acquaintance with Jesus
   Christ, their hearts desire nothing more than that he may be honoured
   and glorified to the utmost, and in all things have the pre-eminence.
   Now, what can more tend to the advancing and honouring of him in our
   hearts, than to know that he is made of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us "wisdom and
   righteousness?" <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference> Not that he is this or that part of our
   acceptation with God; but he is all, -- he is the whole. They know that
   on the account of his working out their acceptation with God, he is, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] Honoured of God his Father. <reference osisRef="Phil.2.7-Phil.2.11">Philippians 2:7-11</reference>, "He made himself of no
   reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in
   the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
   himself, and became obedient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death, even the death of the cross.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> God also has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> highly exalted him, and given him a name which
   is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
   of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
   and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
   glory of God the Father." Whether that word "therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>" denotes a
   connection of causality or only a consequence, this is evident, that on
   the account of his suffering, and as the end of it, he was [322]
   honoured and exalted of God to an unspeakable pre-eminence, dignity,
   and authority; according as God had promised him on the same account,
   <reference osisRef="Isa.53.11-Isa.53.12">Isaiah 53:11-12</reference>; <reference osisRef="Acts.2.36">Acts 2:36</reference>, v. 30, 31. And therefore it is said,
   that when "he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down at the right
   hand of the Majesty on high," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   [2.] He is on this account honoured of all the angels in heaven, even
   because of this great work of bringing sinners to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God; for they do
   not only bow down and desire to look into the mystery of the cross, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference>, but worship and praise him always on this account: <reference osisRef="Rev.5.11-Rev.5.14">Revelation of John 5:11-14</reference>, "I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and
   the living creatures and the elders: and the number of them was ten
   thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a
   loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and
   riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
   And every creature which is in heaven and earth, and under the earth,
   and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
   Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note>
   upon the throne, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb for ever and ever. And the living
   creatures said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and
   worshipped him that lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note> for ever and ever." The reason given of this
   glorious and wonderful doxology, this attribution of honour and glory
   to Jesus Christ by the whole host of heaven, is, because he was the
   Lamb that was slain; that is, because of the work of our redemption and
   our bringing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. And it is not a little refreshment and rejoicing
   to the souls of the saints, to know that all the angels of God, the
   whole host of heaven, which never sinned, do yet continually rejoice
   and ascribe praise and honour to the Lord Jesus, for his bringing them
   to peace and favour with God.
				</p><p>
   [3.] He is honoured by his saints all the world over; and indeed, if
   they do not, who should? If they honour him not as they honour the
   Father, they are, of all men, the most unworthy. But see what they do,
   <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5-Rev.1.6">Revelation of John 1:5-6</reference>, "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
   his own blood, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made us kings and priests to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God and his
   Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen." Chap. v.
   8-10, "The four living creatures and four and twenty elders fell down
   before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full
   of odours, which are the prayers of saints. And they sung a new song,
   saying, You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> worthy to take the book, and to open the seals
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>: for you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> were<note n="wast">Auto-modernized</note> slain, and have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> redeemed us to God by your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> blood,
   out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> made
   us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."
   The great, solemn worship of the Christian church consists in this
   assignation of honour and glory to the Lord Jesus: therefore do they
   love him, honour him, delight in him; as Paul, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8">Philippians 3:8</reference>; and so the
   spouse, <reference osisRef="Song.5.9-Song.5.16">Song of Solomon 5:9-16</reference> And this is on this account, --
				</p><p>
   (6.) They cordially approve of this righteousness, this way of
   acceptation, as that which brings glory to God as such. When they were
   labouring under the guilt of sin, that which did most of all perplex
   their souls was, that their safety was inconsistent with the glory and
   honour of the great God, -- [323] with his justice, faithfulness, and
   truth, all which were engaged for the destruction of sin; and how to
   come off from ruin without the loss of their honour [i. e., the honour
   of the fore-mentioned attributes] they saw not. But now by the
   revelation of this righteousness from faith to faith, they plainly see
   that all the properties of God are exceedingly glorified in the pardon,
   justification, and acceptance of poor sinners; as before was
   manifested.
				</p><p>
   And this is the first way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the saints hold daily communion with
   the Lord Jesus in this purchased grace of acceptation with God: they
   consider, approve of, and rejoice in, the way, means, and thing itself.
				</p><p>
   2. They make an actual commutation with the Lord Jesus as to their sins
   and his righteousness. Of this there are also sundry parts: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) They continually keep alive upon their hearts a sense of the guilt
   and evil of sin; even then when they are under some comfortable
   persuasions of their personal acceptance with God. Sense of pardon
   takes away the horror and fear, but not a due sense of the guilt of
   sin. It is the daily exercise of the saints of God, to consider the
   great provocation that is in sin, -- their sins, the sin of their
   nature and lives; to render themselves vile in their own hearts and
   thoughts on that account; to compare it with the terror of the Lord;
   and to judge themselves continually. This they do in general. "My sin
   is ever before me," says David. They set sin before them, not to
   terrify and affright their souls with it, but that a due sense of the
   evil of it may be kept alive upon their hearts.
				</p><p>
   (2.) They gather up in their thoughts the sins for which they have not
   made a particular reckoning with God in Christ; or if they have begun
   so to do, yet they have not made clear work of it, nor come to a clear
   and comfortable issue. There is nothing more dreadful than for a man to
   be able to digest his convictions; -- to have sin look him in the face,
   and speak perhaps some words of terror to him, and to be able, by any
   charms of diversions or delays, to put it off, without coming to a full
   trial as to state and condition in reference to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. This the saints
   do:  they gather up their sins, lay them in the balance of the law,
   see and consider their weight and desert; and then, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) They make this commutation I speak of with Jesus Christ; that is,
   --
				</p><p>
   [1.] They seriously consider, and by faith conquer, all objections to
   the contrary, that Jesus Christ, by the will and appointment of the
   Father, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> really undergone the punishment that was due to those sins
   that lie now under his eye and consideration, <reference osisRef="Isa.53.6">Isaiah 53:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference> He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> as certainly and really answered the justice of God for
   them as, if he himself (the sinner) should at that instant be cast into
   hell, he could do.
				</p><p>
   [2.] They hearken to the voice of Christ calling them to him with their
   burden, "Come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden;" -- "Come
   with your burdens; come, you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> poor soul, with your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> guilt of sin." Why?
   what to do? "Why, this is mine," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Christ; "this agreement I made
   with my Father, that I should come, and take your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> sins, and bear them
   away: they were my lot. Give me your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> burden, give me all your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> sins. You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note>
   know<note n="knowest">Auto-modernized</note> not what to do with them; I know how to dispose of them well
   enough, so that God shall be glorified, and your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> soul delivered."
   Hereupon, --
				</p><p>
   [3.] They lay down their sins at the cross of Christ, upon his
   shoulders. This is faith's great and bold venture upon the grace,
   faithfulness, and truth of God, to stand by the cross and say, "Ah! he
   is bruised for my sins, and wounded for my transgressions, and the
   chastisement of my peace is upon him. He is thus made sin for me. Here
   I give up my sins to him that is able to bear them, to undergo them. He
   requires it of my hands, that I should be content that he should
   undertake for them; and that I heartily consent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>." This is every
   day's work; I know not how any peace can be maintained with God without
   it. If it be the work of souls to receive Christ, as made sin for us,
   we must receive him as one that takes our sins upon him. Not as though
   he died any more, or suffered any more; but as the faith of the saints
   of old made that present and done before their eyes [which had] not yet
   come to pass, <reference osisRef="Heb.11.1">Hebrews 11:1</reference>, so faith now makes that present which was
   accomplished and past many generations ago. This it is to know Christ
   crucified.
				</p><p>
   [4.] Having thus by faith given up their sins to Christ, and seen God
   laying them all on him, they draw nigh, and take from him that
   righteousness which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> wrought out for them; so fulfilling the
   whole of that of the apostle, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>, "He was made sin for us,
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." They consider
   him tendering himself and his righteousness, to be their righteousness
   before God; they take it, and accept of it, and complete this blessed
   bartering and exchange of faith. Anger, curse, wrath, death, sin as to
   its guilt, he took it all and takes it all away. With him we leave
   whatever of this nature belongs to us; and from him we receive love,
   life, righteousness, and peace.
				</p><p>
   Objection. But it may be said, "Surely this course of procedure can
   never be acceptable to Jesus Christ. What! shall we daily come to him
   with our filth, our guilt, our sins? May he not, will he not, bid us
   keep them to ourselves? they are our own. Shall we be always giving
   sins, and taking righteousness?"
				</p><p>
   Answer. There is not any thing that Jesus Christ is more delighted
   with, than that his saints should always hold communion with him as to
   this business of giving and receiving. For, --
				</p><p>
   1. This exceedingly honours him, and gives him the glory that is his
   due. Many, indeed, cry "Lord, Lord," and make mention of him, but
   honour him not at all. How so? They take his work out of his hands, and
   ascribe it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> other things; their repentance, their duties, shall
   bear their iniquities. They do not say so; but they do so. The
   commutation they make, if they make any, it is with themselves. All
   their bartering about sin is in and with their own souls. The work that
   Christ came to do in the world, was to "bear our iniquities," and lay
   down his life a ransom for our sins. The cup he had to drink of was
   filled with our sins, as to the punishment due to them. What greater
   dishonour, then, can be done to the Lord Jesus, than to ascribe this
   work to any thing else, -- to think to get rid of our sins [by] any
   other way or means? In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, then, I say, is Christ honoured indeed,
   when we go to him with our sins by faith, and say to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, "Lord, this
   is your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> work; this is that for which you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> camest into the world; this is
   that you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note> undertaken to do. You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> callest for my burden, which is
   too heavy for me to bear; take it, blessed Redeemer. You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> tenderest your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   righteousness; that is my portion." Then is Christ honoured, then is
   the glory of mediation ascribed to him, when we walk with him in this
   communion.
				</p><p>
   2. This exceedingly endears the souls of the saints to him, and
   constrains them to put a due valuation upon him, his love, his
   righteousness, and grace. When they find, and have the daily use of it,
   then they do it. Who would not love him? "I have been with the Lord
   Jesus," may the poor soul say: "I have left my sins, my burden, with
   him; and he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given me his righteousness, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> I am going with
   boldness to God. I was dead, and am alive; for he died for me: I was
   cursed, and am blessed; for he was made a curse for me: I was troubled,
   but have peace; for the chastisement of my peace was upon him. I knew
   not what to do, nor whither to cause my sorrow to go; by him have I
   received joy unspeakable and glorious. If I do not love him, delight in
   him, obey him, live to him, die for him, I am worse than the devils in
   hell." Now the great aim of Christ in the world is, to have a high
   place and esteem in the hearts of his people; to have there, as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   in himself, the pre-eminence in all things, -- not to be jostled up and
   down among other things, -- to be all, and in all. And thus are the
   saints of God prepared to esteem him, upon the engaging themselves to
   this communion with him.
				</p><p>
   Obj. Yea, but you will say, "If this be so, what need we to repent or
   amend our ways? it is but going to Christ by faith, making this
   exchange with him: and so we may sin, that grace may abound."
				</p><p>
   Ans. I judge no man's person; but this I must needs say, that I do not
   understand how a man that makes this objection in cold blood, not under
   a temptation or accidental darkness, can have any true or real
   acquaintance with Jesus Christ: however, this I am certain of, that
   this communion in itself produces quite other effects than those
   supposed. For, --
				</p><p>
   1. For repentance; it is, I suppose, a gospel repentance that is
   intended. For a legal, bondage repentance, full of dread, amazement,
   terror, self-love, astonishment at the presence of God, I confess this
   communion takes it away, prevents it, casts it out, with its bondage
   and fear; but for gospel repentance, whose nature consists in godly
   sorrow for sin, with its relinquishing<note n="relinquishment">Auto-modernized</note>, proceeding from faith, love,
   and abhorrence of sin, on accounts of Father, Son, and Spirit, both law
   and love, -- that this should be hindered by this communion, is not
   possible. I told you that the foundation of this communion is laid in a
   deep, serious, daily consideration of sin, its guilt, vileness, and
   abomination, and our own vileness on that account; that a sense of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   is to be kept alive in and upon the heart of every one that will enjoy
   this communion with Christ: without it Christ is of no value nor esteem
   to him. Now, is it possible that a man should daily fill his heart with
   the thoughts of the vileness of sin, on all considerations whatever, --
   of law, love, grace, gospel, life, and death, -- and be filled with
   self-abhorrency on this account, and yet be a stranger to godly sorrow?
   Here is the mistake, -- the foundation of this communion is laid in
   that which they suppose it overthrows.
				</p><p>
   2. But what shall we say for obedience? "If Christ be so glorified and
   honoured by taking our sins, the more we bring to him, the more will he
   be glorified." A man could not suppose that this objection would be
   made, but that the Holy Ghost, who knows what is in man and his heart,
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made it for them, and in their name, <reference osisRef="Rom.6.1-Rom.6.3">Romans 6:1-3</reference> The very same
   doctrine that I have insisted on being delivered, chap. v. 18-20, the
   same objection is made to it: and for those who think it may have any
   weight, I refer them to the answer given in that chapter by the
   apostle; as also to what was said before to the necessity of our
   obedience, notwithstanding the imputation of the righteousness of
   Christ.
				</p><p>
   But you will say, "How should we address ourselves to the performance
   of this duty? what path are we to walk in?"
				</p><p>
   Faith exercises itself in it, especially three ways: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) In meditation. The heart goes over, in its own thoughts, the part
   above insisted on, sometimes severally, sometimes jointly, sometimes
   fixing primarily on one thing, sometimes on another, and sometimes
   going over the whole. At one time, perhaps, the soul is most upon
   consideration of its own sinfulness, and filling itself with shame and
   self-abhorrency on that account; sometimes it is filled with the
   thoughts of the righteousness of Christ, and with joy unspeakable and
   glorious on that account. Especially on great occasions, when grieved
   and burdened by negligence, or eruption of corruption, then the soul
   goes over the whole work, and so drives things to an issue with God,
   and takes up the peace that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> wrought out for him.
				</p><p>
   (2.) In considering and inquiring into the promises of the gospel,
   which hold out all these things:  the excellency, fulness, and
   suitableness of the righteousness of Christ, the rejection of all false
   righteousness, and the commutation made in the love of God; which was
   formerly insisted on.
				</p><p>
   (3.) In prayer. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> do their souls go through this work day by day;
   and this communion have all the saints with the Lord Jesus, as to their
   acceptation with God: which was the first thing proposed to
   consideration.

<title>Part 2 Chapter 9</title>
<p>
   Of communion with Christ in holiness -- The several acts ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the Lord Christ in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>: 1. His intercession; 2. Sending of the Spirit;
   3. Bestows habitual grace -- What that is, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it consists --
   This purchased by Christ; bestowed by him -- Of actual grace -- How the
   saints hold communion with Christ in these things; manifested in sundry
   particulars.
				</p><p>
   II. Our communion with the Lord Jesus as to that grace of
   sanctification and purification of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we have made mention, in the
   several distinctions and degrees of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, formerly, is nextly to be
   considered. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the former method must be observed; and we must
   show, -- 1. What are the peculiar actings of the Lord Christ as to this
   communion; and, 2. What is the duty of the saints in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>. The sum is,
   -- How we hold communion with Christ in holiness, as well as in
   righteousness; and that very briefly: 
				</p><p>
   1. There are several acts ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Jesus in reference to
   this particular; as, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) His interceding with the Father, by virtue of his oblation in the
   behalf of his, that he would bestow the Holy Spirit on them. Here I
   choose to enter, because of the oblation of Christ itself I have spoken
   before; otherwise, every thing is to be run up to that head, that
   source and spring. There lies the foundation of all spiritual mercies
   whatever; as afterward also shall be manifested. Now the Spirit, as
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a Spirit of grace, holiness, and consolation, is of the
   purchase of Christ. It is upon the matter, the great promise of the new
   covenant, <reference osisRef="Ezek.11.19">Ezekiel 11:19</reference>, "I will put a new spirit within you;" so also,
   chap. xxxvi. 27; <reference osisRef="Jer.32.39-Jer.32.40">Jeremiah 32:39-40</reference>; and in sundry other places,
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> afterward. Christ is the mediator and "surety of this new
   covenant." <reference osisRef="Heb.7.22">Hebrews 7:22</reference>, "Jesus was made surety of a better testament,"
   or rather covenant; -- a testament needs no surety. He is the
   undertaker on the part of God and man also: of man, to give
   satisfaction; of God, to bestow the whole grace of the promise; as
   chap. ix. 15, "For this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
   that by means of death, for the redemption of transgressions that were
   under the first testament, they which are called might receive the
   promise of eternal inheritance." He both satisfied for sin and procured
   the promise. He procures all the love and kindness which are the fruits
   of the covenant, being himself the original promise of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</reference>; the whole being so "ordered in all things, and made sure," <reference osisRef="2Sam.23.5">2 Samuel 23:5</reference>, that the residue of its effects should all be derived from
   him, depend upon him, and be procured by him, -- "that he in all things
   might have the pre-eminence," <reference osisRef="Col.1.18">Colossians 1:18</reference>; according to the compact and
   agreement made with him, <reference osisRef="Isa.53.12">Isaiah 53:12</reference> They are all the purchase of
   his blood; and therefore the Spirit also, as promised in that covenant,
   <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.30">1 Corinthians 1:30</reference> Now, the whole fruit and purchase of his death is made
   out from the Father upon his intercession. This (<reference osisRef="John.14.16-John.14.18">John 14:16-18</reference>) he
   promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples, that he will pursue the work which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in
   hand in their behalf, and intercede with the Father for the Spirit, as
   a fruit of his purchase. Therefore he tells them that he will not pray
   the Father for his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, because the eternal love of the
   Father is not the fruit but the fountain of his purchase: but the
   Spirit, that is a fruit; "That," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "I will pray the Father
   for," etc. And what Christ asks<note n="asketh">Auto-modernized</note> the Father as mediator to bestow on
   us, that is part of his purchase, [324] being promised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, upon
   his undertaking to do the will of God. And this is the first thing that
   is to be considered in the Lord Jesus, as to the communication of the
   Spirit of sanctification and purification, the first thing to be
   considered in this our communion with him, -- he intercedes with his
   Father, that he may be bestowed on us as a fruit of his death and blood
   shed in our behalf. This is the relation of the Spirit of holiness, as
   bestowed on us, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the mediation of Christ. He is the great [325]
   foundation of the covenant of grace; being himself everlastingly
   destinated and freely given to make a purchase of all the good things
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Receiving, according to promise, the Holy Ghost, <reference osisRef="Acts.2.33">Acts 2:33</reference>,
   he sheds him abroad on his own. This faith considers, fixes on, dwells
   upon. For, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) His prayer being granted, as the [326] Father "hears him always,"
   he actually sends his Spirit into the hearts of his saints, there to
   dwell in his stead, and to do all things for them and in them which he
   himself has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to do. This, secondly, is the Lord Christ by faith to be
   eyed in; and that not only in respect of the first enduing of our
   hearts with his Holy Spirit, but also of the continual supplies of it,
   drawing forth and exciting more effectual [327] operations and actings
   of that indwelling Spirit. Hence, though (<reference osisRef="John.14.16">John 14:16</reference>) he says the
   Father will give them the Comforter, because the original and sovereign
   dispensation is in his hand, and it is by him made out, upon the
   intercession of Christ; yet, not being bestowed immediately on us, but,
   as it were, given into the hand of Christ for us, he affirms that (as
   to actual collation or bestowing) he sends him himself; chap. xv. 26,
   "I will send the Comforter to you, from the Father." He receives him
   from his Father, and actually sends him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his saints. So, chap. xvi.
   7, "I will send him." And, verses 14, 15, he manifests how he will send
   him. He will furnish him with that which is his to bestow upon them:
   "He shall take of mine (of that which is properly and peculiarly so, --
   mine, as mediator, -- the fruit of my life and death to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> holiness),
   and give it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you." But of these things more afterward. This, then,
   is the second thing that the Lord Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, and which is to be eyed
   in him:  He sends his Holy Spirit into our hearts; which is the [328]
   efficient cause of all holiness and sanctification, -- quickening,
   enlightening, purifying the souls of his saints. How our union with
   him, with all the benefit upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> depending, flows<note n="floweth">Auto-modernized</note> from this his
   communication of the Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, to abide with us, and to dwell in
   us, I have at large [329] elsewhere declared; where also this whole
   matter is more fully opened. And this is to be considered in him by
   faith, in reference to the Spirit itself.
				</p><p>
   (3.) There is that which we call habitual grace; that is, the fruits of
   the Spirit, -- the spirit which is born of the Spirit, <reference osisRef="John.3.6">John 3:6</reference>
   That which is born of, or produced by, the Holy Ghost, in the heart or
   soul of a man when he is regenerate, that which makes him so, is
   spirit; in opposition to [330] the flesh, or that enmity which is in us
   by nature against God. It is faith, love, joy, hope, and the rest of
   the graces of the gospel, in their root or common principle, concerning
   which these two things are to be observed: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] That though many particular graces are mentioned, yet there are
   not different habits or qualities in us, -- not several or distinct
   principles to answer them; but only the same [331] habit or spiritual
   principle putting forth itself in various operations or ways of
   working, according to the variety of the objects which it goes forth
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, is their common principle: so that it is called and
   distinguished, as above, rather in respect of actual exercise, with
   relation to its objects, than habitual inherence; it being one root
   which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> these many branches.
				</p><p>
   [2.] This is that which I intend by this habit of grace, -- a [332]
   new, gracious, spiritual [333] life, or principle, [334] created, and
   [335] bestowed on the soul, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it is [336] changed in all its
   faculties and affections, fitted and enabled to go forth in the way of
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every divine object that is proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, according
   to the mind of God. For instance, the mind can discern of [337]
   spiritual things in a spiritual manner; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> it is light,
   illumination. The whole soul closes with Christ, as held forth in the
   promises of the gospel for righteousness and salvation: that is faith;
   which being the main and principal work of it, it often gives
   denomination to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole. So when it rests in God, in Christ, with
   delight, desire, and complacency, it is called love; being, indeed, the
   principle suiting all the faculties of our souls for spiritual and
   living operations, according to their natural use. Now it differs, --
				</p><p>
   1st. From the Spirit dwelling in the saints; for it is a created
   quality. The Spirit dwells in us as a free agent in a holy habitation.
   This grace, as a quality, remains in us, as in its own proper subject,
   that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not any subsistence but in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, and is capable of being
   intended [338] or restrained under great variety of degrees.
				</p><p>
   2dly. From actual grace, which is transient; this making its residence
   in the soul. [339] Actual grace is an illapse of divine influence and
   assistance, working in and by the soul any spiritual act or duty
   whatsoever, without any pre-existence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that act or continuance
   after it, "God working in us, both to will and to do." But this
   habitual grace is always resident in us, causing the soul to be a meet
   principle for all those holy and spiritual operations which by actual
   grace are to be performed. And, --
				</p><p>
   3dly. It is capable of augmentation and diminution, as was said. In
   some it is more large and more effectual than in others; yea, in some
   persons, more at one time than another. Hence are those [340] dyings,
   decays, ruins, recoveries, complaints, and rejoicings, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> so
   frequent mention is made in the Scripture.
				</p><p>
   These things being premised as to the nature of it, let us now consider
   what we are to eye in the Lord Jesus in reference to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, to make an
   entrance into our communion with him in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, as things by him or on
   his part performed: 
				</p><p>
   As I said of the Spirit, so, in the first place, I say of this, it is
   of the purchase of Christ, and is so to be looked on. "It is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us for [341] his sake to believe on him," <reference osisRef="Phil.1.29">Philippians 1:29</reference> The Lord, on the
   behalf of Christ, for his sake, because it is purchased and procured by
   him for us, bestows faith, and (by same rule) all grace upon us. "We
   are blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in him,"
   <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3">Ephesians 1:3</reference> "In him;" [342] that is, in and through his mediation for
   us. His oblation and intercession lie at the bottom of this
   dispensation. Were not grace by them procured, it would never by any
   one soul be enjoyed. All grace is from this fountain. In our receiving
   it from Christ, we must still consider what it [343] cost him. Want of
   this weakens faith in its proper workings. His whole intercession is
   founded on his oblation, <reference osisRef="1John.2.1-1John.2.2">1 John 2:1-2</reference> What he purchased by his
   death, that -- nor more nor less, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been often said -- he
   intercedes<note n="intercedeth">Auto-modernized</note> may be bestowed. And he prays that all his saints may have
   this grace of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak, <reference osisRef="John.17.17">John 17:17</reference> Did we continually consider
   all grace as the fruit of the purchase of Christ, it would be an
   exceeding endearment on our spirits: nor can we without this
   consideration, according to the tenor of the gospel, ask or expect any
   grace. It is no prejudice to the free grace of the Father, to look on
   any thing as the purchase of the Son; it was from that grace that he
   made that purchase: and in the receiving of grace from God, we have not
   communion with Christ, who is yet the treasury and storehouse of it,
   unless we look upon it as his purchase. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> obtained that we should
   be [344] sanctified throughout, have life in us, be humble, holy,
   believing, dividing the spoil with the mighty, by destroying the works
   of the devil in us.
				</p><p>
   Secondly. The Lord Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> actually communicate this grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   saints, and bestows it on them: "Of his fulness have all we received,
   and grace for grace," <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference> For, --
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The Father actually invests him with all the grace of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>, by
   compact and agreement, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made a purchase (as he received the
   promise of the Spirit); which is all that is of use for the bringing
   his many sons to glory. "It pleased the Father that in him should all
   fulness dwell," <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference>, -- that he should be invested with a
   fulness of that grace which is needful for his people. This himself
   calls the "power of giving eternal life to his elect," <reference osisRef="John.17.2">John 17:2</reference>;
   which power is not only his ability to do it, but also his right to do
   it. Hence this delivering of all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by his Father, he lays
   as the bottom of his inviting sinners to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for refreshment: "All
   things are delivered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me of my Father," <reference osisRef="Matt.11.27">Matthew 11:27</reference> "Come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   me, all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,"
   verse 28. This being the covenant of the Father with him, and his
   promise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, that upon the making "his soul an offering for sin,
   he should see his seed, and the pleasure of the Lord should prosper in
   his hand," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.10">Isaiah 53:10</reference>, in the verses following, the "pouring out of
   his soul to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death, and bearing the sins of many," is laid as the
   bottom and procuring cause of these things:  1. Of justification: "By
   his knowledge he shall justify many." 2. Of sanctification; in
   "destroying the works of the devil," verses 11, 12. Thus comes our
   merciful high priest to be the great possessor of all grace, that he
   may give out to us according to his own pleasure, quickening whom he
   will. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it in him really as our head, in that he received not
   that Spirit by measure (<reference osisRef="John.3.34">John 3:34</reference>) which is the bond of union
   between him and us, <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.17">1 Corinthians 6:17</reference>; through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> holding him, the head, we
   are filled with his fulness, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.22-Eph.1.23">Ephesians 1:22-23</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference> He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it as
   a common person, intrusted with it in our behalf, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.14-Rom.5.17">Romans 5:14-17</reference> "The
   last Adam is made" to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us "a quickening Spirit," <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.45">1 Corinthians 15:45</reference> He is
   also a treasury of this grace in a moral and law sense: not only as "it
   pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell," <reference osisRef="Col.1.19">Colossians 1:19</reference>;
   but also because in his mediation, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been declared, is founded
   the whole dispensation of grace.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) Being thus actually vested with this power, and privilege, and
   fulness, he designs the Spirit to take of this fulness, and to give it
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us: "He shall take of mine, and shall show it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you," <reference osisRef="John.16.15">John 16:15</reference> The Spirit takes of that fulness that is in Christ, and in the name
   of the Lord Jesus bestows it actually on them for whose sanctification
   he is sent. Concerning the manner and almighty efficacy of the Spirit
   of grace through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> this is done (I mean this actual collation of grace
   upon his peculiar ones), more will be spoken afterward.
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) For actual grace, or that influence or power through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the saints
   are enabled to perform particular duties according to the mind of God,
   there is not any need of farther enlargement about it. What concerns
   our communion with the Lord Christ in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, holds proportion with what
   was spoken before.
				</p><p>
   There remains<note n="remaineth">Auto-modernized</note> only one thing more to be observed concerning those
   things of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> mention has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been made, and I proceed to the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   we carry on communion with the Lord Jesus in all these; and that is,
   that these things may be considered two ways:  1. In respect of their
   first collation, or bestowing on the soul. 2. In respect of their
   continuance and increase, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the degrees of them.
				</p><p>
   In the first sense, as to the real communicating of the Spirit of grace
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the soul, so raising it from death to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> life, the saints have no
   kind of communion with Christ in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> but only what consists in a
   passive reception of that life-giving, quickening Spirit and power.
   They are but as the dead bones in the prophet; the wind blows on them,
   and they live; -- as Lazarus in the grave; Christ calls, and they come
   forth, the call being accompanied with life and power. This, then, is
   not that of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> particularly I speak; but it is the second, in respect
   of farther efficacy of the Spirit and increase of grace, both habitual
   and actual, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we become more holy, and to be more powerful in
   walking with God, -- have more fruit in obedience and success against
   temptations. And in this, --
				</p><p>
   2. They hold communion with the Lord Christ. And in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> and how they
   do it, shall now be declared.
				</p><p>
   They continually eye the Lord Jesus as the great Joseph, that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the
   disposal of all the granaries of the kingdom of heaven committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him; as one in whom it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> pleased the Father to gather all things
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a head, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference>, that from him all things might be dispensed
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. All treasures, all fulness, the Spirit not by measure, are
   in him. And this fulness in this Joseph, in reference to their
   condition, they eye in these three particulars: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) In the preparation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the dispensation mentioned, in the
   expiating, purging, purifying efficacy of his blood. It was a sacrifice
   not only of atonement, as offered, but also of purification, as poured
   out. This the apostle eminently sets forth, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.13-Heb.9.14">Hebrews 9:13-14</reference>, "For if
   the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling
   the unclean, sanctifies<note n="sanctifieth">Auto-modernized</note> to the purifying of the flesh: how much more
   shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered
   himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to
   serve the living God?" This blood of his is that which answers all
   typical institutions for carnal purification; and therefore has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a
   spiritually-purifying, cleansing, sanctifying virtue in itself, as
   offered and poured out. Hence it is called, "A fountain for sin and for
   uncleanness," <reference osisRef="Zech.13.1">Zechariah 13:1</reference>; that is, for their washing and taking
   away; -- "A fountain opened;" ready prepared, virtuous, efficacious in
   itself, before any be put into it; because poured out, instituted,
   appointed to that purpose. The saints see that in themselves they are
   still exceedingly defiled; and, indeed, to have a sight of the
   defilements of sin is a more spiritual discovery than to have only a
   sense of the guilt of sin. This follows every conviction, and is
   commensurate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it; that, usually only such as reveal the purity and
   holiness of God and all his ways. Hereupon they cry with shame, within
   themselves, "Unclean, unclean," -- unclean in their natures, unclean in
   their persons, unclean in their conversations; all rolled in the [345]
   blood of their defilements; their hearts by nature a very sink, and
   their lives a dung hill. They know, also, that no unclean thing shall
   enter into the kingdom of God, or have place in the new Jerusalem; that
   God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. They cannot endure to
   look on themselves; and how shall they dare to appear in his presence?
   What remedies shall they now use? "Though they wash themselves with
   nitre, and take them much soap, yet their iniquity will continue
   marked," <reference osisRef="Jer.2.22">Jeremiah 2:22</reference> With which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>, then, shall they come before the Lord?
   For the removal of this, I say, they look, in the first place, to the
   purifying virtue of the blood of Christ, which is able to cleanse them
   from all their sins, <reference osisRef="1John.1.7">1 John 1:7</reference>; being the spring from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> flows<note n="floweth">Auto-modernized</note>
   all the purifying virtue, which in the issue will take away all their
   spots and stains, "make them holy and without blemish, and in the end
   present them glorious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.26-Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:26-27</reference> This they dwell
   upon with thoughts of faith; they roll it in their minds and spirits.
   Here faith obtains new life, new vigour, when a sense of vileness has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   even overwhelmed it. Here is a fountain opened: draw nigh, and see its
   beauty, purity, and efficacy. Here is a foundation laid of that work
   whose accomplishment we long for. One moment's communion with Christ by
   faith in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is more effectual to the purging of the soul, to the
   increasing of grace, than the utmost self-endeavours of a thousand
   ages.
				</p><p>
   (2.) They eye the blood of Christ as the blood of sprinkling. Coming to
   "Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant," they come to the [346]
   "blood of sprinkling," <reference osisRef="Heb.12.24">Hebrews 12:24</reference> The eyeing of the blood of Christ
   as shed will not of itself take away pollution. There is not only
   haimatekchusia, -- a "shedding of blood," without which there is no
   remission, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.22">Hebrews 9:22</reference>; but there is also haimatos rhantismos, -- a
   "sprinkling of blood," without which there is no actual purification.
   This the apostle largely describes, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.19">Hebrews 9:19</reference>, "When Moses," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>
   he, "had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law,
   he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool,
   and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the people, saying,
   This is the blood of the testament which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> enjoined to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you.
   Moreover he sprinkled likewise with blood both the tabernacle, and all
   the vessels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law
   purged with blood. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of
   things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly
   things themselves with better sacrifices than these," verses 19-23. He
   had formerly compared the blood of Christ to the blood of sacrifices,
   as offered, in respect of the impetration and the purchase it made; now
   he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that blood as sprinkled, in respect of its application
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> purification and holiness. And he tells us how this sprinkling was
   performed: it was by dipping hyssop in the blood of the sacrifice, and
   so dashing it out upon the things and persons to be purified; as the
   institution also was with the paschal lamb, <reference osisRef="Exod.12.7">Exodus 12:7</reference> Hence, David,
   in a sense of the pollution of sin, prays that he may be "purged with
   hyssop," <reference osisRef="Ps.51.7">Psalms 51:7</reference> For that this peculiarly respected the uncleanness
   and defilement of sin, is evident, because there is no mention made, in
   the institution of any sacrifice (after that of the lamb before
   mentioned), of sprinkling blood with hyssop, but only in those which
   respected purification of uncleanness; as in the case of leprosy, <reference osisRef="Lev.14.6">Leviticus 14:6</reference>; and all other defilements, <reference osisRef="Num.19.18">Numbers 19:18</reference>: which latter, indeed,
   is not of blood, but of the water of separation; this also being
   eminently typical of the blood of Christ, which is the fountain for
   separation for uncleanness, <reference osisRef="Zech.13.1">Zechariah 13:1</reference> Now, this bunch of hyssop,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the blood of purification was prepared for the sprinkling of
   the unclean, is (to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us) the free promises of Christ. The cleansing
   virtue of the blood of Christ lies in the promises, as the blood of
   sacrifices in the hyssop, ready to pass out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that draw nigh
   to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Therefore the apostle argues<note n="argueth">Auto-modernized</note> from receiving of the promise
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> universal holiness and purity: "Having therefore these promises,
   dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the
   flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God," <reference osisRef="2Cor.7.1">2 Corinthians 7:1</reference> This, then, the saints do:  they eye the blood of Christ as it is
   in the promise, ready to issue out upon the soul, for the purification
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; and thence is purging and cleansing virtue to be communicated
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, and by the blood of Christ are they to be purged from all
   their sins, <reference osisRef="1John.1.7">1 John 1:7</reference> Thus far, as it were, this purifying blood,
   thus prepared and made ready, is at some distance to the soul. Though
   it be shed to this purpose, that it might purge, cleanse, and sanctify,
   though it be taken up with the bunch of hyssop in the promises, yet the
   soul may not partake of it. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) They look upon him as, in his own Spirit, he is the only dispenser
   of the Spirit and of all grace of sanctification and holiness. They
   consider that upon his intercession it is granted to him that he shall
   make effectual all the fruits of his purchase, to the sanctification,
   the purifying and making glorious in holiness, of his whole people.
   They know that this is actually to be accomplished by the Spirit,
   according to the innumerable promises given to that purpose. He is to
   sprinkle that blood upon their souls; he is to create the holiness in
   them that they long after; he is to be himself in them a well of water
   springing up to everlasting life. In this state they look to Jesus:
   here faith fixes itself, in expectation of his giving out the Spirit
   for all these ends and purposes; mixing the promises with faith, and so
   becoming actual partaker of all this grace. This is their way, this
   their communion with Christ; this is the life of faith, as to grace and
   holiness. Blessed is the soul that is exercised in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>: "He shall be
   as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads<note n="spreadeth">Auto-modernized</note> out her roots by
   the river, and shall not see when heat comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note>, but her leaf shall be
   green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall
   cease from yielding fruit," <reference osisRef="Jer.17.8">Jeremiah 17:8</reference> Convinced persons who know
   not Christ, nor the fellowship of his sufferings, would spin a holiness
   out of their own bowels; they would work it out in their own strength.
   They begin it with [347] trying endeavours; and follow it with vows,
   duties, resolutions, engagements, sweating at it all the day long. Thus
   they continue for a season, -- their hypocrisy, for the most part,
   ending in apostasy. The saints of God do, in the very entrance of their
   walking with him, reckon upon it that they have a threefold want: 
   [1.] Of the Spirit of holiness to dwell in them. [2.] Of a habit of
   holiness to be infused into them. [3.] Of actual assistance to work all
   their works for them; and that if these should continue to be wanting,
   they can never, with all their might, power, and endeavours, perform
   any one act of holiness before the Lord. They know that of themselves
   they have no sufficiency, -- that [348] without Christ they can do
   nothing: therefore they look to him, who is intrusted with a fulness of
   all these in their behalf; and thereupon by faith derive from him an
   increase of that of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> they stand in need. Thus, I say, have the
   saints communion with Christ, as to their sanctification and holiness.
   From him do they receive the Spirit to dwell in them; from him the new
   principle of life, which is the root of all their obedience; from him
   have they actual assistance for every duty they are called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. In
   waiting for, expectation and receiving of these blessings, on the
   accounts before mentioned, do they spend their lives and time with him.
   In vain is help looked for from other mountains; in vain do men spend
   their strength in following after righteousness, if this be wanting.
   Fix your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> soul here; you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt not tarry until you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> be ashamed. This is
   the way, the only way, to obtain full, effectual manifestations of the
   Spirit's dwelling in us; to have our hearts purified, our consciences
   purged, our sins mortified, our graces increased, our souls made
   humble, holy, zealous, believing, -- like to him; to have our lives
   fruitful, our deaths comfortable. Let us in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> abide, eyeing Christ by
   faith, to attain that measure of conformity to him which is allotted
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in this world, that when we shall see him as he is, we may be
   like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.

<title>Part 2 Chapter 10</title>
<p>
   Of communion with Christ in privileges -- Of adoption; the nature of
   it, the consequences of it -- Peculiar privileges attending it;
   liberty, title, boldness, affliction -- Communion with Christ hereby.
				</p><p>
   III. The third thing in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion with Christ, is grace of
   privilege before God; I mean, as the third head of purchased grace. The
   privileges we enjoy by Christ are great and innumerable; to insist on
   them in particular were work for a man's whole life, not a design to be
   wrapped up in a few sheets. I shall take a view of them only in the
   head, the spring and fountain from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they all arise and flow, -- this
   is our adoption: "Beloved, now are we the sons of God," <reference osisRef="1John.3.2">1 John 3:2</reference>
   This is our great and fountain privilege. From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is it that we are so?
   It is from the love of the Father. Verse 1, "Behold, what manner of
   love the Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
   sons of God!" But by whom immediately do we receive this honour? As
   many as believe on Christ, he gives them this power, to become the sons
   of God, <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference> Himself was appointed to be the first-born among
   many brethren, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.29">Romans 8:29</reference>; and his taking us to be brethren, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.11">Hebrews 2:11</reference>, makes us become the children of God. Now, that God is our
   Father, by being the Father of Christ, and we his children by being the
   brethren of Christ, being the head and sum of all the honour,
   privilege, right, and title we have, let us a little consider the
   nature of that act through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are invested with this state and title,
   -- namely, our adoption.
				</p><p>
   Now, adoption is the authoritative translation of a believer, by Jesus
   Christ, from the family of the world and Satan into the family of God,
   with his investiture in all the privileges and advantages of that
   family.
				</p><p>
   To the complete adoption of any person, these five things are
   required: 
				</p><p>
   1. That he be actually, and of his own right, of another family than
   that into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> he is adopted. He must be the son of one family or
   other, in his own right, as all persons are.
				</p><p>
   2. That there be a family to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> which of himself he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no right,
   into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> he is to be grafted. If a man comes into a family upon a
   personal right, though originally at never so great a distance, that
   man is not adopted. If a man of a most remote consanguinity do come
   into the inheritance of any family by the death of the nearer heirs,
   though his right before were little better than nothing, yet he is a
   born son of that family, -- he is not adopted. [In adoption] he is not
   to have the plea of the most remote possibility of succession.
				</p><p>
   3. That there be an authoritative, legal translation of him, by some
   that have power into that<note n="thereinto">Auto-modernized</note>, from one family into another. It was not, by
   the law of old, in the power of particular persons to adopt when and
   whom they would. It was to be done by the authority of the sovereign
   power.
				</p><p>
   4. That the adopted person be freed from all the obligations that be
   upon him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the family from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is translated; otherwise he can
   be no way useful or serviceable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the family into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> he is
   ingrafted. He cannot serve two masters, much less two fathers.
				</p><p>
   5. That, by virtue of his adoption, he be invested in all the rights,
   privileges, advantages, and title to the whole inheritance, of the
   family into which he is adopted, in as full and ample manner as if he
   had been born a son in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Now, all these things and circumstances do concur and are found in the
   adoption of believers: 
				</p><p>
   1. They are, by their own original right, of another family than that
   into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> they are adopted. They are "by nature the children of wrath,"
   <reference osisRef="Eph.2.3">Ephesians 2:3</reference>, -- sons of wrath, -- of that family whose inheritance is
   "wrath," -- called "the power of darkness," <reference osisRef="Col.1.13">Colossians 1:13</reference>; for from thence
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> God "translate them into the kingdom of his dear Son." This is the
   family of the world and of Satan, of which by nature believers are.
   Whatever is to be inherited in that family, -- as wrath, curse, death,
   hell, -- they have a right to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Neither can they of themselves,
   or by themselves, get free of this family: a strong man armed keeps
   them in subjection. Their natural estate is a family condition,
   attended with all the circumstances of a family, -- family duties and
   services, rights and titles, relations and observances. They are of the
   black family of sin and Satan.
				</p><p>
   2. There is another family into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> they are to be translated, and
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> of themselves they have neither right nor title. This is that
   family in heaven and earth which is called after the name of Christ,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.3.15">Ephesians 3:15</reference>, -- the great family of God. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a [349] house and
   family for his children; of whom some he maintains on the riches of his
   grace, and some he entertains with the fulness of his glory. This is
   that house of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ is the great dispenser, it having
   pleased the Father to "gather together in one all things in him, both
   which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference>
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> live all the sons and daughters of God, spending largely on the
   riches of his grace. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this family of themselves they have no right
   nor title; they are wholly alienated from it, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.12">Ephesians 2:12</reference>, and can lay
   no claim to any thing in it. God driving fallen Adam out of the garden,
   and shutting up all ways of return with a flaming sword, ready to cut
   him off if he should attempt it, abundantly declares that he, and all
   in him, had lost all right of approaching to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in any family
   relation. Corrupted, cursed nature is not vested with the least right
   to any thing of God. Therefore, --
				</p><p>
   3. They have an authoritative translation from one of these families to
   another. It is not done in a private, underhand way, but in the way of
   authority. <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference>, "As many as received him, to them gave he power
   to become the sons of God," -- power or authority. This investing them
   with the power, excellency, and right of the sons of God, is a
   forensical act, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a legal proceeding in it. It is called the
   "making us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
   light," <reference osisRef="Col.1.12">Colossians 1:12</reference>; -- a judicial exalting us into membership in that
   family, where God is the Father, Christ the [350] elder brother, all
   saints and angels brethren and fellow-children, and the inheritance a
   crown immortal and incorruptible, that fades not away.
				</p><p>
   Now, this authoritative translation of believers from one family into
   another consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> of these two parts: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) An effectual proclamation and declaration of such a person's
   immunity from all obligations to the former family, to which by nature
   he was related. And this declaration has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a threefold object: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] Angels. It is declared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them; they are the [351] sons of God.
   They are the sons of God, and so of the family into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> the adopted
   person is to be admitted; and therefore it concerns them to know who
   are invested with the rights of that family, that they may discharge
   their duty towards them. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, then, it is declared that believers
   are freed from the family of sin and hell, to become fellow-sons and
   servants with them. And this is done two ways: 
				</p><p>
   1st. Generally, by the doctrine of the gospel. <reference osisRef="Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:10</reference>, "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   principalities and powers in heavenly places is made known by the
   church the manifold wisdom of God."
				</p><p>
   By the church is this wisdom made known to the angels, either as the
   doctrine of the gospel is delivered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, or as it is gathered
   thereby. And what is this wisdom of God that is thus made known to
   principalities and powers? It is, that "the Gentiles should be
   fellow-heirs and of the same body with us," verse 6. The mystery of
   adopting sinners of the Gentiles, taking them from their slavery in the
   family of the world, that they might have a right of heirship, becoming
   sons in the family of God, is this wisdom, thus made known. And how was
   it primitively made known? It was "revealed by the Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   prophets and apostles," verse 5.
				</p><p>
   2dly. In particular, by immediate revelation. When any particular soul
   is freed from the family of this world, it is revealed to the angels.
   "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God" (that is, among the
   angels, and by them) "over one sinner that repents<note n="repenteth">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Luke.15.10">Luke 15:10</reference>
   Now, the angels cannot of themselves absolutely know the true
   repentance of a sinner in itself; it is a work wrought in that cabinet
   which none has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a key to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> but Jesus Christ; by him it is revealed to
   the angels, when the peculiar care and charge of such a one is
   committed to them. These things have their transaction before the
   angels, <reference osisRef="Luke.12.8-Luke.12.9">Luke 12:8-9</reference> Christ owns the names of his brethren before
   the angels, <reference osisRef="Rev.3.5">Revelation of John 3:5</reference> When he gives them admittance into the family
   where they are, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.22">Hebrews 12:22</reference>, he declares to them that they are sons,
   that they may discharge their duty towards them, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.14">Hebrews 1:14</reference>
				</p><p>
   [2.] It is denounced in a judicial way to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Satan, the great master of
   the family to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they were in subjection. When the Lord Christ
   delivers a soul from under the power of that strong armed one, he binds
   him, -- ties him from the exercise of that power and dominion which
   before he had over him. And by this means does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he know that such a one
   is delivered from his family; and all his future attempts upon him are
   encroaching upon the possession and inheritance of the Lord Christ.
				</p><p>
   [3.] To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the conscience of the person adopted. The Spirit of Christ
   testifies to the heart and conscience of a believer that he is freed
   from all engagements to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the family of Satan, and is become the son of
   God, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.14-Rom.8.15">Romans 8:14-15</reference>; and enables him to cry, "Abba, Father," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference> Of the particulars of this testification of the Spirit, and of
   its absolving the soul from its old alliance, I shall speak afterward.
   And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> consists the first thing mentioned.
				</p><p>
   (2.) There is an authoritative ingrafting of a believer actually into
   the family of God, and investing him with the whole right of sonship.
   Now this, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sundry acts: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] The giving a believer a new name in a white stone, <reference osisRef="Rev.2.17">Revelation of John 2:17</reference>
   They that are adopted are to take new names; they change their names
   they had in their old families, to take the names of the families
   into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> they are translated. This new name is, "A child of God." That
   is the new name given in adoption; and no man knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> what is in that
   name, but only he that does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> receive it. And this new name is given and
   written in a white stone; -- that is the tessera of our admission into
   the house of God. It is a stone of judicial acquitment. Our adoption by
   the Spirit is bottomed on our absolution in the blood of Jesus; and
   therefore is the new name in the white stone privilege grounded on
   discharge. The white stone quits the claim of the old family; the new
   name gives entrance to the other.
				</p><p>
   [2.] An enrolling of his name in the catalogue of the household of God,
   admitting him thereby into fellowship in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. This is called the
   "writing of the house of Israel," <reference osisRef="Ezek.13.9">Ezekiel 13:9</reference>; that is, the roll
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> all the names of the Israel, the family of God, are written.
   God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a catalogue of his household; Christ knows his sheep by name.
   When God writes<note n="writeth">Auto-modernized</note> up the people, he counts that "this man was born in
   Zion," <reference osisRef="Ps.87.6">Psalms 87:6</reference> This is an extract of the Lamb's book of life.
				</p><p>
   [3.] Testifying to his conscience his acceptation with God, enabling
   him to behave himself as a child, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.15">Romans 8:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.4.5-Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:5-6</reference>
				</p><p>
   4. The two last things required to adoption are, that the adopted
   person be freed from all obligations to the family from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is
   translated, and invested with the rights and privileges of that
   into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> he is translated. Now, because these two comprise the whole
   issue of adoption, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the saints have communion with Christ, I
   shall handle them together, referring the concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   these four heads:  (1.) Liberty. (2.) Title, or right. (3.) Boldness.
   (4.) Correction. These are the four things, in reference to the family
   of the adopted person, that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> receive by his adoption, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he
   holds communion with the Lord Jesus: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) Liberty. The Spirit of the Lord, that was upon the Lord Jesus, did
   anoint him to proclaim liberty to the captives, <reference osisRef="Isa.61.1">Isaiah 61:1</reference>; and "where
   the Spirit of the Lord is" (that is, the Spirit of Christ, given to us
   by him because we are sons), "there is liberty," <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.17">2 Corinthians 3:17</reference> All
   spiritual liberty is from the Spirit of adoption; whatever else is
   pretended, is licentiousness. So the apostle argues, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6-Gal.4.7">Galatians 4:6-7</reference>, "He
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent forth his Spirit into their hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> ye are no more servants," -- no more in bondage, but have the
   liberty of sons. And this liberty respects, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] In the first place, the family from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> the adopted person is
   translated. It is his setting free from all the obligations of that
   family. Now, in this sense, the liberty which the saints have by
   adoption is either from that which is real or that which is
   pretended: 
				</p><p>
   1st. That which is real respects a twofold issue of law and sin. The
   moral, unchangeable law of God, and sin, being in union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>, meeting
   with reference to any persons, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> had, a twofold issue: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) An economical institution of a new law of ordinances, keeping in
   bondage those to whom it was given, <reference osisRef="Col.2.14">Colossians 2:14</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) A natural (if I may so call it) pressing of those persons with
   its power and efficacy against sin; of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> there are these parts: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] Its rigour and terror in commanding.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] Its impossibility for accomplishment, and so insufficiency for
   its primitively appointed end.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] The issues of its transgression; which are referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> two
   heads:  1. Curse. 2. Death. I shall speak very briefly of these,
   because they are commonly handled, and granted by all.
				</p><p>
   2dly. That which is pretended, is the power of any whatever over the
   conscience, when once made free by Christ: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) Believers are freed from the instituted law of ordinances,
   which, upon the testimony of the apostles, was a yoke which neither we
   nor our fathers (in the faith) could bear, <reference osisRef="Acts.15.10">Acts 15:10</reference>; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ "blotted out this hand-writing of ordinances that was against
   them, which was contrary to them, and took it out of the way, nailing
   it to his cross," <reference osisRef="Col.2.14">Colossians 2:14</reference>: and thereupon the apostle, after a long
   dispute concerning the liberty that we have from that law, concludes
   with this instruction: <reference osisRef="Gal.5.1">Galatians 5:1</reference>, "Stand fast in the liberty with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made us free."
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) In reference so the moral law: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] The first thing we have liberty from, is its rigour and terror
   in commanding. <reference osisRef="Heb.12.18-Heb.12.22">Hebrews 12:18-22</reference>, "We are not come to the mount that
   might be touched, and that burned with fire, to the whirlwind,
   darkness, and tempest, to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of
   words, which they that heard besought that they might hear it no more;
   but we are come to mount Sion," etc. As to that administration of the
   law in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it was given out with dread and terror, and so exacted its
   obedience with rigour, we are freed from it, we are not called to that
   estate.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] Its impossibility of accomplishment, and so insufficiency for
   its primitive end, by reason of sin; or, we are freed from the law as
   the instrument of righteousness, since, by the impossibility of its
   fulfilling as to us, it is become insufficient for any such purpose,
   <reference osisRef="Rom.8.2-Rom.8.3">Romans 8:2-3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.3.21-Gal.3.23">Galatians 3:21-23</reference> There being an impossibility of
   obtaining life by the law, we are exempted from it as to any such end,
   and that by the righteousness of Christ, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.3">Romans 8:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] From the issue of its transgression: 
				</p><p>
   First. Curse. There is a solemn curse inwrapping the whole wrath
   annexed to the law, with reference to the transgression of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; and
   from this are we wholly at liberty. <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference>, "Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> redeemed
   us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us."
				</p><p>
   Secondly. Death, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.15">Hebrews 2:15</reference>; and therewith from Satan, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference>,
   <reference osisRef="Col.1.13">Colossians 1:13</reference>; and sin, <reference osisRef="Rom.6.1 Rom.6.14">Romans 6:1, 14</reference> Pet. i. 18; with the world, <reference osisRef="Gal.1.4">Galatians 1:4</reference>; with all the attendancies, advantages, and claims of them all, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.3-Gal.4.5">Galatians 4:3-5</reference>, <reference osisRef="Col.2.20">Colossians 2:20</reference>; without which we could not live one day.
				</p><p>
   That which is pretended and claimed by some (in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> in deed and in
   truth we were never in bondage, but are hereby eminently set free), is
   the power of binding conscience by any laws and constitutions not from
   God, <reference osisRef="Col.2.20-Col.2.22">Colossians 2:20-22</reference>
				</p><p>
   [2.] [In the second place,] there is a liberty in the family of God, as
   well as a liberty from the family of Satan. Sons are free. Their
   obedience is a free obedience; they have the Spirit of the Lord: and
   where he is, there is liberty, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.17">2 Corinthians 3:17</reference> As a Spirit of adoption,
   he is opposed to the spirit of bondage, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.15">Romans 8:15</reference> Now, this
   liberty of our Father's family, which we have as sons and children,
   being adopted by Christ through the Spirit, is a spiritual largeness of
   heart, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the children of God do freely, willingly, genuinely,
   without fear, terror, bondage, and constraint, go forth to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all holy
   obedience in Christ.
				</p><p>
   I say, this is our liberty in our Father's family: what we have liberty
   from, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been already declared.
				</p><p>
   There are Gibeonites outwardly attending the family of God, that do the
   service of his house as the drudgery of their lives. The principle they
   yield obedience upon, is a spirit of bondage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> fear, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.15">Romans 8:15</reference>;
   the rule they do it by, is the law in its dread and rigour, exacting it
   of them to the utmost, without mercy and mitigation; the end they do it
   for, is to fly from the wrath to come, to pacify conscience, and seek
   righteousness as it were by the works of the law. Thus servilely,
   painfully, fruitlessly, they seek to serve their own conviction all
   their days.
				</p><p>
   The saints by adoption have a largeness of heart in all holy obedience.
   Says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> David, "I will walk at liberty, for I seek your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> precepts," <reference osisRef="Ps.119.45">Psalms 119:45</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.61.1">Isaiah 61:1</reference>; <reference osisRef="Luke.4.18">Luke 4:18</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.8.2 Rom.8.21">Romans 8:2, 21</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.4.7">Galatians 4:7</reference>, v. 1,
   13; <reference osisRef="Jas.1.25">James 1:25</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.8.32-John.8.33 John.8.36">John 8:32-33, 36</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.6.18">Romans 6:18</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.16">1 Peter 2:16</reference>
   Now, this amplitude, or son-like freedom of the Spirit in obedience,
   consists in sundry things: 
				</p><p>
   1st. In the principles of all spiritual service; which are life and
   love; -- the one respecting the matter of their obedience, giving them
   power; the other respecting the manner of their obedience, giving them
   joy and sweetness in it: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) It is from life; that gives them power as to the matter of
   obedience. <reference osisRef="Rom.8.2">Romans 8:2</reference>, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
   sets them free from the law of sin and death." It frees them, it
   carries them out to all obedience freely; so that "they walk after the
   Spirit," verse 1, that being the principle of their workings. <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference>, "Christ lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note> in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I
   live by the faith of the Son of God;" -- "The life which I now live in
   the flesh (that is, the obedience which I yield to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> I am in
   the flesh), it is from a principle of life, Christ living in me. There
   is, then, power for all living to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, from Christ in them, the
   Spirit of life from Christ carrying them out thereto. The fruits of a
   dead root are but dead excrescences; living acts are from a principle
   of life.
				</p><p>
   Hence you may see the difference between the liberty that slaves
   assume, and the liberty which is due to children: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] Slaves take liberty from duty; children have liberty in duty.
   There is not a greater mistake in the world, than that the liberty of
   sons in the house of God consists in this, -- they can perform duties,
   or take the freedom to omit them; they can serve in the family of God
   (that is, they think they may if they will), and they can choose
   whether they will or no. This is a liberty stolen by slaves, not a
   liberty given by the Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sons.
				</p><p>
   The liberty of sons is in the inward spiritual freedom of their hearts,
   naturally and kindly going out in all the ways and worship of God. When
   they find themselves straitened and shut up in them, they wrestle with
   God for enlargement, and are never contented with the doing of a duty,
   unless it be done as in Christ, with free, genuine, and enlarged
   hearts. The liberty that servants have is from duty; the liberty given
   to sons is in duty.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] The liberty of slaves or servants is from mistaken, deceiving
   conclusions; the liberty of sons is from the power of the indwelling
   Spirit of grace. Or, the liberty of servants is from outward, dead
   conclusions; the liberty of sons, from an inward, living principle.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) Love, as to the manner of their obedience, gives them delight
   and joy. <reference osisRef="John.14.15">John 14:15</reference>, "If ye love me," says Christ, "keep my
   commandments." Love is the bottom of all their duties; hence our
   Saviour resolves all obedience into the love of God and our neighbour;
   and Paul, upon the same ground, tells us "that love is the fulfilling
   of the law," <reference osisRef="Rom.13.10">Romans 13:10</reference> Where love is in any duty, it is complete
   in Christ. How often does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> David, even with admiration, express this
   principle of his walking with God! "O," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "how I love your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   commandments! "This gives saints delight, that the commandments of
   Christ are not grievous to them. Jacob's hard service was not grievous
   to him, because of his love to Rachel. No duty of a saint is grievous
   to him, because of his love to Christ. They do from hence all things
   with delight and complacency. Hence do they long for advantages of
   walking with God, -- pant after more ability; and this is a great share
   of their son-like freedom in obedience. It gives them joy in it. <reference osisRef="1John.4.18">1 John 4:18</reference>, "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts<note n="casteth">Auto-modernized</note> out fear."
   When their soul is acted to obedience by love, it expels that fear
   which is the issue of bondage upon the spirit. Now, when there is a
   concurrence of these two (life and love), there is freedom, liberty,
   largeness of heart, exceedingly distanced from that strait and bondaged
   frame which many walk in all their days, that know not the adoption of
   sons.
				</p><p>
   2dly. The object of their obedience is represented to them as
   desirable, whereas to others it is terrible. In all their approaches to
   God, they eye him as a Father; they call him Father, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference>, not in
   the form of words, but in the spirit of sons. God in Christ is
   continually before them; not only as one deserving all the honours and
   obedience which he requires, but also as one exceedingly to be
   delighted in, as being all-sufficient to satisfy and satiate all the
   desires of the soul. When others napkin their talents, as having to
   deal with an austere master, they draw out their strength to the
   uttermost, as drawing nigh to a gracious rewarder. They go, from the
   principle of life and love, to the bosom of a living and loving Father;
   they do but return the strength they do receive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the fountain, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the ocean.
				</p><p>
   3dly. Their motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience is love, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.14">2 Corinthians 5:14</reference> From an
   apprehension of love, they are effectually carried out by love to give
   up themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who is love. What a freedom is this! what a
   largeness of spirit is in them who walk according to this rule!
   Darkness, fear, bondage, conviction, hopes of righteousness, accompany
   others in their ways; the sons, by the Spirit of adoption, have light,
   love, with complacency, in all their walkings with God. The world is a
   universal stranger to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the frame of children in their Father's house.
				</p><p>
   4thly. The manner of their obedience is willingness. "They yield
   themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, as those that are alive from the dead," <reference osisRef="Rom.6.13">Romans 6:13</reference>; they yield themselves, -- give up themselves willingly, cheerfully,
   freely. "With my whole heart," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> David. <reference osisRef="Rom.12.1">Romans 12:1</reference>, "They present
   themselves a living sacrifice," and a willing sacrifice.
				</p><p>
   5thly. The rule of their walking with God is the law of liberty, as
   divested of all its terrifying, threatening, killing, condemning,
   cursing power; and rendered, in the blood of Jesus, sweet, tender,
   useful, directing, -- helpful as a rule of walking in the life they
   have received, not the way of working for the life they have not. I
   might give more instances. These may suffice to manifest that liberty
   of obedience in the family of God which his sons and daughters have,
   that the poor convinced Gibeonites are not acquainted withal.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The second thing which the children of God have by adoption is
   title. They have title and right to all the privileges and advantages
   of the family into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> they are translated. This is the pre-eminence
   of the true sons of any family. The ground on which Sarah pleaded the
   ejection of Ishmael was, that he was the son of the bond woman, <reference osisRef="Gen.21.10">Genesis 21:10</reference>, and so no genuine child of the family; and therefore could
   have no right of heirship with Isaac. The apostle's arguing is, "We are
   no more servants, but sons; and if sons, then heirs," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.14-Rom.8.17">Romans 8:14-17</reference>,
   -- "then have we right and title: and being not born to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> (for by
   nature we are the children of wrath), we have this right by our
   adoption."
				</p><p>
   Now, the saints hereby have a double right and title: 1st. Proper and
   direct, in respect of spirituals. 2dly. Consequential, in respect of
   temporals: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] The first, also, or the title, as adopted sons, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> spirituals,
   is, in respect of the object of it, twofold:  (1st.) To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a present
   place, name, and room, in the house of God, and all the privileges and
   administrations of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. (2dly.) To a future fulness of the great
   inheritance of glory, -- of a kingdom purchased for that whole family
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> they are by Jesus Christ: 
				</p><p>
   1st. They have a title to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and an interest in, the whole
   administration of the family of God here.
				</p><p>
   The supreme administration of the house of God in the hand of the Lord
   Christ, as to the institution of ordinances and dispensation of the
   Spirit, to enliven and make effectual those ordinances for the end of
   their institution, is the prime notion of this administration. And
   of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> they are the prime objects; all this is for them, and exercised
   towards them. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given Jesus Christ to be the "head over all
   things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, which is his body," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.22-Eph.1.23">Ephesians 1:22-23</reference>: he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   made him the head over all these spiritual things, committed the
   authoritative administration of them all to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, to the use and
   behoof of the church; that is, the family of God. It is for the benefit
   and advantage of the many sons whom he will bring to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> glory that he
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> all these things, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.10">Hebrews 2:10</reference>; see <reference osisRef="Eph.4.8-Eph.4.13">Ephesians 4:8-13</reference> The aim of the
   Lord Jesus in establishing gospel administrations, and administrators,
   is "for the perfecting of the saints, the work of the ministry," etc.
   All is for then, all is for the family. In that is the faithfulness of
   Christ exercised; he is faithful in all the house of God, <reference osisRef="Heb.3.2">Hebrews 3:2</reference>
   Hence the apostle tells the Corinthians, <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.22-1Cor.3.23">1 Corinthians 3:22-23</reference>, of all
   these gospel administrations and ordinances, they are all theirs, and
   all for them. What benefit soever redounds<note n="redoundeth">Auto-modernized</note> to the world by the things
   of the gospel (as much does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> every way), it is engaged for it to the
   children of this family. This, then, is the aim and intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of the
   Lord Christ in the institution of all gospel ordinances and
   administrations, -- that they may be of use for the house and family of
   God, and all his children and servants in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   It is true, the word is preached to all the world, to gather in the
   children of God's purpose that are scattered up and down in the world,
   and to leave the rest inexcusable; but the prime end and aim of the
   Lord Christ thereby is, to gather in those heirs of salvation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   enjoyment of that feast of fat things which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> prepared for them
   in his house.
				</p><p>
   Again: they, and they only, have right and title to gospel
   administrations, and the privileges of the family of God, as they are
   held out in his church according to his mind. The church is the "house
   of God," <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.15">1 Timothy 3:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.3.6">Hebrews 3:6</reference>; in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he keeps and maintains his
   whole family, ordering them according to his mind and will. Now, who
   shall have any right in the house of God, but only his children? We
   will not allow a right to any but our own children in our houses: will
   God, think you, allow any right in his house but to his children? Is it
   meet, to "take the children's bread and cast it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the dogs?" We
   shall see that none but children have any right or title to the
   privileges and advantages of the house of God, if we consider, --
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The nature of that house. It is made up of such persons as it is
   impossible that any but adopted children should have right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a place
   in it. It is composed of "living stones," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.5">1 Peter 2:5</reference>; -- a "chosen
   generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,"
   verse 9; -- "saints and faithful in Christ Jesus," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.1">Ephesians 1:1</reference>; --
   "saints and faithful brethren," <reference osisRef="Col.1.2">Colossians 1:2</reference>; -- a people that are "all
   righteous," <reference osisRef="Isa.60.21">Isaiah 60:21</reference>; and the whole fabric of it is glorious, chap.
   liv. 11-14, -- the way of the house is "a way of holiness," which the
   unclean shall not pass through, chap. xxxv. 8; yea, expressly, they are
   the "sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty," and they only, <reference osisRef="2Cor.6.17-2Cor.6.18">2 Corinthians 6:17-18</reference>; all others are excluded, <reference osisRef="Rev.21.27">Revelation of John 21:27</reference> It is true that
   oftentimes, at unawares, other persons creep into the great house of
   God; and so there become in it "not only vessels of gold and silver,
   but also of wood and of earth," etc., <reference osisRef="2Tim.2.20">2 Timothy 2:20</reference>; but they only
   creep in, as Jude speaks, verse 4, they have no right nor title to it.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) The privileges of the house are such as they will not suit nor
   profit any other. To what purpose is it to give food to a dead man?
   Will he grow strong by it? will he increase upon it? The things of the
   family and house of God are food for living souls. Now, children only
   are alive, all others are dead in trespasses and sins. What will
   outward signs avail, if life and power be away? Look upon what
   particular you please of the saints' enjoyments in the family of God,
   you shall find them all suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> believers; and, being bestowed on
   the world, [they] would be a pearl in the snout of a swine.
				</p><p>
   It is, then, only the sons of the family that have this right; they
   have fellowship with one another, and that fellowship with the Father
   and the Son Jesus Christ; they set forth the Lord's death till he come;
   they are intrusted with all the ordinances of the house, and the
   administration of them. And who shall deny them the enjoyment of this
   right, or keep them from what Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> purchased for them? And the
   Lord will in the end give them hearts everywhere to make use of this
   title accordingly, and not to wander on the mountains, forgetting their
   resting-place.
				</p><p>
   2dly. They have a title to the future fulness of the inheritance that
   is purchased for this whole family by Jesus Christ. So the apostle
   argues, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.17">Romans 8:17</reference>, "If children, then heirs," etc. All God's
   children are "first-born," <reference osisRef="Heb.12.23">Hebrews 12:23</reference>; and therefore are heirs: hence
   the whole weight of glory that is prepared for them is called the
   inheritance, <reference osisRef="Col.1.12">Colossians 1:12</reference>, "The inheritance of the saints in light." "If
   ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
   promise," <reference osisRef="Gal.3.29">Galatians 3:29</reference> Heirs of the promise; that is, of all things
   promised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Abraham in and with Christ.
				</p><p>
   There are three things that in this regard the children of God are said
   to be heirs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The promise; as in that place of <reference osisRef="Gal.3.29">Galatians 3:29</reference> and <reference osisRef="Heb.6.17">Hebrews 6:17</reference>
   God shows to "the heirs of the promise the immutability of his
   counsel;" as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are said to be "heirs of the
   same promise," <reference osisRef="Heb.11.9">Hebrews 11:9</reference> God had from the foundation of the world
   made a most excellent promise in Christ, containing a deliverance from
   all evil, and an engagement for the bestowing of all good things upon
   them. It contains a deliverance from all the evil which the guilt of
   sin and dominion of Satan had brought upon them, with an investiture of
   them in all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in Christ Jesus.
   Hence, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.15">Hebrews 9:15</reference>, the Holy Ghost calls it a "promise of the eternal
   inheritance." This, in the first place, are the adopted children of God
   heirs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Look, whatever is in the promise which God made at the
   beginning to fallen man, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> since solemnly renewed and confirmed
   by his oath; they are heirs of it, and are accepted in their claim for
   their inheritance in the courts of heaven.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) They are heirs of righteousness, <reference osisRef="Heb.11.7">Hebrews 11:7</reference> Noah was an heir
   of the righteousness which is by faith; which Peter calls a being "heir
   of the grace of life," <reference osisRef="1Pet.3.7">1 Peter 3:7</reference> And James puts both these
   together, chap. ii. 5, "Heirs of the kingdom which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised;"
   that is, of the kingdom of grace, and the righteousness of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. And in
   this respect it is that the apostle tells us, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.11">Ephesians 1:11</reference>, that "we have
   obtained an inheritance;" which he also places with the righteousness
   of faith, <reference osisRef="Acts.26.18">Acts 26:18</reference> Now, by this righteousness, grace, and
   inheritance, is not only intended that righteousness which we are here
   actually made partakers of, but also the end and accomplishment of that
   righteousness in glory; which is also assured in the next place, --
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) They are "heirs of salvation," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.14">Hebrews 1:14</reference>, and "heirs according
   to the hope of eternal life," <reference osisRef="Titus.3.7">Titus 3:7</reference>; which Peter calls an
   "inheritance incorruptible," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.4">1 Peter 1:4</reference>; and Paul, the "reward of the
   inheritance," <reference osisRef="Col.3.24">Colossians 3:24</reference>, -- that is, the issue of the inheritance of
   light and holiness, which they already enjoy. Thus, then, distinguish
   the full salvation by Christ into the foundation of it, the promises;
   and the means of it, righteousness and holiness; and the end of it,
   eternal glory. The sons of God have a right and title to all, in that
   they are made heirs with Christ.
				</p><p>
   And this is that which is the main of the saints' title and right,
   which they have by adoption; which in sum is, that the Lord is their
   portion and inheritance, and they are the inheritance of the Lord: and
   a large portion it is that they have; the lines are fallen to them in a
   goodly place.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Besides this principal, the adopted sons of God have a second
   consequential right, -- a right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the things of this world; that is,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the portions of it which God is pleased to intrust them here
   withal. Christ is the "heir of all things," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.2">Hebrews 1:2</reference>; all right and
   title to the things of the creation was lost and forfeited by sin. The
   Lord, by his sovereignty, had made an original grant of all things here
   below for man's use; he had appointed the residue of the works of his
   hands, in their several stations, to be serviceable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his behoof.
   Sin reversed this whole grant and institution, -- all things were set
   at liberty from this subjection to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; yet that liberty, being a
   taking them off from the end to which they were originally appointed,
   is a part of their vanity and curse. It is evil to any thing to be laid
   aside as to the end to which it was primitively appointed. By this
   means the whole creation is turned loose from any subordinate ruler;
   and man, having lost the whole title through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he held his dominion over
   and possession of the creatures, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not the least colour of interest
   in any of them, nor can lay any claim to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. But now the Lord,
   intending to take a portion to himself out of the lump of fallen
   mankind, whom he appointed heirs of salvation, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not immediately
   destroy the works of creation, but reserve them for their use in their
   pilgrimage. To this end he invests the whole right and title of them in
   the second Adam, which the first had lost; he appoints him "heir of all
   things." And thereupon his adopted ones, being "fellow-heirs with
   Christ," become also to have a right and title to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the things of this
   creation. To clear up this right, what it is, I must give some few
   observations: 
				</p><p>
   1st. The right they have is not as the right that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>; that is,
   sovereign and supreme, to do what he will with his own; but theirs is
   subordinate, and such as that they must be accountable for the use of
   those things to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they have a right and title. The right of Christ
   is the right of the Lord of the house; the right of the saints is the
   right of servants.
				</p><p>
   2dly. That the whole number of the children of God have a right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the whole earth, which is the Lord's, and the fulness of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, in these
   two regards: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) He who is the sovereign Lord of it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> preserve it merely for
   their use, and upon their account; all others whatever being malae
   fidei possessores, invading a portion of the Lord's territories,
   without grant or leave from him.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) In that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised to give them the kingdom and
   dominion of it, in such a way and manner as in his providence he shall
   dispose; that is, that the government of the earth shall be exercised
   to their advantage.
				</p><p>
   3dly. This right is a spiritual right, which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not give a civil
   interest, but only sanctifies the right and interest bestowed. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   providentially disposed of the civil bounds of the inheritance of men,
   <reference osisRef="Acts.17.26">Acts 17:26</reference>, suffering the men of the world to enjoy a portion here,
   and that oftentimes very full and plenteous; and that for his
   children's sake, that those beasts of the forest, which are made to be
   destroyed, may not break loose upon the whole possession. Hence, --
				</p><p>
   4thly. No one particular adopted person has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any right, by virtue
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, to any portion of earthly things to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not right
   and title upon a civil interest, given him by the providence of God.
   But, --
				</p><p>
   5thly. This they have by their adoption; that, --
				</p><p>
   (1st.) Look, what portion soever God is pleased to give them, they have
   a right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, as it is re-invested in Christ, and not as it lies
   wholly under the curse and vanity that is come upon the creation by
   sin; and therefore can never be called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> an account for usurping
   that which they have no right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, as shall all the sons of men who
   violently grasp those things which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> set at liberty from under
   their dominion because of sin.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) By this their right, they are led to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a sanctified use of what
   thereby they do enjoy; inasmuch as the things themselves are to them
   pledges of the Father's love, washed in the blood of Christ, and
   endearments upon their spirits to live to his praise who gives them all
   things richly to enjoy.
				</p><p>
   And this is a second thing we have by our adoption; and hence I dare
   say of unbelievers, they have no true right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any thing, of what
   kind soever, that they do possess.
				</p><p>
   They have no true, unquestionable right, I say, even to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the temporal
   things they do possess; it is true they have a civil right in respect
   of others, but they have not a sanctified right in respect of their own
   souls. They have a right and title that will hold plea in the courts of
   men, but not a right that will hold in the court of God, and in their
   own conscience. It will one day be sad with them, when they shall come
   to give an account of their enjoyments. They shall not only be reckoned
   withal for the abuse of that they have possessed, that they have not
   used and laid it out for the glory of him whose it is; but also, that
   they have even laid their hands upon the creatures of God, and kept
   them from them for whose sakes alone they are preserved from
   destruction. When the God of glory shall come home to any of them,
   either in their consciences here, or in the judgment that is for to
   come, and speak with the terror of a revengeful judge, "I have suffered
   you to enjoy corn, wine, and oil, -- a great portion of my creatures;
   you have rolled yourselves in wealth and prosperity, when the right
   heirs of these things lived poor, and low, and mean, at the next doors;
   -- give in now an answer what and how you have used these things. What
   have you laid out for the service and advancement of the gospel? What
   have you given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them for whom nothing was provided? what
   contribution have you made for the poor saints? Have you had a ready
   hand, and willing mind, to lay down all for my sake?" -- when they
   shall be compelled to answer, as the truth is, "Lord, we had, indeed, a
   large portion in the world; but we took it to be our own, and thought
   we might have done what we would with our own. We have ate the fat, and
   drank the sweet, and left the rest of our substance for our babes: we
   have spent somewhat upon our lusts, somewhat upon our friends; but the
   truth is, we cannot say that we made friends of this unrighteous
   mammon, -- that we used it to the advancement of the gospel, or for
   ministering to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> poor saints: and now, behold, we must die,"
   etc.:  so also, when the Lord shall proceed farther, and question not
   only the use of these things, but also their title to them, and tell
   them, "The earth is mine, and the fulness of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. I did, indeed, make
   an original grant of these things to man; but that is lost by sin: I
   have restored it only for my saints. Why have you laid, then, your
   fingers of prey upon that which was not yours? why have you compelled
   my creatures to serve you and your lusts, which I had set loose from
   under your dominion? Give me my flax, my wine, and wool; I will set you
   naked as in the day of your birth, and revenge upon you your rapine,
   and unjust possession of that which was not yours:" -- I say, at such a
   time, what will men do?
				</p><p>
   (3.) [352] Boldness with God by Christ is another privilege of our
   adoption. But of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> I have spoken at large before, in treating of the
   excellency of Christ in respect of our approach to God by him; so that
   I shall not re-assume the consideration of it.
				</p><p>
   (4.) Affliction, also, as proceeding from love, as leading to spiritual
   advantages, as conforming to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, as sweetened with his presence,
   is the privilege of children, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.3-Heb.12.6">Hebrews 12:3-6</reference>; but on these particulars I
   must not insist.
				</p><p>
   This, I say, is the head and source of all the privileges which Christ
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> purchased for us, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> also we have fellowship with him:
   fellowship in name; we are (as he is) sons of God: fellowship in title
   and right; we are heirs, co-heirs with Christ: fellowship in likeness
   and conformity; we are predestinated to be like the first-born of the
   family: fellowship in honour; he is not ashamed to call us brethren:
   fellowship in sufferings; he learned obedience by what he suffered, and
   every son is to be scourged that is received: fellowship in his
   kingdom; we shall reign with him. Of all which I must speak peculiarly
   in another place, and so shall not here draw out the discourse
   concerning them any farther.

<title>Part III. Of Communion with the Holy Ghost.</title>
<p></p>

<title>Part 3 Chapter 1</title>
<p>
   The foundation of our communion with the Holy Ghost (<reference osisRef="John.16.1-John.16.7">John 16:1-7</reference>)
   opened at large -- Parakletos, a Comforter; who he is -- The Holy
   Ghost; his own will in his coming to us; sent also by Christ -- The
   Spirit sent as a sanctifier and as a comforter -- The adjuncts of his
   mission considered -- The foundation of his mission, <reference osisRef="John.15.26">John 15:26</reference> -- His
   procession from the Father twofold; as to personality, or to office --
   Things considerable in his procession as to office the manner of his
   collation -- He is given freely; sent authoritatively -- The sin
   against the Holy Ghost, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> unpardonable -- How we ask the Spirit of
   the Father -- To grieve the Spirit, what -- Poured out -- How the Holy
   Ghost is received; by faith -- Faith's actings in receiving the Holy
   Ghost -- His abode with us, how declared -- How we may lose our comfort
   while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> the Comforter abides with us.
				</p><p>
   The foundation of all our communion with the Holy Ghost consisting in
   his mission, or sending to be our comforter, by Jesus Christ, the whole
   matter of that economy or dispensation is firstly to be proposed and
   considered, that so we may have a right understanding of the truth
   inquired after. Now, the main promise of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, and the chief
   considerations of it, with the good received and evil prevented
   thereby, being given and declared in the beginning of the 16th chapter
   of John, I shall take a view of the state of it as there proposed.
				</p><p>
   Our blessed Saviour being to leave the world, having acquainted his
   disciples, among other things, what entertainment in general they were
   like to find in it and meet withal, gives the reason why he now gave
   them the doleful tidings of it, considering how sad and dispirited they
   were upon the mention of his departure from them. Verse 1, "These
   things have I spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, that ye should not be offended." -- "I
   have," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "given you an acquaintance with these things (that is,
   the things which will come upon you, which you are to suffer)
   beforehand, lest you who, poor souls! have entertained expectations of
   another state of affairs, should be surprised, so as to be offended at
   me and my doctrine, and fall away from me. You are now forewarned, and
   know what you have to look for. Yea," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, verse 2, "having
   acquainted you in general that you shall be persecuted, I tell you
   plainly that there shall be a combination of all men against you, and
   all sorts of men will put forth their power for your ruin." -- "They
   shall cast you out of the synagogues; yea, the time comes that
   whosoever kills<note n="killeth">Auto-modernized</note> you will think that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> God service." -- "The
   ecclesiastical power shall excommunicate you, -- they shall put you out
   of their synagogues: and that you may not expect relief from the power
   of the magistrate against their perversity, they will kill you: and
   that you may know that they will do it to the purpose, without check or
   control, they will think that in killing you they do God good service;
   which will cause them to act rigorously, and to the utmost."
				</p><p>
   "But this is a shaking trial," might they reply: "is our condition
   such, that men, in killing us, will think to approve their consciences
   to God?" "Yea, they will," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> our Saviour; "but yet, that you be not
   mistaken, nor trouble your consciences about their confidences, know
   that their blind and desperate ignorance is the cause of their fury and
   persuasion," verse 3, "These things will they do to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you, because they
   have not known the Father, nor me."
				</p><p>
   This, then, was to be the state with the disciples. But why did our
   Saviour tell it them at this season, to add fear and perplexities to
   their grief and sorrow? what advantage should they obtain thereby?
   Says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> their blessed Master, verse 4, "There are weighty reasons why I
   should tell you these things; chiefly, that as you may be provided for
   them, so, when they do befall you, you may be supported with the
   consideration of my Deity and omniscience, who told you all these
   things before they came to pass," verse 4, "But these things have I
   told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told
   you of them." "But if they be so necessary, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is it that you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> have<note n="hast">Auto-modernized</note>
   not acquainted us with it all this while? why not in the beginning, --
   at our first calling?" "Even," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> our Saviour, "because there was no
   need of any such thing; for while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> I was with you, you had protection
   and direction at hand." -- "?And these things I said not at the
   beginning, because I was present with you:' but now the state of things
   is altered; I must leave you," verse 4. "And for your parts, so are you
   astonished with sorrow, that you do not ask me whither I go;' the
   consideration of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> would certainly relieve you, seeing I go to take
   possession of my glory, and to carry on the work of your salvation: but
   your hearts are filled with sorrow and fears, and you do not so much as
   inquire after relief," verses 5, 6. Whereupon he adjoins that wonderful
   assertion, verse 7, "Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient
   for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not
   come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you; but if I depart, I will send him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you."
				</p><p>
   This verse, then, being the peculiar foundation of what shall afterward
   be declared, must particularly be considered, as to the words of it and
   their interpretation; and that both with respect to the preface of them
   and the asseveration in them, with the reason annexed to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   1. The preface to them: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) The first word, halla, is an adversative, not excepting to any
   thing of what himself had spoken before, but to their apprehension: "I
   know you have sad thoughts of these things; but yet, nevertheless."
				</p><p>
   (2.) Ego ten aletheian lego humin, "I tell you the truth." The words
   are exceedingly emphatical, and denote some great thing to be ushered
   in by them. First, Ego, -- "I tell it you, this that shall now be
   spoken; I who love you, who take care of you, who am now about to lay
   down my life for you; they are my dying words, that you may believe me;
   I who am truth itself, I tell you." And, --
				</p><p>
   Ego ten aletheian lego, -- "I tell you the truth." "You have in your
   sad, misgiving hearts many misapprehensions of things. You think if I
   would abide with you, all these evils might be prevented; but, alas!
   you know not what is good for you, nor what is expedient. I tell you
   the truth;' this is truth itself; and quiet your hearts in it." There
   is need of a great deal of evidence of truth, to comfort their souls
   that are dejected and disconsolate under an apprehension of the absence
   of Christ from them, be the apprehension true or false.
				</p><p>
   And this is the first part of the words of our Saviour, the preface to
   what he was to deliver to them, by way of a weighty, convincing
   asseveration, to disentangle thereby the thoughts of his disciples from
   prejudice, and to prepare them for the receiving of that great truth
   which he was to deliver.
				</p><p>
   2. The assertion itself follows: Sumpherei humin, hina ego apeltho, --
   It is expedient for you that I go away."
				</p><p>
   There are two things in the words:  Christ's departure; and the
   usefulness of it to his disciples: 
				</p><p>
   For his departure, it is known what is intended by it; -- the
   withdrawing his bodily presence from the earth after his resurrection,
   the "heaven being to receive him, until the times of the restitution of
   all things," <reference osisRef="Acts.3.21">Acts 3:21</reference>; for in respect of his Deity, and the
   exercise of love and care towards them, he promised to be with them to
   the end of the world, <reference osisRef="Matt.28.20">Matthew 28:20</reference> Of this says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, Sumpherei
   humin, -- "It conduces<note n="conduceth">Auto-modernized</note> to your good; it is profitable for you; it is
   for your advantage; it will answer the end that you aim at." That is
   the sense of the word which we have translated "expedient;" -- "It is
   for your profit and advantage." This, then, is that which our Saviour
   asserts, and that with the earnestness before mentioned, desiring to
   convince his sorrowful followers of the truth of it, -- namely, that
   his departure, which they so much feared and were troubled to think of,
   would turn to their profit and advantage.
				</p><p>
   3. Now, although it might be expected that they should acquiesce in
   this asseveration of truth itself, yet because they were generally
   concerned in the ground of the truth of it, he acquaints them with that
   also; and, that we may confess it to be a great matter, that gives
   certainty and evidence to that proposition, he expresses it negatively
   and positively: "If I go not away, he will not come; but if I depart, I
   will send him." Concerning the going away of Christ I have spoken
   before; of the Comforter, his coming and sending, I shall now treat, as
   being the thing aimed at.
				</p><p>
   Ho parakletos: the word being of sundry significations, many
   translations have thought fit not to restrain it, but do retain the
   original word "paracletus;" so the Syriac also: and, as some think, it
   was a word before in use among the Jews (from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> the Chaldee paraphrast
   makes use of it, <reference osisRef="Job.16.20">Job 16:20</reference> [353] ); and amongst them it signifies one
   that so taught others as to delight them also in his teaching, -- that
   is, to be their comforter. In Scripture it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> two eminent
   significations, -- an "advocate" and a "comforter;" in the first sense
   our Saviour is called parakletos, <reference osisRef="1John.2.1">1 John 2:1</reference> Whether it be better
   rendered here an advocate or a comforter may be doubted.
				</p><p>
   Look into the foregoing occasion of the words, which is the disciples'
   sorrow and trouble, and it seems to require the Comforter: "Sorrow has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   filled your hearts; but I will send you the Comforter;" -- look into
   the next words following, which contain his peculiar work for which he
   is now promised to be sent, and they require he should be an Advocate,
   to plead the cause of Christ against the world, verse 8. I shall choose
   rather to interpret the promise by the occasion of it, which was the
   sorrow of his disciples, and to retain the name of the Comforter.
				</p><p>
   Who this Comforter is, our blessed Saviour had before declared, chap.
   xv. 26. He is Pneuma tes aletheias, "the Spirit of truth;" that is, the
   Holy Ghost, who reveals<note n="revealeth">Auto-modernized</note> all truth to the sons of men. Now, of this
   Comforter two things are affirmed:  (1.) That he shall come. (2.) That
   Christ shall send him.
				</p><p>
   (1.) That he shall come. The affirmative of his coming on the
   performance of that condition of it, of Christ going away, is included
   in the negation of his coming without its accomplishment: "If I go not
   away, he will not come;" -- "If I do go (eleusetai), he will come." So
   that there is not only the mission of Christ, but the will of the
   Spirit, in his coming: "He will come," -- his own will is in his work.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Pempso auton, -- "I will send him." The mystery of his sending the
   Spirit, our Saviour instructs his disciples in by degrees. Chap. xiv.
   16, he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
   Comforter;" in the progress of his discourse he gets one step more upon
   their faith, verse 26, "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,
   whom the Father will send in my name;" but, chap. xv. 26, he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "I
   will send him from the Father;" and here, absolutely, "I will send
   him." The business of sending the Holy Ghost by Christ -- which argues
   his personal procession also from him, the Son -- was a deep mystery,
   which at once they could not bear; and therefore he thus instructs them
   in it by degrees.
				</p><p>
   This is the sum:  the presence of the Holy Ghost with believers as a
   comforter, sent by Christ for those ends and purposes for which he is
   promised, is better and more profitable for believers than any
   corporeal presence of Christ can be, now he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> fulfilled the one
   sacrifice for sin which he was to offer.
				</p><p>
   Now, the Holy Spirit is promised under a twofold consideration:  [1.]
   As a Spirit of sanctification to the elect, to convert them and make
   them believers. [2.] As a Spirit of consolation to believers, to give
   them the privileges of the death and purchase of Christ: it is in the
   latter sense only in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is here spoken of. Now, as to his presence
   with us in this regard, and the end and purposes for which he is sent,
   for what is aimed at, observe, -- 1st. The rise and fountain of it;
   2dly. The manner of his being given; 3dly. Our manner of receiving him;
   4thly. His abiding with us; 5thly. His acting in us; 6thly. What are
   the effects of his working in us: and then how we hold communion with
   him will from all these appear.
				</p><p>
   What the Scripture speaks<note n="speaketh">Auto-modernized</note> to these particulars, shall briefly be
   considered: 
				</p><p>
   1st. For the fountain of his coming, it is mentioned, <reference osisRef="John.15.26">John 15:26</reference>, Para
   tou Patros ekporeuetai, -- "He proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> from the Father;" this is the
   fountain of this dispensation, he proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> from the Father. Now there
   is a twofold ekporeusis, or "procession" of the Spirit: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) Phusike or hupostatike, in respect of substance and personality.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) Oikonomike or dispensatory, in respect of the work of grace.
				</p><p>
   Of the first -- in which respect he is the Spirit of the Father and the
   Son, proceeding from both eternally, so receiving his substance and
   personality -- I speak not: it is a business of another nature than
   that I have now in hand. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, indeed, lies the first and most
   remote foundation of all our distinct communion with him and our
   worship of him; but because abiding in the naked consideration of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>,
   we can make no other progress than the bare acquiescence of faith in
   the mystery revealed, with the performance of that which is due to the
   person solely on the account of his participation of the essence, I
   shall not at present dwell upon it.
				</p><p>
   His ekporeusis or proceeding, mentioned in the place insisted on, is
   his economical or dispensatory proceeding, for the carrying on of the
   work of grace. It is spoken of him in reference to his being sent by
   Christ after his ascension: "I will send him which proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note>," --
   namely, "then when I send him." As God is said to "come out of his
   place," <reference osisRef="Isa.26.21">Isaiah 26:21</reference>, not in regard of any mutation in him, but of the
   new work which he would effect; so it follows, the Lord comes out of
   his place "to punish the inhabitants of the earth." And it is in
   reference to a peculiar work that he is said to proceed, -- namely, to
   testify of Christ: which cannot be assigned to him in respect of his
   eternal procession, but of his actual dispensation; as it is said of
   Christ, "He came forth from God." The single mention of the Father in
   this place, and not of the Son, belongs to the gradation before
   mentioned, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> our Saviour discovers this mystery to his disciples.
   He speaks as much concerning himself, <reference osisRef="John.16.7">John 16:7</reference> And this relation ad
   extra (as they call it) of the Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father and the Son, in
   respect of operation, proves his relation ad intra, in respect of
   personal procession; of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> I spake before.
				</p><p>
   Three things are considerable in the foundation of this dispensation,
   in reference to our communion with the Holy Ghost: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] That the will of the Spirit is in the work: Ekporeuetai, -- "He
   comes forth himself." Frequent mention is made (as we shall see
   afterward) of his being sent, his being given, and poured out; [but]
   that it might not be thus apprehended, either that this Spirit were
   altogether an inferior, created spirit, a mere servant, as some have
   blasphemed, nor yet merely and principally, as to his personality, the
   virtue of God, as some have fancied, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> idiomata hupostatika,
   personal properties, applied to him in this work, arguing his
   personality and liberty. Ekporeuetai, -- "He, of himself and of his own
   accord, proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note>."
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] The condescension of the Holy Ghost in this order of working,
   this dispensation, to proceed from the Father and the Son, as to this
   work; to take upon him this work of a Comforter, as the Son did the
   work of a Redeemer: of which afterward.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] The fountain of the whole is discovered to be the Father, that
   we may know his works in the pursuit of electing love, which everywhere
   is ascribed to the Father. This is the order here intimated:  First,
   there is the prothesis of the Father, or the purpose of his love, the
   fountain of all; then the erotesis, the asking of the Son, <reference osisRef="John.14.16">John 14:16</reference>, which takes in his merit and purchase; to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> follows
   ekporeusis, or willing proceeding of the Holy Ghost. And this gives
   testimony, also, to the foundation of this whole discourse, -- namely,
   our peculiar communion with the Father in love, the Son in grace, and
   the Holy Ghost in consolation. This is the door and entrance of that
   fellowship of the Holy Ghost to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> we are called. His gracious and
   blessed will, his infinite and ineffable condescension, being eyed by
   faith as the foundation of all those effects which he works in us, and
   privileges of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> by him we are made partakers, our souls are
   peculiarly conversant with him, and their desires, affections, and
   thankfulness, terminated on him: of which more afterward. This is the
   first thing considerable in our communion with the Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   2dly. The manner of his collation or bestowing, or the manner of his
   communication to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us from this fountain, is in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> also considerable;
   and it is variously expressed, to denote three things: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The freeness of it: thus he is said to be given, <reference osisRef="John.14.16">John 14:16</reference>;
   "He shall give you another Comforter." I need not multiply places to
   this purpose. The most frequent adjunct of the communication of the
   Spirit is this, that he is given and received as of gift: "He will give
   his Holy Spirit to them that ask him." That which is of gift is free.
   The Spirit of grace is given of grace: and not only the Spirit of
   sanctification, or the Spirit to sanctify and convert us, is a gift of
   free grace, but in the sense of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak, in respect of
   consolation, he is of gift also; he is promised to be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   believers. [354] Hence the Spirit is said to be received by the gospel,
   not by the law, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.2">Galatians 3:2</reference>; that is, of mere grace, and not of our own
   procuring. And all his workings are called charismata, -- "free
   donations." He is freely bestowed, and freely works; and the different
   measures in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is received, for those ends and purposes of
   consolation which we shall consider, by believers, which are great,
   various, and inexpressible, arise from hence, that we have him by
   donation, or free gift. And this is the tenure through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we hold and
   enjoy him, a tenure of free donation. So is he to be eyed, so to be
   asked, so to be received. And this, also, faith takes in and closes
   withal, in our communion with the Comforter:  the union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note> and
   accord of his will with the gift of Father and Son; the one respecting
   the distinct operation of the Deity in the person of the Holy Ghost;
   the other, the economy of the whole Trinity in the work of our
   salvation by Jesus Christ. Here the soul rejoices<note n="rejoiceth">Auto-modernized</note> itself in the
   Comforter, -- that he is willing to come to him, that he is willing to
   be given him. And seeing all is will and gift, grace is magnified on
   this account.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) The authority of it. Thence he is said to be sent. Chap. xiv.
   26, "The Father will send him in my name;" and, chap. xv. 26, "I will
   send him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you from the Father;" and, "Him will I send to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you,"
   chap. xvi. 7. This mission of the Holy Ghost by the Father and the Son,
   as it answers the order of the persons' subsistence in the blessed
   Trinity, and his procession from them both, so the order voluntarily
   engaged in by them for the accomplishment, as was said, of the work of
   our salvation. There is in it, in a most special manner, the
   condescension of the Holy Ghost, in his love to us, to the
   authoritative delegation of Father and Son in this business; which
   argues not a disparity, dissimilitude, or inequality of essence, but of
   office, in this work. It is the office of the Holy Ghost to be an
   advocate for us, and a comforter to us; in which respect, not
   absolutely, he is thus sent authoritatively by Father and Son. It is a
   known maxim, that "inaequalitas officii non tollit aequalitatem
   naturae." This subjection (if I may so call it), or inequality in
   respect of office, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> no ways prejudice the equality of nature which
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> with Father and Son; no more than the mission of the Son by the
   Father does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> his. And on this authoritative mission of the Spirit does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   the right apprehension of many mysteries in the gospel, and the
   ordering of our hearts in communion with him, depend.
				</p><p>
   [1st.] Hence is the sin against the Holy Ghost (what it is I do not now
   dispute) unpardonable, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> that adjunct of rebellion put upon it
   that no other sin has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, -- namely, because he comes not, he acts not,
   in his own name only, though in his own also, but in the name and
   authority of the Father and Son, from and by whom he is sent; and
   therefore, to sin against him is to sin against all the authority of
   God, all the love of the Trinity, and the utmost condescension of each
   person to the work of our salvation. It is, I say, from the
   authoritative mission of the Spirit that the sin against him is
   peculiarly unpardonable; -- it is a sin against the recapitulation of
   the love of the Father, Son, and Spirit. And from this consideration,
   were that our present business, might the true nature of the sin
   against the Holy Ghost be investigated. Certainly it must consist in
   the contempt of some operation of his, as acting in the name and
   authority of the whole Trinity, and that in their ineffable
   condescension to the work of grace. But this is of another
   consideration.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] On this account we are to pray the Father and the Son to give
   the Spirit to us. <reference osisRef="Luke.11.13">Luke 11:13</reference>, "Your heavenly Father will give the Holy
   Spirit to them that ask him." Now the Holy Ghost, being God, is no less
   to be invocated, prayed to, and called on, than the Father and Son; as
   elsewhere I have proved. How, then, do we ask the Father for him, as we
   do in all our supplications, seeing that we also pray that he himself
   would come to us, visit us, and abide with us? In our prayers that are
   directed to himself, we consider him as essentially God over all,
   blessed for evermore; we pray for him from the Father and Son, as under
   this mission and delegation from them. And, indeed, God having most
   plentifully revealed himself in the order of this dispensation to us,
   we are (as Christians generally do) in our communion to abound in
   answerable addresses; that is, not only to the person of the Holy Ghost
   himself, but properly to the Father and Son for him, which refers to
   this dispensation.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] Hence is that great weight, in particular, laid upon our not
   grieving the Spirit, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.30">Ephesians 4:30</reference>, -- because he comes to us in the
   name, with the love, and upon the condescension, of the whole blessed
   Trinity. To do that which might grieve him so sent, on such an account,
   for that end and purpose which shall afterward be mentioned, is a great
   aggravation of sin. He expects cheerful entertainment with us, and may
   do so justly, upon his own account, and the account of the work which
   he comes about; but when this also is added, that he is sent of the
   Father and the Son, commissioned with their love and grace, to
   communicate them to their souls, -- this is that which is, or ought to
   be, of unspeakable esteem with believers. And this is that second thing
   expressed in the manner of his communication, -- he is sent by
   authority.
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) He is said to be poured out or shed on us, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.6">Titus 3:6</reference>, Hou
   execheen eph' hemas plousios, -- that Holy Ghost which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> richly
   poured out upon us, or shed on us abundantly. And this was the chief
   expression of his communication under the Old Testament; the mystery of
   the Father and the Son, and the matter of commission and delegation
   being then not so clearly discovered. <reference osisRef="Isa.32.15">Isaiah 32:15</reference>, "Until the Spirit
   be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field,
   and the fruitful field be counted for a forest;" that is, till the
   Gentiles be called, and the Jews rejected. And chap. xliv. 3, "I will
   pour my Spirit upon your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> seed, and my blessing upon your<note n="thine">Auto-modernized</note> offspring."
   That eminent place of <reference osisRef="Zech.12.10">Zechariah 12:10</reference> is always in our thoughts. Now,
   this expression, as is known, is taken from the allusion of the Spirit
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> water; and that in relation to all the uses of water, both natural
   and typical. A particular relation of them I cannot now insist on;
   perhaps efficacy and plenty are chiefly intended.
				</p><p>
   Now, this threefold expression, of giving, sending, and pouring out, of
   the Spirit, gives us the three great properties of the covenant of
   grace:  First, That it is free; he is given. Secondly, That it is
   orderly, ordered in all things, and sure, from the love of the Father,
   by the procurement of the Son; and thence is that variety of
   expression, of the Father's sending him, and the Son's sending him from
   the Father, he being the gift of the Father's love, and purchase of the
   blood of the Son. Thirdly. The efficacy of it, as was last observed.
   And this is the second thing considerable.
				</p><p>
   3dly. The third, which is our receiving him, I shall speak more briefly
   of. That which I first proposed of the Spirit, considered as a Spirit
   of sanctification and a Spirit of consolation, is here to be minded.
   Our receiving of him as a Spirit of sanctification is a mere passive
   reception, as a vessel receives water. He comes as the wind on
   Ezekiel's dead bones, and makes them live; he comes into dead hearts,
   and quickens them, by an act of his almighty power: but now, as he is
   the Spirit of consolation, it is otherwise. In this sense our Saviour
   tells us that the "world cannot receive him," <reference osisRef="John.14.17">John 14:17</reference>, "The world
   receives<note n="receiveth">Auto-modernized</note> him not, because it sees<note n="seeth">Auto-modernized</note> him not, neither knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> him: but
   ye know him, for he dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> with you, and shall be in you." That it is
   the Spirit of consolation, or the Spirit for consolation, that here is
   promised, is evident from the close of the verse, where he is said then
   to be in them when he is promised to them. He was in them as a Spirit
   of quickening and sanctification when promised to them as a Spirit of
   comfort and consolation, to abide with them for that purpose. Now, the
   power that is here denied to be in the world, with the reason of it,
   that they cannot receive the Spirit, because they know him not, is
   ascribed to believers; -- they can receive him, because they know him.
   So that there is an active power to be put forth in his reception for
   consolation, though not in his reception for regeneration and
   sanctification. And this is the power of faith. So <reference osisRef="Gal.3.2">Galatians 3:2</reference>, they
   received the Spirit by the hearing of faith; -- the preaching of the
   gospel, begetting faith in them, enabled them to receive the Spirit.
   Hence, believing is put as the qualification of all our receiving the
   Holy Ghost. <reference osisRef="John.7.39">John 7:39</reference>, "This he spake of the Spirit, which they that
   believe on him should receive." It is believers that thus receive the
   Spirit; and they receive him by faith. Now, there are three special
   acts of faith, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it goes forth in the receiving of the Spirit. I
   shall but name them: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) It considers the Spirit, in the economy before described, as
   promised. It is faith alone that makes profit of the benefit of the
   promises, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.2">Hebrews 4:2</reference> Now he is called the Spirit of that promise, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.13">Ephesians 1:13</reference>, -- the Spirit that in the covenant is promised; and we receive
   the promise of the Spirit through faith, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.14">Galatians 3:14</reference>: so that the
   receiving of the Spirit through faith, is the receiving of him as
   promised. Faith eyes the promise of God and of Jesus Christ, of sending
   the Spirit for all those ends that he is desired; thus it depends,
   waits, mixing the promise with itself, until it receive him.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) By prayer. He is given as a Spirit of supplication, that we may
   ask him as a Spirit of consolation, <reference osisRef="Luke.11.13">Luke 11:13</reference>; and, indeed, this
   asking of the Spirit of God, in the name of Christ, either directly or
   immediately, or under the name of some fruit and effect; of him, is the
   chiefest work of faith in this world.
				</p><p>
   (3dly.) It cherishes<note n="cherisheth">Auto-modernized</note> him, by attending to his motions, improving his
   actings according to his mind and will; which is all I shall say to
   this third thing, or our receiving of the Spirit, which is sent of
   Jesus Christ. We do it by faith, looking on him as purchased by Jesus
   Christ, and promised of the Father; we seek him at the hands of God,
   and do receive him.
				</p><p>
   4thly. The next considerable thing is, his abode with us. Now this is
   two ways expressed in the Scripture: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) In general. As to the thing itself, it is said he shall abide
   with us.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) In particular. As to the manner of its abiding, it is by
   inhabitation or indwelling. Of the inhabitation of the Spirit I have
   spoken fully [355] elsewhere, nor shall I now insist on it. Only
   whereas the Spirit, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been observed, is considered as a Spirit of
   sanctification, or a Spirit of consolation, he is said to dwell in us
   chiefly, or perhaps solely, as he is a Spirit of sanctification: which
   is evident from the work he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, as indwelling, -- he quickens<note n="quickeneth">Auto-modernized</note> and
   sanctifies<note n="sanctifieth">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.11">Romans 8:11</reference>; and the manner of his indwelling, -- as in
   a temple, which he makes holy thereby, <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.19">1 Corinthians 6:19</reference>; and his
   permanency in his so doing, -- which, as is evident, relates to
   sanctification only: but yet the general notion of it in abiding is
   ascribed to him as a comforter, <reference osisRef="John.14.16">John 14:16</reference>, "He shall abide with you
   for ever." Now, all the difficulty of this promise lies in this, that
   whereas the Spirit of sanctification dwells in us always, and it is
   therefore impossible that we should lose utterly our holiness, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>
   is it that, if the Comforter abide with us for ever, we may yet utterly
   lose our comfort? A little to clear this in our passage: 
				</p><p>
   [1st.] He is promised to abide with the disciples for ever, in
   opposition to the abode of Christ. Christ, in the flesh, had been with
   them for a little while, and now was leaving them, and going to his
   Father. He had been the comforter immediately himself for a season, but
   is now upon his departing; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, promising them another comforter,
   they might fear that he would even but visit them for a little season
   also, and then their condition would be worse than ever. Nay, but says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>
   our Saviour, "Fear it not: this is the last dispensation; there is to
   be no alteration. When I am gone, the Comforter is to do all the
   remaining work: there is not another to be looked for, and I promise
   you him; nor shall he depart from you, but always abide with you."
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] The Comforter may always abide with us, though not always
   comfort us; he who is the Comforter may abide, though he do not always
   that work. For other ends and purposes he is always with us; as to
   sanctify and make us holy. So was the case with David, <reference osisRef="Ps.51.11-Ps.51.12">Psalms 51:11-12</reference>,
   "Take not your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Holy Spirit from me." The Holy Spirit of sanctification
   was still with David; but says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "Restore to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me the joy of your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note>
   salvation;" -- that is, the Spirit of consolation, that was lost, when
   the promise was made good in the abode of the other.
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] The Comforter may abide as a comforter, when he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   actually comfort the soul. In truth, as to the essence of holiness, he
   cannot dwell in us but withal he must make us holy; for the temple of
   God is holy; -- but as to his comforting, his actings in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> are all
   of his sovereign will; so that he may abide, and yet not actually
   comfort us.
				</p><p>
   [4thly.] The Spirit often works for it, and tenders consolation to us,
   when we do not receive it; the well is nigh, and we see it not, -- we
   refuse to be comforted. I told you that the Spirit as a sanctifier
   comes with power, to conquer an unbelieving heart; the Spirit as a
   comforter comes with sweetness, to be received in a believing heart. He
   speaks, and we believe not that it is his voice; he tenders the things
   of consolation, and we receive them not. "My sore ran," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> David,
   "and my soul refused to be comforted."
				</p><p>
   [5thly.] I deny that ever the Holy Spirit does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> absolutely and
   universally leave a believing soul without consolation. A man may be
   darkened, clouded, refuse comfort, -- actually find none, feel none;
   but radically he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a foundation of consolation, which in due time
   will be drawn forth: and therefore, when God promises that he will heal
   sinners, and restore comfort to them, as <reference osisRef="Isa.57.18">Isaiah 57:18</reference>, it is not that
   they were without any, but that they had not so much as they needed,
   that that promise is made. To insist on the several ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> men
   refuse comfort, and come short of the strong consolation which God is
   willing that we should receive, is not my purpose at present. Thus,
   then, the Spirit being sent and given, abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note> with the souls of
   believers, -- leaves them not, though he variously manifest himself in
   his operations: of which in the next place.
</p>

<title>Part 3 Chapter 2</title>
<p>
   Of the actings of the Holy Ghost in us, being bestowed on us -- He
   works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> effectually, distributes<note n="distributeth">Auto-modernized</note>, gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Having thus declared from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> and how the Holy Ghost is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us as a Spirit of consolation, I come, in the next place, --
				</p><p>
   5thly. To declare what are his actings in us and towards us, being so
   bestowed on us and received by us. Now, here are two general heads to
   be considered:  (1st.) The manner and kind of his actings in us, which
   are variously expressed; and, (2dly.) The particular products of his
   actings in our souls, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion with him. The first is
   variously expressed; I shall pass through them briefly: 
				</p><p>
   (1st.) He is said (energein) "to work effectually," <reference osisRef="1Cor.12.11">1 Corinthians 12:11</reference>,
   "All these works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note>" (or effects<note n="effecteth">Auto-modernized</note>) "that one and the self-same Spirit."
   It is spoken there, indeed, in respect of his distribution of gifts;
   but the way is the same for the communication of graces and privileges.
   He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it by working: which, as it evinces his personality, especially
   as considered with the words following, "Dividing to every man
   according to his will" (for to work according to will is the
   inseparable property of a person, and is spoken expressly of God, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.11">Ephesians 1:11</reference>); so in relation to verse 6, foregoing, it makes no less evident
   his Deity. What he is here said to do as the Spirit bestowed on us and
   given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, there is he said as God himself to do: "There are
   diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> all in
   all;" which here, in other words, is, "All these works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> that one and
   the self same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will." What
   we have, then, from him, we have by the way of his energetical working.
   It is not by proposing this or that argument to us, persuading us by
   these or those moral motives or inducements alone, leaving us to make
   use of them as we can; but he works effectually himself, what he
   communicates of grace or consolation to us.
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] In the same verse, as to the manner of his operation, he is
   said diairein, -- he divides<note n="divideth">Auto-modernized</note> or distributes<note n="distributeth">Auto-modernized</note> to every one as he will.
   This of distribution adds to that of operation, choice, judgment, and
   freedom. He that distributes variously, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it with choice, and
   judgment, and freedom of will. Such are the proceedings of the Spirit
   in his dispensations: to one, he gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> one thing eminently; to
   another, another; -- to one, in one degree; to another, in another.
   Thus are the saints, in his sovereignty, kept in a constant dependence
   on him. He distributes as he will; -- who should not be content with
   his portion? what claim can any lay to that which he distributes<note n="distributeth">Auto-modernized</note> as he
   will? which is farther manifested, --
				</p><p>
   [3dly.] By his being said to give when and what he bestows. They "spake
   with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance," <reference osisRef="Acts.2.4">Acts 2:4</reference> He
   gave them to them; that is, freely: whatever he bestows upon us, is of
   his gift. And hence it is to be observed, that in the economy of our
   salvation, the acting of no one person does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> prejudice the freedom and
   liberty of any other: so the love of the Father in sending the Son is
   free, and his sending does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> no ways prejudice the liberty and love of
   the Son, but that he lays down his life freely also; so the
   satisfaction and purchase made by the Son does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> no way prejudice the
   freedom of the Father's grace in pardoning and accepting us thereupon;
   so the Father's and Son's sending of the Spirit does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not derogate from
   his freedom in his workings, but he gives freely what he gives. And the
   reason of this is, because the will of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
   is essentially the same; so that in the acting of one there is the
   counsel of all and each freely in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Thus, in general, is the manner and kind of his working in us and
   towards us, being bestowed upon us, described. Power, choice, freedom,
   are evidently denoted in the expressions insisted on. It is not any
   peculiar work of his towards us that is hereby declared, but the manner
   how he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> produce the effects that shall be insisted on.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) That which remains, in the last place, for the explanation of
   the things proposed to be explained as the foundation of the communion
   which we have with the Holy Ghost, is, --
				</p><p>
   The effects that, being thus sent and thus working, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> produce;
   which I shall do, not casting them into any artificial method, but
   taking them up as I find them lying scattered up and down in the
   Scripture, only descending from those which are more general to those
   which are more particular, neither aiming nor desiring to gather all
   the several, but insisting on those which do most obviously occur.
				</p><p>
   Only as formerly, so now you must observe, that I speak of the Spirit
   principally (if not only) as a comforter, and not as a sanctifier; and
   therefore the great work of the Spirit towards us all our days, in the
   constant and continual supplies of new light, power, vigour, as to our
   receiving of grace from him, belonging to that head of sanctification,
   must be omitted.
				</p><p>
   Nor shall I insist on those things which the Comforter does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> in
   believers effect towards others, in his testifying to them and
   convincing of the world, which are promised, <reference osisRef="John.15.26">John 15:26</reference>, xvi. 8,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is properly their advocate; but only on those which as a
   comforter he works in and towards them on whom he is bestowed.
</p>

<title>Part 3 Chapter 3</title>
<p>
   Of the things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have communion with the Holy Ghost -- He
   brings to remembrance the things spoken by Christ, <reference osisRef="John.14.26">John 14:26</reference> -- The
   manner how he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it -- The Spirit glorifies Christ in the hearts of
   believers, <reference osisRef="John.16.14">John 16:14</reference>, sheds abroad the love of God in them -- The
   witness of the Spirit, what it is, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.16">Romans 8:16</reference> -- The sealing of the
   Spirit, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.13">Ephesians 1:13</reference> -- The Spirit, how an earnest; on the part of God,
   on the part of the saints -- Difference between the earnest of the
   Spirit and tasting of the powers of the world to come -- Unction by the
   Spirit, <reference osisRef="Isa.11.2-Isa.11.3">Isaiah 11:2-3</reference> -- The various teachings of the Holy Ghost -- How
   the Spirit of adoption and of supplication.
				</p><p>
   The things which, in the foregoing chapters, I called effects of the
   Holy Ghost in us, or towards us, are the subject-matter of our
   communion with him, or the things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we hold peculiar fellowship
   with him as our comforter. These are now proposed to consideration: 
				</p><p>
   1. The first and most general is that of <reference osisRef="John.14.26">John 14:26</reference>, "He shall teach
   you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I
   have said to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you." There are two parts of this promise:  (1.) Of
   teaching. (2.) Of bringing to remembrance. Of his teaching I shall
   speak afterward, when I come to treat of his anointing us.
				</p><p>
   His bringing the things to remembrance that Christ spake is the first
   general promise of him as a comforter: Hupomnesei humas panta, -- "He
   shall make you mind all these things." Now, this also may be considered
   two ways: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] Merely in respect of the things spoken themselves. So our Saviour
   here promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> his apostles that the Holy Ghost should bring to their
   minds, by an immediate efficacy, the things that he had spoken, that by
   his inspiration they might be enabled to write and preach them for the
   good and benefit of his church. So Peter tells us, 2 Epist. i. 21,
   "Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (that is,
   in writing the Scripture); hupo Pneumatos hagiou pheromenoi, -- borne
   up by him, carried beyond themselves, to speak his words, and what he
   indited to them. The apostles forgot much of what Christ had said to
   them, or might do so; and what they did retain, in a natural way of
   remembrance, was not a sufficient foundation to them to write what they
   so remembered for a rule of faith to the church. For the word of
   prophecy is not idias epiluseos, -- from any man's proper impulse; it
   comes not from any private conception, understanding, or remembrance.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, Christ promises that the Holy Ghost shall do this work; that
   they might infallibly give out what he had delivered to them. Hence
   that expression in <reference osisRef="Luke.1.3">Luke 1:3</reference>, Purekolouthekoti anothen, is better
   rendered, "Having obtained perfect knowledge of things from above," --
   noting the rise and spring of his so understanding things as to be able
   infallibly to give them out in a rule of faith to the church, than the
   beginning of the things themselves spoken of; which the word itself
   will not easily allow of.
				</p><p>
   [2.] In respect of the comfort of what he had spoken, which seems to be
   a great part of the intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of this promise. He had been speaking to
   them things suited for their consolation; giving them precious promises
   of the supplies they should have from him in this life, -- of the love
   of the Father, of the glory he was providing for them, the sense and
   comfort of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is unspeakable, and the joy arising from them full of
   glory. But says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "I know how unable you are to make use of these
   things for your own consolation; the Spirit, therefore, shall recover
   them upon your minds, in their full strength and vigour, for that end
   for which I speak them." And this is one cause why it was expedient for
   believers that Christ's bodily absence should be supplied by the
   presence of the Spirit. While<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> he was with them, how little efficacy on
   their hearts had any of the heavenly promises he gave them! When the
   Spirit came, how full of joy did he make all things to them! That which
   was his peculiar work, which belonged to him by virtue of his office,
   that he also might be glorified, was reserved for him. And this is his
   work to the end of the world, -- to bring the promises of Christ to our
   minds and hearts, to give us the comfort of them, the joy and sweetness
   of them, much beyond that which the disciples found in them, when
   Christ in person spake them to them; their gracious influence being
   then restrained, that, as was said, the dispensation of the Spirit
   might be glorified. So are the next words to this promise, verse 27,
   "Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you." The Comforter being
   sent to bring what Christ said to remembrance, the consequent of it is
   peace, and freedom from trouble of heart; -- whatever peace, relief,
   comfort, joy, support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note>, we have at any time received from any work,
   promise, or thing done by Christ, it all belongs to this dispensation
   of the Comforter. In vain should we apply our natural abilities to
   remember, call to mind, consider, the promises of Christ; without
   success would it be, -- it is so daily: but when the Comforter does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   undertake the work, it is done to the purpose. How we have peculiar
   communion with him in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, in faith and obedience, in the consolation
   received in and by the promises of him brought to mind, shall be
   afterward declared. This, in general, is obtained:  our Saviour Jesus
   Christ, leaving the efficacy even of those promises which in person he
   gave to his apostles in their great distress, as to their consolation,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Ghost, we may see the immediate spring of all the
   spiritual comfort we have in this world, and the fellowship which we
   have with the Holy Ghost in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Only here, as in all the particulars following, the manner of the
   Spirit's working this thing is always to be borne in mind, and the
   interest of his power, will, and goodness in his working. He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this,
   -- 1st. Powerfully, or effectually; 2dly. Voluntarily; 3dly. Freely.
				</p><p>
   1st. Powerfully: and therefore does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> comfort from the words and promises
   of Christ sometimes break in through all opposition into the saddest
   and darkest condition imaginable; it comes and makes men sing in a
   dungeon, rejoice in flames, glory in tribulation; it will into prisons,
   racks, through temptations, and the greatest distresses imaginable.
   From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is this? To Pneuma energei, -- the Spirit works effectually, his
   power is in it; he will work, and none shall let him. If he will bring
   to our remembrance the promises of Christ for our consolation, neither
   Satan nor man, sin nor world, nor death, shall interrupt our comfort.
   This the saints, who have communion with the Holy Ghost, know to their
   advantage. Sometimes the heavens are black over them, and the earth
   trembles under them; public, personal calamities and distresses appear
   so full of horror and darkness, that they are ready to faint with the
   apprehensions of them; -- hence is their great relief, and the
   retrievement of their spirits; their consolation or trouble depends not
   on any outward condition or inward frame of their own hearts, but on
   the powerful and effectual workings of the Holy Ghost, which by faith
   they give themselves up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   2dly. Voluntarily, -- distributing to every one as he will; and
   therefore is this work done in so great variety, both as to the same
   person and divers. For the same person, full of joy sometimes in a
   great distress, full of consolation, -- every promise brings sweetness
   when his pressures are great and heavy; another time, in the least
   trial [he] seeks for comfort, searches the promise, and it is far away.
   The reason is, Pneuma diairei kathos bouletai, -- the Spirit
   distributes as he will. And so with divers persons: to some each
   promise is full of life and comfort; others taste little all their
   days, -- all upon the same account. And this faith especially regards
   in the whole business of consolation:  it depends on the sovereign
   will of the Holy Ghost; and so is not tied to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any rules or course of
   procedure. Therefore does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it exercise itself in waiting upon him for
   the seasonable accomplishment of the good pleasure of his will.
				</p><p>
   3dly. Freely. Much of the variety of the dispensation of consolation by
   promises depends on this freedom of the Spirit's operation. Hence it is
   that comfort is given unexpectedly, when the heart has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> all the reasons
   in the world to look for distress and sorrow; thus sometimes it is the
   first means of recovering a backsliding soul, who might justly expect
   to be utterly cast off. And these considerations are to be carried on
   in all the other effects and fruits of the Comforter: of which
   afterward. And in this first general effect or work of the Holy Ghost
   towards us have we communion and fellowship with him. The life and soul
   of all our comforts lie treasured up in the promises of Christ. They
   are the breasts of all our consolation. Who knows not how powerless
   they are in the bare letter, even when improved to the uttermost by our
   considerations of them, and meditation on them? as also how
   unexpectedly they sometimes break upon the soul with a conquering,
   endearing life and vigour? Here faith deals peculiarly with the Holy
   Ghost. It considers the promises themselves; looks up to him, waits for
   him, considers his appearances in the word depended on, -- owns him in
   his work and efficacy. No sooner does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the soul begin to feel the life
   of a promise warming his heart, relieving, cherishing, supporting,
   delivering from fear, entanglements, or troubles, but it may, it ought,
   to know that the Holy Ghost is there; which will add to his joy, and
   lead him into fellowship with him.
				</p><p>
   2. The next general work seems to be that of <reference osisRef="John.16.14">John 16:14</reference>, "The
   Comforter shall glorify me; for he shall receive of mine, and shall
   show it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you." The work of the Spirit is to glorify Christ: from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>,
   by the way, we may see how far that spirit is from being the Comforter
   who sets up himself in the room of Christ; such a spirit as says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he is
   all himself: "for as for him that suffered at Jerusalem, it is no
   matter that we trouble ourselves about him." This spirit is now all.
   This is not the Comforter. His work is to glorify Christ, -- him that
   sends him. And this is an evident sign of a false spirit, whatever its
   pretence be, if it glorify not that Christ who was now speaking to his
   apostles; and such are many that are gone abroad into the world. But
   what shall this Spirit do, that Christ may be glorified? "He shall,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "take of mine," -- ek tou emou lepsetai. What these things
   are is declared in the next verse: "All things that the Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> are
   mine; therefore I said he shall take of mine." It is not of the essence
   and essential properties of the Father and Son that our Saviour speaks;
   but of the grace which is communicated to us by them. This Christ
   calls, "My things," being the fruit of his purchase and mediation: on
   which account he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> all his Father's things are his; that is, the
   things that the Father, in his eternal love, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided to be
   dispensed in the blood of his Son, -- all the fruits of election.
   "These," said he, "the Comforter shall receive; that is, they shall be
   committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him to dispose for your good and advantage, to the end
   before proposed." So it follows, anangelei, -- "He shall show, or
   declare and make them known to you." Thus, then, is he a comforter. He
   reveals to the souls of sinners the good things of the covenant of
   grace, which the Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided, and the Son purchased. He shows
   to us mercy, grace, forgiveness, righteousness, acceptation with God;
   lets<note n="letteth">Auto-modernized</note> us know that these are the things of Christ, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   procured for us; shows them to us for our comfort and establishment.
   These things, I say, he effectually declares to the souls of believers;
   and makes them know them for their own good, -- know them as originally
   the things of the Father, prepared from eternity in his love and
   good-will; as purchased for them by Christ, and laid up in store in the
   covenant of grace for their use. Then is Christ magnified and glorified
   in their hearts; then they know what a Saviour and Redeemer he is. A
   soul does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> never glorify or honour Christ upon a discovery or sense of
   the eternal redemption he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> purchased for him, but it is in him a
   peculiar effect of the Holy Ghost as our comforter. "No man can say
   that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost," <reference osisRef="1Cor.12.3">1 Corinthians 12:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   3. He "sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.5">Romans 5:5</reference> That it
   is the love of God to us, not our love to God, which is here intended,
   the context is so clear as nothing can be added to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Now, the
   love of God is either of ordination or of acceptation, -- the love of
   his purpose to do us good, or the love of acceptation and approbation
   with him. Both these are called the love of God frequently in
   Scripture, as I have declared. Now, how can these be shed abroad in our
   hearts? Not in themselves, but in a sense of them, -- in a spiritual
   apprehension of them. Ekkechutai, is "shed abroad;" the same word that
   is used concerning the Comforter being given us, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.6">Titus 3:6</reference> God sheds
   him abundantly, or pours him on us; so he sheds abroad, or pours out
   the love of God in our hearts. Not to insist on the expression, which
   is metaphorical, the business is, that the Comforter gives a sweet and
   plentiful evidence and persuasion of the love of God to us, such as the
   soul is taken, delighted, satiated withal. This is his work, and he
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it effectually. To give a poor sinful soul a comfortable
   persuasion, affecting it throughout, in all its faculties and
   affections, that God in Jesus Christ loves him, delights in him, is
   well pleased with him, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> thoughts of tenderness and kindness towards
   him; to give, I say, a soul an overflowing sense of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, is an
   inexpressible mercy.
				</p><p>
   This we have in a peculiar manner by the Holy Ghost; it is his peculiar
   work. As all his works are works of love and kindness, so this of
   communicating a sense of the love of the Father mixes itself with all
   the particulars of his actings. And as we have in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> peculiar
   communion with himself, so by him we have communion with the Father,
   even in his love, which is thus shed abroad in our hearts: so not only
   do we rejoice in, and glorify the Holy Ghost, which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this work, but
   in him also whose love it is. Thus is it also in respect of the Son, in
   his taking of his, and showing of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as was declared. What we
   have of heaven in this world lies in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>; and the manner of our
   fellowship with the Holy Ghost on this account falls in with what was
   spoken before.
				</p><p>
   4. Another effect we have of his, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.16">Romans 8:16</reference>, "The Spirit itself
   bears<note n="beareth">Auto-modernized</note> witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God." You
   know whose children we are by nature, -- children of Satan and of the
   curse, or of wrath. By the Spirit we are put into another capacity, and
   are adopted to be the children of God, inasmuch as by receiving the
   Spirit of our Father we become the children of our Father. Thence is he
   called, verse 15, "The Spirit of adoption." Now, sometimes the soul,
   because it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> somewhat remaining in it of the principle that it had
   in its old condition, is put to question whether it be a child of God
   or no; and thereupon, as in a thing of the greatest importance, puts in
   its claim, with all the evidences that it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to make good its title.
   The Spirit comes and bears witness in this case. An allusion it is to
   judicial proceedings in point of titles and evidences. The judge being
   set, the person concerned lays his claim, produces<note n="produceth">Auto-modernized</note> his evidences, and
   pleads them; his adversaries endeavouring all that in them lies to
   invalidate them, and disannul his plea, and to cast him in his claim.
   In the midst of the trial, a person of known and approved integrity
   comes into the court, and gives testimony fully and directly on the
   behalf of the claimer; which stops the mouths of all his adversaries,
   and fills the man that pleaded with joy and satisfaction. So is it in
   this case. The soul, by the power of its own conscience, is brought
   before the law of God. There a man puts in his plea, -- that he is a
   child of God, that he belongs to God's family; and for this end
   produces<note n="produceth">Auto-modernized</note> all his evidences, every thing through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> faith gives him an
   interest in God. Satan, in the meantime, opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note> with all his might;
   sin and law assist him; many flaws are found in his evidences; the
   truth of them all is questioned; and the soul hangs in suspense as to
   the issue. In the midst of the plea and contest the Comforter comes,
   and, by a word of promise or otherwise, overpowers the heart with a
   comfortable persuasion (and bears down all objections) that his plea is
   good, and that he is a child of God. And therefore it is said of him,
   Summarturei to Pneumati hemon. When our spirits are pleading their
   right and title, he comes in and bears witness on our side; at the same
   time enabling us to put forth acts of filial obedience, kind and
   childlike; which is called "crying, Abba, Father," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference> Remember
   still the manner of the Spirit's working, before mentioned, -- that he
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it effectually, voluntarily, and freely. Hence sometimes the
   dispute hangs long, -- the cause is pleading many years. The law seems
   sometimes to prevail, sin and Satan to rejoice; and the poor soul is
   filled with dread about its inheritance. Perhaps its own witness, from
   its faith, sanctification, former experience, keeps up the plea with
   some life and comfort; but the work is not done, the conquest is not
   fully obtained, until the Spirit, who works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> freely and effectually,
   when and how he will, comes in with his testimony also; clothing his
   power with a word of promise, he makes all parties concerned to attend
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and puts an end to the controversy.
				</p><p>
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he gives us holy communion with himself. The soul knows his
   voice when he speaks, "Nec hominem sonat." There is something too great
   in it to be the effect of a created power. When the Lord Jesus Christ
   at one word stilled the raging of the sea and wind, all that were with
   him knew there was divine power at hand, <reference osisRef="Matt.8.25-Matt.8.27">Matthew 8:25-27</reference> And when
   the Holy Ghost by one word stills the tumults and storms that are
   raised in the soul, giving it an immediate calm and security, it knows
   his divine power, and rejoices in his presence.
				</p><p>
   5. He seals us. "We are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.13">Ephesians 1:13</reference>; and, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> ye are sealed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   day of redemption," chap. iv. 30. I am not very clear in the certain
   peculiar intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of this metaphor; what I am persuaded of the mind
   of God in it I shall briefly impart. In a seal two things are
   considered:  (1.) The nature of it. (2.) The use of it.
				</p><p>
   (1.) The nature of sealing consists in the imparting of the image or
   character of the seal to the thing sealed. This is to seal a thing, --
   to stamp the character of the seal on it. In this sense, the effectual
   communication of the image of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us should be our sealing. The
   Spirit in believers, really communicating the image of God, in
   righteousness and true holiness, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the soul, seals<note n="sealeth">Auto-modernized</note> us. To have
   this stamp of the Holy Ghost, so as to be an evidence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the soul
   that it is accepted with God, is to be sealed by the Spirit; taking the
   metaphor from the nature of sealing. [356] And in this sense is our
   Saviour said to be sealed of God, <reference osisRef="John.6.27">John 6:27</reference>, even from that
   impression of the power, wisdom, and majesty of God that he had upon
   him in the discharge of his office.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The end of sealing is twofold: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] To confirm or ratify any grant or conveyance made in writing. In
   such cases men set their seals to make good and confirm their grants;
   and when this is done they are irrevocable. Or to confirm the testimony
   that is given by any one of the truth of any thing. Such was the manner
   among the Jews:  when any one had given true witness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any thing or
   matter, and it was received by the judges, they instantly set their
   seals to it, to confirm it in judgment. Hence it is said, that he who
   receives the testimony of Christ "sets to his seal that God is true,"
   <reference osisRef="John.3.33">John 3:33</reference> The promise is the great grant and conveyance of life and
   salvation in Christ to the souls of believers. That we may have full
   assurance of the truth and irrevocableness of the promise, God gives us
   the Spirit to satisfy our hearts of it; and thence is he said to seal
   us, by assuring our hearts of those promises and their stability. But,
   though many expositors go this way, I do not see how this can consist
   with the very meaning of the word. It is not said that the promise is
   sealed, but that we are sealed; and when we seal a deed or grant to any
   one, we do not say the man is sealed, but the deed or grant.
				</p><p>
   [2.] To appropriate, distinguish, or keep safe. This is the end of
   sealing. Men set their seals on that which they appropriate and desire
   to keep safe for themselves. So, evidently, in this sense are the
   servants of God said to be sealed, <reference osisRef="Rev.7.4">Revelation of John 7:4</reference>; that is, marked with
   God's mark, as his peculiar ones, -- for this sealing answers to the
   setting of a mark, <reference osisRef="Ezek.9.4">Ezekiel 9:4</reference> Then are believers sealed, when they
   are marked for God to be heirs of the purchased inheritance, and to be
   preserved to the day of redemption. Now, if this be the sealing
   intended, it denotes not an act of sense in the heart, but of security
   to the person. The Father gives the elect into the hands of Christ to
   be redeemed; having redeemed them, in due time they are called by the
   Spirit, and marked for God, and so give up themselves to the hands of
   the Father.
				</p><p>
   If you ask, now, "Which of these senses is chiefly intended in this
   expression of our being sealed by the Holy Ghost?" I answer, The first,
   not excluding the other. We are sealed to the day of redemption, when,
   from the stamp, image, and character of the Spirit upon our souls, we
   have a fresh sense of the love of God given to us, with a comfortable
   persuasion of our acceptation with him. But of this whole matter I have
   treated at large [357] elsewhere.
				</p><p>
   Thus, then, the Holy Ghost communicates to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us his own likeness; which
   is also the image of the Father and the Son. "We are changed into this
   image by the Lord the Spirit," <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>; and in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he brings us
   into fellowship with himself. Our likeness to him gives us boldness
   with him. His work we look for, his fruits we pray for; and when any
   effect of grace, any discovery of the image of Christ implanted in us,
   gives us a persuasion of our being separated and set apart for God, we
   have a communion with him in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   6. He is an earnest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.22">2 Corinthians 1:22</reference>, He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> "given the earnest
   of the Spirit in our hearts;" chap. v. 5, "Who also has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us
   the earnest of the Spirit;" as also, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.13-Eph.1.14">Ephesians 1:13-14</reference>, "Ye are sealed
   with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our
   inheritance." In the two former places we are said to have the earnest
   of the Spirit; in the latter, the Spirit is said to be our earnest: "of
   the Spirit," then, in the first place, is, as we say, "genitivus
   materiae;" denoting not the cause, but the thing itself; -- not the
   author of the earnest, but the matter of it. The Spirit is our earnest;
   as in the last place is expressed. The consideration of what is meant
   by the "Spirit," here, and what is meant by an "earnest," will give
   some insight into this privilege, which we receive by the Comforter: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) What grace, what gift of the Spirit, is intended by this earnest,
   some have made inquiry; I suppose to no purpose. It is the Spirit
   himself, personally considered, that is said to be this earnest, <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.22">2 Corinthians 1:22</reference> It is God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts: an
   expression directly answering that of <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference>, "God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent forth
   the Spirit of his Son into your hearts;" -- that is, the person of the
   Spirit; for nothing else can be called the Spirit of his Son: and in
   <reference osisRef="Eph.1.14">Ephesians 1:14</reference>, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given the Spirit (hos for ho); which is that
   earnest. The Spirit of promise himself is this earnest. In giving us
   this Spirit he gives us this earnest.
				</p><p>
   (2.) An earnest it is, -- arrhabon. Neither the Greek nor the Latin
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any word to express directly what is here intended. The Latins
   have made words for it, from that expressed here in the Greek, "arrha"
   and "arrabo." The Greek word is but the Hebrew "herabon" [rvvn]; which,
   as some conceive, came amongst them by the Syrian merchants, being a
   word of trade. It is by some rendered, in Latin, "pignus," a "pledge;"
   but this cannot be here intended. A pledge is that property which any
   one gives or leaves in the custody of another, to assure him that he
   will give him, or pay him, some other thing; in the nature of that
   which we call a "pawn." Now, the thing that is here intended, is a part
   of that which is to come, and but a part of it, according to the trade
   use of the word, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> the metaphor is taken; it is excellently
   rendered in our language, an "earnest." An earnest is part of the price
   of any thing, or part of any grant, given beforehand to assure the
   person to whom it is given that at the appointed season he shall
   receive the whole that is promised him.
				</p><p>
   That a thing be an earnest, it is required, --
				</p><p>
   [1.] That it be part of the whole, of the same kind and nature with it;
   as we do give so much money in earnest to pay so much more.
				</p><p>
   [2.] That it be a confirmation of a promise and appointment; first the
   whole is promised, then the earnest is given for the good and true
   performance of that promise.
				</p><p>
   Thus the Spirit is this earnest. God gives us the promise of eternal
   life. To confirm this to us, he gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> us his Spirit; which is, as the
   first part of the promise, to secure us of the whole. Hence he is said
   to be the earnest of the inheritance that is promised and purchased.
				</p><p>
   And it may be considered how it may be said to be an earnest on the
   part of God, who gives him; and on the part of believers, who receive
   him: 
				</p><p>
   1st. He is an earnest on the part of God, in that God gives him as a
   choice part of the inheritance itself, and of the same kind with the
   whole, as an earnest ought to be. The full inheritance promised, is the
   fulness of the Spirit in the enjoyment of God. When that Spirit which
   is given us in this world shall have perfectly taken away all sin and
   sorrow, and shall have made us able to enjoy the glory of God in his
   presence, that is the full inheritance promised. So that the Spirit
   given us for the fitting of us for enjoyment of God in some measure,
   while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> we are here, is the earnest of the whole.
				</p><p>
   God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it to this purpose, to assure us and secure us of the
   inheritance. Having given us so many [358] securities without us, --
   his word, promises, covenant, oath, the revelation and discovery of his
   faithfulness and immutability in them all, -- he is pleased also
   graciously to give us one within us, <reference osisRef="Isa.59.21">Isaiah 59:21</reference>, that we may have all
   the security we are capable of. What can more be done? He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given us
   of the Holy Spirit; -- in him the first-fruits of glory, the utmost
   pledge of his love, the earnest of all.
				</p><p>
   2dly. On the part of believers he is an earnest, in that he gives them
   an acquaintance with, --
				</p><p>
   (1st.) The love of God. Their acceptation with him makes known to them
   their favour in his sight, -- that he is their Father, and will deal
   with them as with children; and consequently, that the inheritance
   shall be theirs. He sends his Spirit into our hearts, "crying, Abba,
   Father," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference> And what is the inference of believers from hence?
   Verse 7, "Then we are not servants, but sons; and if sons, then heirs
   of God." The same apostle, again, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.17">Romans 8:17</reference>, "If children, then
   heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ." On that persuasion
   of the Spirit that we are children, the inference is, "Then heirs,
   heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ." We have, then, a right to
   an inheritance, and an eviction of it. This is the use, then, we have
   of it, -- even the Spirit persuading us of our sonship and acceptation
   with God our Father. And what is this inheritance of glory? "If we
   suffer with him, we shall be glorified together." And that the Spirit
   is given for this end is attested, <reference osisRef="1John.3.24">1 John 3:24</reference>, "Hereby we know that
   he abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note> in us, by the Spirit which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given us." The apostle is
   speaking of our union with God, which he expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> in the words
   foregoing: "He that keeps<note n="keepeth">Auto-modernized</note> his commandments dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in him, and he in
   him;" -- of that union elsewhere. Now, this we know from hence, even by
   the Spirit which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given us, -- the Spirit acquaints us with it.
   Not that we have such an acquaintance, but that the argument is good
   and conclusive in itself, "We have of the Spirit; therefore he dwells
   in us, and we in him:" because, indeed, his dwelling in us is by that
   Spirit, and our interest in him is from thence. A sense of this he
   gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> as he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   (2dly.) The Spirit being given as an earnest, acquaints believers with
   their inheritance, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.9-1Cor.2.10">1 Corinthians 2:9-10</reference> As an earnest, being part of the
   whole, gives knowledge of it, so does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Spirit; as in sundry
   particulars might be demonstrated.
				</p><p>
   So is he in all respects completely an earnest, -- given of God,
   received by us, as the beginning of our inheritance, and the assurance
   of it. So much as we have of the Spirit, so much we have of heaven in
   perfect enjoyment, and so much evidence of its future fulness. Under
   this apprehension of him in the dispensation of grace do believers
   receive him and rejoice in him. Every gracious, self-evidencing act of
   his in their hearts they rejoice in, as a drop from heaven, and long
   for the ocean of it. Not to drive every effect of grace to this issue,
   is to neglect the work of the Holy Ghost in us and towards us.
				</p><p>
   There remains only that a difference be, in a few words, assigned
   between believers receiving the Spirit as an earnest of the whole
   inheritance, and hypocrites "tasting of the powers of the world to
   come," <reference osisRef="Heb.6.5">Hebrews 6:5</reference> A taste of the powers of the world to come seems to
   be the same with the earnest of the inheritance. But, --
				</p><p>
   [1st.] That by "the powers of the world to come" in that place is
   intended the joys of heaven, there is, indeed, no ground to imagine.
   They are nowhere so called; nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it suitably express the glory that
   shall be revealed, which we shall be made partakers of. It is,
   doubtless, the powerful ministry of the ordinances and dispensations of
   the times of the gospel (there called to the Hebrews according to their
   own idiom), the powers or great effectual things of the world to come,
   that is intended. But, --
				</p><p>
   [2dly.] Suppose that by "the powers of the world to come" the glory of
   heaven is intended, there is a wide difference between taking a
   vanishing taste of it ourselves, and receiving an abiding earnest from
   God. To take a taste of the things of heaven, and to have them assured
   of God as from his love, differ greatly. A hypocrite may have his
   thoughts raised to a great deal of joy and contentment in the
   consideration of the good things of the kingdom of God for a season,
   considering the things in themselves; but the Spirit, as he is an
   earnest, gives us a pledge of them as provided for us in the love of
   God and purchase of his Son Jesus Christ. This by the way.
				</p><p>
   7. The Spirit anoints believers. We are "anointed" by the Spirit, <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.21">2 Corinthians 1:21</reference> We have "an unction from the Holy One, and we know all
   things," <reference osisRef="1John.2.20 1John.2.27">1 John 2:20, 27</reference> I cannot intend to run this expression up
   into its rise and original; also, I have done it elsewhere. The use of
   unctions in the Judaical church, the meaning and intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of the
   types attended therewith, the offices that men were consecrated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   thereby, are at the bottom of this expression; nearer the unction of
   Jesus Christ (from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is called Messiah, and the Christ, the
   whole performance of his office of mediatorship being called also his
   anointing, <reference osisRef="Dan.9.24">Daniel 9:24</reference>, as to his furnishing<note n="furnishment">Auto-modernized</note> for it), concurs
   to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Christ is said to be "anointed with the oil of gladness above
   his fellows," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.9">Hebrews 1:9</reference>; which is the same with that of <reference osisRef="John.3.34">John 3:34</reference>,
   "God gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Spirit by measure to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him." We, who have the
   Spirit by measure, are anointed with the "oil of gladness;" Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   the fulness of the Spirit, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> our measure is communicated: so he is
   anointed above us, "that in all things he may have the pre-eminence."
   How Christ was anointed with the Spirit to his threefold office of
   king, priest, and prophet; how, by virtue of an unction, with the same
   Spirit dwelling in him and us, we become to be interested in these
   offices of his, and are made also kings, priests, and prophets to God,
   is known, and would be matter of a long discourse to handle; and my
   design is only to communicate the things treated of:
				</p><p>
   I shall only, therefore, fix on one place, where the communications of
   the Spirit in this unction of Christ are enumerated, -- of which, in
   our measure, from him and with him, by this unction, we are made
   partakers, -- and that is, <reference osisRef="Isa.11.2-Isa.11.3">Isaiah 11:2-3</reference>, "The Spirit of the Lord shall
   rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of
   counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the
   Lord," etc. Many of the endowments of Christ, from the Spirit with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>
   he was abundantly anointed, are here recounted. Principally those of
   wisdom, counsel, and understanding, are insisted on; on the account
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are said to be in
   him, <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference> And though this be but some part of the furniture of
   Jesus Christ for the discharge of his office, yet it is such, as, where
   our anointing to the same purpose is mentioned, it is said peculiarly
   on effecting of such qualifications as these: so <reference osisRef="1John.2.20 1John.2.27">1 John 2:20, 27</reference>, the
   work of the anointing is to teach us; the Spirit in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is a Spirit of
   wisdom and understanding, of counsel, knowledge, and quick
   understanding in the fear of the Lord. So was the great promise of the
   Comforter, that he should "teach us," <reference osisRef="John.14.26">John 14:26</reference>, -- that he should
   "guide us into all truth," chap. xvi. 13. This of teaching us the mind
   and will of God, in the manner in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we are taught it by the Spirit,
   our comforter, is an eminent part of our unction by him; which only I
   shall instance in. Give me leave to say, there is a threefold teaching
   by the Spirit: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) A teaching by the Spirit of conviction and illumination. So the
   Spirit teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> the world (that is, many in it) by the preaching of the
   word; as he is promised to do, <reference osisRef="John.16.8">John 16:8</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) A teaching by the Spirit of sanctification; opening blind eyes,
   giving a new understanding, shining into our hearts, to give us a
   knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; enabling us
   to receive spiritual things in a spiritual light, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.13">1 Corinthians 2:13</reference>; giving
   a saving knowledge of the mystery of the gospel: and this in several
   degrees is common to believers.
				</p><p>
   (3.) A teaching by the Spirit of consolation; -- making sweet, useful,
   and joyful to the soul, the discoveries that are made of the mind and
   will of God in the light of the Spirit of sanctification. Here the oil
   of the Spirit is called the "oil of gladness," -- that which brings joy
   and gladness with it; and the name of Christ thereby discovered is a
   sweet "ointment poured forth," that causes<note n="causeth">Auto-modernized</note> souls to run after him with
   joy and delight, <reference osisRef="Song.1.3">Song of Solomon 1:3</reference> We see it by daily experience, that very
   many have little taste and sweetness and relish in their souls of those
   truths which yet they savingly know and believe; but when we are taught
   by this unction, oh, how sweet is every thing we know of God! As we may
   see in the place of John where mention is made of the teaching of this
   unction, it respects peculiarly the Spirit teaching of us the love of
   God in Christ, the shining of his countenance; which, as David speaks,
   puts gladness into our hearts, <reference osisRef="Ps.4.6-Ps.4.7">Psalms 4:6-7</reference>
				</p><p>
   We have this, then, by the Spirit:  he teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> us of the love of God
   in Christ; he makes every gospel truth as wine well refined to our
   souls, and the good things of it to be a feast of fat things; -- gives
   us joy and gladness of heart with all that we know of God; which is the
   great preservative of the soul to keep it close to truth. The apostle
   speaks of our teaching by this unction, as the means through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are
   preserved from seduction. Indeed, to know any truth in the power,
   sweetness, joy, and gladness of it, is that great security of the
   soul's constancy in the preservation and retaining of it. They will
   readily change truth for error, who find no more sweetness in the one
   than in the other. I must crave the reader's pardon for my brief
   passing over these great things of the gospel; my present design is
   rather to enumerate than to unfold them. This one work of the Holy
   Ghost, might it be pursued, would require a fuller discourse than I can
   allot to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole matter in hand. All the privileges we enjoy, all
   the dignity and honour we are invested withal, our whole dedication
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, our nobility and royalty, our interest in all church
   advantages and approaches to God in worship, our separation from the
   world, the name through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are called, the liberty we enjoy, -- all
   flow from this head, all are branches of this effect of the Holy Ghost.
   I have mentioned only our teaching by this unction, -- a teaching that
   brings joy and gladness with it, by giving the heart a sense of the
   truth in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we are instructed. When we find any of the good truths of
   the gospel come home to our souls with life, vigour, and power, giving
   us gladness of heart, transforming us into the image and likeness of
   it, -- the Holy Ghost is then at his work, is pouring out of his oil.
				</p><p>
   8. We have adoption also by the Spirit; hence he is called the "Spirit
   of adoption;" that is, either he who is given to adopted ones, to
   secure them of it, to beget in their hearts a sense and persuasion of
   the Father's adopting love; or else to give them the privilege itself,
   as is intimated, <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference> Neither is that opposite to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> which we
   have, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference>; for God may send the Spirit of supplication into our
   hearts, because we are sons, and yet adopted by his Spirit. But of this
   elsewhere.
				</p><p>
   9. He is also called the "Spirit of supplication;" under which notion
   he is promised, <reference osisRef="Zech.12.10">Zechariah 12:10</reference>; and how he effects that in us is
   declared, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.26-Rom.8.27">Romans 8:26-27</reference>, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference>; and we are thence said to
   "pray in the Holy Ghost." Our prayers may be considered two ways: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) First, as a spiritual duty required of us by God; and so they are
   wrought in us by the Spirit of sanctification, which helps us to
   perform all our duties, by exalting all the faculties of the soul for
   the spiritual discharge of their respective offices in them.
				</p><p>
   (2.) As a means of retaining communion with God, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we sweetly
   ease our hearts in the bosom of the Father, and receive in refreshing
   tastes of his love. The soul is never more raised with the love of God
   than when by the Spirit taken into intimate communion with him in the
   discharge of this duty; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> it belongs to the Spirit of
   consolation, to the Spirit promised as a comforter. And this is the
   next thing to be considered in our communion with the Holy Ghost, --
   namely, what are the peculiar effects which he works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> in us, and
   towards us, being so bestowed on us as was declared, and working in the
   way and manner insisted on. Now, these are, -- his bringing the
   promises of Christ to remembrance, glorifying him in our hearts,
   shedding abroad the love of God in us, witnessing with us as to our
   spiritual estate and condition, sealing us to the day of redemption
   (being the earnest of our inheritance), anointing us with privileges as
   to their consolation, confirming our adoption, and being present with
   us in our supplications. Here is the wisdom of faith, -- to find out
   and meet with the Comforter in all these things; not to lose their
   sweetness, by lying in the dark [as] to their author, nor coming short
   of the returns which are required of us.

<p>
   The general consequences in the hearts of believers of the effects of
   the Holy Ghost before mentioned -- Consolation; its adjuncts, peace,
   joy -- How it is wrought immediately, mediately.
				</p><p>
   Having proceeded thus far in discovering the way of our communion with
   the Holy Ghost, and insisted on the most noble and known effects that
   he produces<note n="produceth">Auto-modernized</note>, it remains that it be declared what general consequences
   of these effects there are brought forth in the hearts of believers;
   and so we shall at least have made mention of the main heads of his
   dispensation and work in the economy of grace. Now, these (as with the
   former) I shall do little more than name; it being not at all in my
   design to handle the natures of them, but only to show what respects
   they bear to the business in hand: 
				</p><p>
   1. Consolation is the first of these: "The disciples walked in the fear
   of the Lord, and in the consolation of the Holy Ghost," <reference osisRef="Acts.9.31">Acts 9:31</reference>, Te
   paraklesei tou hagiou Pneumatos, He is ho parakletos, and he gives
   paraklesin: from his work towards us, and in us, we have comfort and
   consolation. This is the first general consequent of his dispensation
   and work. Whenever there is mention made of comfort and consolation in
   the Scripture given to the saints (as there is most frequently), it is
   the proper consequent of the work of the Holy Ghost towards them.
   Comfort or consolation in general, is the setting and composing of the
   soul in rest and contentedness in the midst of or from troubles, by the
   consideration or presence of some good, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is interested,
   outweighing the evil, trouble, or perplexity that it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to wrestle
   withal. Where mention is made of comfort and consolation, properly so
   called, there is relation to trouble or perplexity; so the apostle, <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.5-2Cor.1.6">2 Corinthians 1:5-6</reference>, "As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
   consolation also abounds<note n="aboundeth">Auto-modernized</note> by Christ." Suffering and consolation are
   opposed, the latter being a relief against the former; so are all the
   promises of comfort, and all the expressions of it, in the Old and New
   Testament still proposed as reliefs against trouble.
				</p><p>
   And, as I said, consolation arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from the presence or consideration
   of a greater good, that outbalances the evil or perplexity with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> we
   are to contend. Now, in the effects or acts of the Holy Ghost before
   mentioned lie all the springs of our consolation. There is no comfort
   but from them; and there is no trouble that we may not have comfort in
   and against by them. That a man may have consolation in any condition,
   nothing is required but the presence of a good, rendering the evil
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he is pressed inconsiderable to him. Suppose a man under the
   greatest calamity that can possibly befall a child of God, or a
   confluence of all those evils numbered by Paul, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.35">Romans 8:35</reference>, etc.;
   let this man have the Holy Ghost performing the works mentioned before
   towards him, and, in despite of all his evils, his consolations will
   abound. Suppose him to have a sense of the love of God all the while
   shed abroad in his heart, a clear witness within that he is a child of
   God, accepted with him, that he is sealed and marked of God for his
   own, that he is an heir of all the promises of God, and the like; it is
   impossible that man should not triumph in all his tribulations.
				</p><p>
   From this rise of all our consolation are those descriptions which we
   have of it in the Scripture, from its properties and adjuncts; as, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) It is abiding. Thence it is called "Everlasting consolation," <reference osisRef="2Thess.2.16">2 Thessalonians 2:16</reference>, "God, even our Father, which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> loved us, and given us
   everlasting consolation;" -- that is, comfort that vanishes<note n="vanisheth">Auto-modernized</note> not; and
   that because it rises<note n="riseth">Auto-modernized</note> from everlasting things. There may be some
   perishing comfort given for a little season by perishing things; but
   abiding consolation, which we have by the Holy Ghost, is from things
   everlasting:  everlasting love, eternal redemption, an everlasting
   inheritance.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Strong. <reference osisRef="Heb.6.18">Hebrews 6:18</reference>, "That the heirs of the promise should receive
   strong consolation." As strong opposition lies sometimes against us,
   and trouble, whose bands are strong, so is our consolation strong; it
   abounds, and is unconquerable, -- ischura paraklesis. It is such as
   will make its way through all opposition; it confirms, corroborates,
   and strengthens the heart under any evil; it fortifies the soul, and
   makes it able cheerfully to undergo any thing that it is called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>:
   and that because it is from him who is strong.
				</p><p>
   (3.) It is precious. Hence the apostle makes it the great motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   obedience, which he exhorts the Philippians to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, chap. ii. 1, "If
   there be any consolation in Christ;" -- "If you set any esteem and
   valuation upon this precious mercy of consolation in Christ, by those
   comforts, let it be so with you."
				</p><p>
   And this is the first general consequent in the hearts of believers of
   those great effects of the Holy Ghost before mentioned. Now, this is so
   large and comprehensive, comprising so many of our concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> in our
   walking with God, that the Holy Ghost receives his denomination, as to
   the whole work he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to perform for us, from hence, -- he is the
   Comforter; as Jesus Christ, from the work of redemption and salvation,
   is the Redeemer and Saviour of his church. Now, as we have no
   consolation but from the Holy Ghost, so all his effects towards us have
   certainly this consequent more or less in us. Yea, I dare say, whatever
   we have in the kinds of the things before mentioned that brings not
   consolation with it, in the root at least, if not in the ripe fruit, is
   not of the Holy Ghost. The way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> comfort issues out from those
   works of his, belongs to particular cases. The fellowship we have with
   him consists, in no small portion of it, in the consolation we receive
   from him. This gives us a valuation of his love; teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> whither to
   make applications in our distress, -- whom to pray for, to pray to, --
   whom to wait upon, in perplexities.
				</p><p>
   2. Peace arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> hence also. <reference osisRef="Rom.15.13">Romans 15:13</reference>, "The God of hope fill you
   with all peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the
   power of the Holy Ghost." The power of the Holy Ghost is not only
   extended to hope, but to our peace also in believing. So is it in the
   connection of those promises, <reference osisRef="John.14.26-John.14.27">John 14:26-27</reference>, "I will give you the
   Comforter:" and what then? what follows that grant? "Peace," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he,
   "I leave with you; my peace I give to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you." Nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> Christ otherwise
   leave his peace, or give his peace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, but by bestowing the
   Comforter on them. The peace of Christ consists in the soul's sense of
   its acceptation with God in friendship. So is Christ said to be "our
   peace," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.14">Ephesians 2:14</reference>, by slaying the enmity between God and us, and in
   taking away the handwriting that was against us. <reference osisRef="Rom.5.1">Romans 5:1</reference>, "Being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God." A comfortable persuasion
   of our acceptation with God in Christ is the bottom of this peace; it
   inwraps deliverance from eternal wrath, hatred, curse, condemnation, --
   all sweetly affecting the soul and conscience.
				</p><p>
   And this is a branch from the same root with that foregoing, -- a
   consequent of the effects of the Holy Ghost before mentioned. Suppose a
   man chosen in the eternal love of the Father, redeemed by the blood of
   the Son, and justified freely by the grace of God, so that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a
   right to all the promises of the gospel; yet this person can by no
   reasonings nor arguings of his own heart, by no considerations of the
   promises themselves, nor of the love of God or grace of Christ in them,
   be brought to any establishment in peace, until it be produced in him
   as a fruit and consequent of the work of the Holy Ghost in him and
   towards him. "Peace" is the fruit of the Spirit, <reference osisRef="Gal.5.22">Galatians 5:22</reference> The savour
   of the Spirit is "life and peace," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.6">Romans 8:6</reference> All we have is from
   him and by him.
				</p><p>
   3. Joy, also, is of this number. The Spirit, as was showed, is called
   "The oil of gladness," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.9">Hebrews 1:9</reference> His anointing brings gladness with
   it, <reference osisRef="Isa.61.3">Isaiah 61:3</reference>, "The oil of joy for mourning." "The kingdom of God is
   righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost," <reference osisRef="Rom.14.17">Romans 14:17</reference>;
   "Received the word with joy in the Holy Ghost," <reference osisRef="1Thess.1.6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</reference>, -- "with
   joy," as Peter tells believers, "unspeakable and full of glory," 1
   Epist. i. 8. To give joy to the hearts of believers is eminently the
   work of the Comforter; and this he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> by the particulars before
   instanced in. That "rejoicing in hope of the glory of God," mentioned
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.2">Romans 5:2</reference>, which carries the soul through any tribulation, even with
   glorying, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> its rise in the Spirit's "shedding abroad the love of
   God in our hearts," verse 5. Now, there are two ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the Spirit
   works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> this joy in the hearts of believers: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it immediately by himself; without the consideration of
   any other acts or works of his, or the interposition of any reasonings,
   or deductions and conclusions. As in sanctification he is a well of
   water springing up in the soul, immediately exerting his efficacy and
   refreshment; so in consolation, he immediately works the soul and minds
   of men to a joyful, rejoicing, and spiritual frame, filling them with
   exultation and gladness; -- not that this arises from our reflex
   consideration of the love of God, but rather gives occasion to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
   When he so sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, and so fills
   them with gladness by an immediate act and operation (as he caused John
   Baptist to leap for joy in the womb upon the approach of the mother of
   Jesus), -- then does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the soul, even from hence, raise itself to a
   consideration of the love of God, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> joy and rejoicing does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> also
   flow. Of this joy there is no account to be given, but that the Spirit
   works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> it when and how he will. He secretly infuses<note n="infuseth">Auto-modernized</note> and distils it
   into the soul, prevailing against all fears and sorrows, filling it
   with gladness, exultations; and sometimes with unspeakable raptures of
   mind.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Mediately. By his other works towards us, he gives a sense of the
   love of God, with our adoption and acceptation with him; and on the
   consideration of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> enables us to receive it. Let what has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   spoken of his operations towards us be considered, -- what assurance he
   gives us of the love of God; what life, power, and security; what
   pledge of our eternal welfare, -- and it will be easily perceived that
   he lays a sufficient foundation of this joy and gladness. Not that we
   are able, upon any rational consideration, deduction, or conclusion,
   that we can make from the things mentioned, to affect our hearts with
   the joy and gladness intended; it is left no less the proper work of
   the Spirit to do it from hence, and by the intervenience of these
   considerations, than to do it immediately without them. This process of
   producing joy in the heart, we have, <reference osisRef="Ps.23.5-Ps.23.6">Psalms 23:5-6</reference>, "You<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> anointest
   my head with oil." Hence is the conclusion, as in the way of
   exultation, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me." Of this effect
   of the Comforter, see Isa. xxxv. throughout.
				</p><p>
   4. Hope, also, is an effect of those workings of the Holy Ghost in us
   and towards us, <reference osisRef="Rom.15.13">Romans 15:13</reference> These, I say, are the general consequents
   of the effects of the Holy Ghost upon the hearts of believers; which,
   if we might consider them in their offspring, with all the branches
   that shoot out from them, in exultation, assurance, boldness,
   confidence, expectation, glorying, and the like, it would appear how
   far our whole communion with God is influenced by them. But I only name
   the heads of things, and hasten to what remains. It is the general and
   particular way of our communion with the Holy Ghost that should nextly
   ensue, but that some other considerations necessarily do here interpose
   themselves.
</p>

<title>Part 3 Chapter 5</title>
<p>
   Some observations and inferences from discourses foregoing concerning
   the Spirit -- The contempt of the whole administration of the Spirit by
   some -- The vain pretence of the Spirit by others -- The false spirit
   discovered.
				</p><p>
   This process being made, I should now show immediately, how we hold the
   communion proposed with the Holy Ghost, in the things laid down and
   manifested to contain his peculiar work towards us; but there are some
   miscarriages in the world in reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this dispensation of the
   Holy Ghost, both on the one hand and the other, in contempt of his true
   work and pretence of that which is not, that I cannot but remark in my
   passage: which to do shall be the business of this chapter.
				</p><p>
   Take a view, then, of the state and condition of them who, professing
   to believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, do yet contemn and despise his
   Spirit, as to all its operations, gifts, graces, and dispensations to
   his churches and saints. While<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> Christ was in the world with his
   disciples, he made them no greater promise, neither in respect of their
   own good nor of carrying on the work which he had committed to them,
   than this of giving them the Holy Ghost. Him he instructs<note n="instructeth">Auto-modernized</note> them to
   pray for of the Father, as that which is needful for them, as bread for
   children, <reference osisRef="Luke.11.13">Luke 11:13</reference> Him he promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> them, as a well of water
   springing up in them, for their refreshment, strengthening, and
   consolation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> everlasting life, <reference osisRef="John.7.37-John.7.39">John 7:37-39</reference>; as also to carry on
   and accomplish the whole work of the ministry to them committed, <reference osisRef="John.16.8-John.16.11">John 16:8-11</reference>; with all those eminent works and privileges before
   mentioned. And upon his ascension, this is laid as the bottom of that
   glorious communication of gifts and graces in his plentiful effusion
   mentioned, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.8 Eph.4.11-Eph.4.12">Ephesians 4:8, 11-12</reference>, -- namely, that he had received of the
   Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, <reference osisRef="Acts.2.33">Acts 2:33</reference>; and that in such an
   eminent manner as thereby to make the greatest and most glorious
   difference between the administration of the new covenant and old.
   Especially does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the whole work of the ministry relate to the Holy
   Ghost; though that be not my present business to evince. He calls men
   to that work, and they are separated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, <reference osisRef="Acts.13.2">Acts 13:2</reference>; he
   furnishes<note n="furnisheth">Auto-modernized</note> them with gifts and abilities for that employment, <reference osisRef="1Cor.12.7-1Cor.12.10">1 Corinthians 12:7-10</reference> So that the whole religion we profess, without this
   administration of the Spirit, is nothing; nor is there any fruit
   without it of the resurrection of Christ from the dead.
				</p><p>
   This being the state of things, -- that in our worship of and obedience
   to God, in our own consolation, sanctification, and ministerial
   employment, the Spirit is the principle, the life, soul, the all of the
   whole; yet so desperate has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been the malice of Satan, and wickedness
   of men, that their great endeavour has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been to shut him quite out of
   all gospel administrations.
				</p><p>
   First, his gifts and graces were not only decried, but almost excluded
   from the public worship of the church, by the imposition of an operose
   form of service, to be read by the minister; which to do is neither a
   peculiar gift of the Holy Ghost to any, nor of the ministry at all. It
   is marvellous to consider what pleas and pretences were invented and
   used by learned men, -- from its antiquity, its composure and
   approbation by martyrs, the beauty of uniformity in the worship of God,
   established and pressed thereby, etc., -- for the defence and
   maintenance of it. But the main argument they insisted on, and the
   chief field in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they expatiated and laid out all their eloquence,
   was the vain babbling repetitions and folly of men praying by the
   Spirit. When once this was fallen upon, all (at least as they supposed)
   was carried away before them, and their adversaries rendered
   sufficiently ridiculous: so great is the cunning of Satan, and so
   unsearchable are the follies of the hearts of men. The sum of all these
   reasonings amounts to no more but this, -- "Though the Lord Jesus
   Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised the Holy Ghost to be with his church to the end of
   the world, to fit and furnish men with gifts and abilities for the
   carrying on of that worship which he requires and accepts<note n="accepteth">Auto-modernized</note> at our
   hands, yet the work is not done to the purpose; the gifts he bestows
   are not sufficient to that end, neither as to invocation nor doctrine:
   and, therefore, we will not only help men by our directions, but
   exclude them from their exercise." This; I say, was the sum of all, as
   I could undeniably evidence, were that my present business, what
   innumerable evils ensue on this principle, in a formal setting apart of
   men to the ministry who had never once "tasted of the powers of the
   world to come," nor received any gifts from the Holy Ghost to that
   purpose; of crying up and growing in an outside pompous worship, wholly
   foreign to the power and simplicity of the gospel; of silencing,
   destroying, banishing, men whose ministry was accompanied with the
   evidence and demonstration of the Spirit, -- I shall not need to
   declare. This is that I aim at, to point out the public contempt of the
   Holy Ghost, his gifts and graces, with their administration in the
   church of God, that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been found even where the gospel has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   professed.
				</p><p>
   Again: it is a thing of most sad consideration, once to call to mind
   the improvement of that principle of contempt of the Spirit in private
   men and their ways. The name of the Spirit was grown a term of
   reproach. To plead for, or pretend to pray by, the Spirit, was enough
   to render a man the object of scorn and reproach from all sorts of men,
   from the pulpit to the stage. "What! you are full of the Spirit; you
   will pray by the Spirit; you have the gift: let us hear your nonsense;"
   -- and yet, perhaps, these men would think themselves wronged not to be
   accounted Christians. Christians! yea, have not some pretending
   themselves to be leaders of the flock, -- yea, mounted a storey or two
   above their brethren, and claiming a rule and government over them, --
   made it their business to scoff at and reproach the gifts of the Spirit
   of God? And if this were the frame of their spirit, what might be
   expected from others of professed profaneness? It is not imaginable to
   what height of blasphemy the process in this kind amounted. The Lord
   grant there be nothing of this cursed leaven still remaining amongst
   us! Some bleatings of ill importance [359] are sometimes heard. Is this
   the fellowship of the Holy Ghost that believers are called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>? Is
   this the due entertainment of him whom our Saviour promised to send for
   the supply of his bodily absence, so as we might be no losers thereby?
   Is it not enough that men should be contented with such a stupid
   blindness, as, being called Christians, to look no farther for their
   comfort and consolation than moral considerations common to heathens
   would lead them, when one infinitely holy and blessed person of the
   Trinity has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taken this office upon him to be our comforter, but they
   must oppose and despise him also? Nothing more discovers how few there
   are in the world that have interest in that blessed name through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are
   all called. But this is no place to pursue this discourse. The aim of
   this discourse is, to evince the folly and madness of men in general,
   who profess to own the gospel of Christ, and yet contemn and despise
   his Spirit, in whomsoever he is manifested. Let us be zealous of the
   gifts of the Spirit, not envious at them.
				</p><p>
   From what has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been discoursed we may also try the spirits that are
   gone abroad in the world, and which have been exercising themselves, at
   several seasons, ever since the ascension of Christ. The iniquity of
   the generation that is past and passing away lay in open, cursed
   opposition to the Holy Ghost. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been above them, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they
   behaved themselves presumptuously. Satan, whose design, as he is god of
   this world, is to be uppermost, not to dwell wholly in any form cast
   down by the providence of God, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> now transformed himself into an
   angel of light; and he will pretend the Spirit also and only. But there
   are "seducing spirits," <reference osisRef="1Tim.4.1">1 Timothy 4:1</reference>; and we have a "command not to
   believe every spirit, but try the spirits," <reference osisRef="1John.4.1">1 John 4:1</reference>; and the
   reason added is, "Because many false prophets are gone out into the
   world;" -- that is, men pretending to the revelation of new doctrines
   by the Spirit; whose deceits in the first church Paul intimates<note n="intimateth">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="2Thess.2.2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</reference>; calling on men not to be "shaken in mind by spirit." The
   truth is, the spirits of these days are so gross, that a man of a very
   easy discerning may find them out and yet their delusion so strong,
   that not a few are deceived. This is one thing that lies evident to
   every eye, -- that, according to his wonted course, Satan, with his
   delusions, is run into an extreme to his former actings.
				</p><p>
   Not long since, his great design, as I manifested, was to cry up
   ordinances without the Spirit, casting all the reproach that he could
   upon him; -- now, to cry up a spirit without and against ordinances,
   casting all reproach and contempt possible upon them. Then, he would
   have a ministry without the Spirit; -- now, a Spirit without a
   ministry. Then, the reading of the word might suffice, without either
   preaching or praying by the Spirit, -- now, the Spirit is enough,
   without reading or studying the word at all. Then, he allowed a literal
   embracing of what Christ had done in the flesh; -- now, he talks of
   Christ in the Spirit only, and denies him to be come in the flesh, --
   the proper character of the false spirit we are warned of, <reference osisRef="1John.4.1">1 John 4:1</reference> Now, because it is most certain that the Spirit which we are to hear
   and embrace is the Spirit promised by Christ (which is so clear, that
   him the Montanists' paraclete, yea, and Mohammed, pretended himself to
   be, and those of our days affirm, who pretend the same), let us briefly
   try them by some of the effects mentioned, which Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised
   to give the Holy Ghost for: 
				</p><p>
   The first general effect, as was observed, was this, -- that he should
   bring to remembrance the things that Christ spake, for our guidance and
   consolation. This was to he the work of the Holy Ghost towards the
   apostles, who were to be the penmen of the Scriptures: this is to be
   his work towards believers to the end of the world. Now, the things
   that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> spoken and done are "written that we might believe,
   and believing, have life through his name," <reference osisRef="John.20.31">John 20:31</reference>; they are
   written in the Scripture. This, then, is the work of the Spirit which
   Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised; -- he shall bring to our remembrance, and give us
   understanding of the words of Christ in the Scripture, for our guidance
   and consolation. Is this, now, the work of the spirit which is abroad
   in the world, and perverts<note n="perverteth">Auto-modernized</note> many? Nothing less. His business is, to
   decry the things that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> spoken which are written in the word;
   to pretend new revelations of his own; to lead men from the written
   word, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the whole work of God and all the promises of Christ are
   recorded.
				</p><p>
   Again: the work of the Spirit promised by Christ is to glorify him: "He
   shall glorify me; for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   you," <reference osisRef="John.16.14">John 16:14</reference> Him who was to suffer at Jerusalem, who then spake
   to his disciples, it was to make him glorious, honourable, and of high
   esteem in the hearts of believers; and that by showing his things (his
   love, kindness, grace, and purchase) to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. This is the work of the
   Spirit. The work of the spirit that is gone abroad, is to glorify
   itself, to decry and render contemptible Christ that suffered for us,
   under the name of a Christ without us; which it slights and despises<note n="despiseth">Auto-modernized</note>,
   and that professedly. Its own glory, its own honour, is all that it
   aims at; wholly inverting the order of the divine dispensations. The
   fountain of all being and lying in the Father's love, the Son came to
   glorify the Father. He still says, "I seek not mine own glory, but the
   glory of him that sent me." The Son having carried on the work of
   redemption, was now to be glorified with the Father. So he prays that
   it might be, <reference osisRef="John.17.1">John 17:1</reference>, "The hour is come, glorify your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Son;" and
   that with the glory which he had before the world was, when his joint
   counsel was in the carrying on the Father's love. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy
   Ghost is sent, and his work is to glorify the Son. But now, as I said,
   we have a spirit come forth whose whole business is to glorify himself;
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we may easily know from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is.
				</p><p>
   Furthermore: the Holy Ghost sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts,
   as was declared, and thence fills them with joy, peace, and hope;
   quieting and refreshing the hearts of them in whom he dwells; giving
   them liberty and rest, confidence, and the boldness of children. This
   spirit of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> men now boast is a spirit of bondage, whose utmost work
   is to make men quake and tremble; casting them into an un-son-like
   frame of spirit, driving them up and down with horror and bondage, and
   drinking up their very natural spirits, and making their whole man
   wither away. There is scarce any one thing that more evidently
   manifests<note n="manifesteth">Auto-modernized</note> the spirit through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> some are now acted not to be the
   Comforter promised by Christ, than this, -- that he is a spirit of
   bondage and slavery in them in whom he is, and a spirit of cruelty and
   reproach towards others; in a direct opposition to the Holy Ghost in
   believers, and all the ends and purposes for which, as a spirit of
   adoption and consolation, he is bestowed on them.
				</p><p>
   To give one instance more: the Holy Ghost bestowed on believers is a
   Spirit of prayer and supplication; as was manifested. The spirit
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> we have to do, pretends the carrying men above such low and
   contemptible means of communion with God. In a word, it were a very
   easy and facile task, to pass through all of the eminent effects of the
   Holy Ghost in and towards believers, and to manifest that the
   pretending spirit of our days comes in a direct opposition and
   contradiction to every one of them. Thus has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> Satan passed from one
   extreme to another, -- from a bitter, wretched opposition to the Spirit
   of Christ, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a cursed pretending to the Spirit; still to the same
   end and purpose.
				</p><p>
   I might give sundry other instances of the contempt or abuse of the
   dispensation of the Spirit. Those mentioned are the extremes to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>
   all other are or may be reduced; and I will not farther divert from
   that which lies directly in my aim.

   comforts us in and against; with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>; how.
				</p><p>
   The way being thus made plain for us, I come to show how we hold
   particular communion with the Holy Ghost, as he is promised of Christ
   to be our comforter, and as working out our consolation by the means
   formerly insisted on. Now, the first thing I shall do in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, is the
   proposal of that which may be some preparation to the duty under
   consideration; and this by leading the souls of believers to a due
   valuation of this work of his towards us, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is called our
   Comforter.
				</p><p>
   To raise up our hearts to this frame, and fit us for the duty intended,
   let us consider these three things: 
				</p><p>
   First, What it is he comforts us against.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, With which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he comforts us.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly, The principle of all his actings and operations in us for our
   consolation.
				</p><p>
   First. There are but three things in the whole course of our pilgrimage
   that the consolations of the Holy Ghost are useful and necessary in: 
				</p><p>
   1. In our afflictions. Affliction is part of the provision that God
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made in his house for his children, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.5-Heb.12.6">Hebrews 12:5-6</reference> The great
   variety of its causes, means, uses, and effects, is generally known.
   There is a measure of them appointed for every one. To be wholly
   without them is a temptation; and so in some measure an affliction.
   That which I am to speak to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> is, that in all our afflictions we need
   the consolations of the Holy Ghost. It is the nature of man to relieve
   himself, when he is entangled, by all ways and means. According as
   men's natural spirits are, so do they manage themselves under
   pressures. "The spirit of a man will bear his infirmity;" at least,
   will struggle with it.
				</p><p>
   There are two great evils, one of which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> generally seize on men
   under their afflictions, and keep them from a due management of them.
   The apostle mentions<note n="mentioneth">Auto-modernized</note> them both, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.5">Hebrews 12:5</reference>, Me oligorei paideias
   Kuriou, mede ekluou, hup' autou elenchomenos, -- "Despise not the
   chastisement of the Lord; neither faint when you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> are<note n="art">Auto-modernized</note> reproved." One of
   these extremes do men usually fall into; either they despise the Lord's
   correction, or sink under it.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Men despise it. They account that which befalls them to be a light
   or common thing; they take no notice of God in it; they can shift with
   it well enough: they look on instruments, second causes; provide for
   their own defence and vindication with little regard to God or his hand
   in their affliction. And the ground of this is, because they take in
   succours, in their trouble, that God will not mix his grace withal;
   they fix on other remedies than what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed, and utterly
   lose all the benefits and advantage of their affliction. And so shall
   every man do that relieves himself from any thing but the consolations
   of the Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Men faint and sink under their trials and afflictions; which the
   apostle farther reproves, verse 12. The first despise the assistance of
   the Holy Ghost through pride of heart; the latter refuse it through
   dejectedness of spirit, and sink under the weight of their troubles.
   And who, almost, is there that offends not on one of these hands? Had
   we not learned to count light of the chastisements of the Lord, and to
   take little notice of his dealings with us, we should find the season
   of our afflictions to comprise no small portion of our pilgrimage.
				</p><p>
   Now, there is no due management of our souls under any affliction, so
   that God may have the glory of it, and ourselves any spiritual benefit
   or improvement thereby, but by the consolations of the Holy Ghost. All
   that our Saviour promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples, when he tells them of the
   great trials and tribulations they were to undergo, is, "I will send
   you the Spirit, the Comforter; he shall give you peace in me, when in
   the world you shall have trouble. He shall guide and direct, and keep
   you in all your trials." And so, the apostle tells us, it came to pass,
   <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.4-2Cor.1.6">2 Corinthians 1:4-6</reference>; yea, and this, under the greatest afflictions, will
   carry the soul to the highest joy, peace, rest, and contentment. So the
   same apostle, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.3">Romans 5:3</reference>, "We glory in tribulations." It is a great
   expression. He had said before, "We rejoice in hope of the glory of
   God," verse 2. Yea, but what if manifold afflictions and tribulations
   befall us? "Why, even in them also we glory," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he; "we glory in
   our tribulations." But from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is it that our spirits are so borne up to
   a due management of afflictions, as to glory in them in the Lord? He
   tells us, verse 5, it is from the "shedding abroad of the love of God
   in our hearts by the Holy Ghost." And thence are believers said to
   "receive the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost," <reference osisRef="1Thess.1.6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</reference>; and to "take joyfully the spoiling of their goods." This
   is that I aim at:  there is no management nor improvement of any
   affliction, but merely and solely by the consolations of the Holy
   Ghost. Is it, then, of any esteem or value to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you that you lose not
   all your trials, temptations, and affliction? -- learn to value that
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> alone they are rendered useful.
				</p><p>
   2. Sin is the second burden of our lives, and much the greatest. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   this is this consolation peculiarly suited. So <reference osisRef="Heb.6.17-Heb.6.18">Hebrews 6:17-18</reference>, an
   allusion is taken from the manslayer under the law, who, having killed
   a man unawares, and brought the guilt of his blood upon himself, fled
   with speed for his deliverance to the city of refuge. Our great and
   only refuge from the guilt of sin is the Lord Jesus Christ; in our
   flying to him, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Spirit administer consolation to us. A sense of
   sin fills the heart with troubles and disquietness; it is the Holy
   Ghost which gives us peace in Christ; -- that gives an apprehension of
   wrath; the Holy Ghost sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts; --
   from thence does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> Satan and the law accuse us, as objects of God's
   hatred; the Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are the
   children of God. There is not any one engine or instrument that sin
   uses<note n="useth">Auto-modernized</note> or sets up against our peace, but one effect or other of the Holy
   Ghost towards us is suited and fitted to the casting of it down.
				</p><p>
   3. In the whole course of our obedience are his consolations necessary
   also, that we may go through with it cheerfully, willingly, patiently
   to the end. This will afterward be more fully discovered, as to
   particulars, when I come to give directions for our communion with this
   blessed Comforter. In a word, in all the concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of this life, and
   in our whole expectation of another, we stand in need of the
   consolations of the Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   Without them, we shall either despise afflictions or faint under them,
   and God be neglected as to his intendments in them.
				</p><p>
   Without them, sin will either harden us to a contempt of it, or cast us
   down to a neglect of the remedies graciously provided against it.
				</p><p>
   Without them, duties will either puff us up with pride, or leave us
   without that sweetness which is in new obedience.
				</p><p>
   Without them, prosperity will make us carnal, sensual, and to take up
   our contentment in these things, and utterly weaken us for the trials
   of adversity.
				</p><p>
   Without them, the comforts of our relations will separate us from God,
   and the loss of them make our hearts as Nabal's.
				</p><p>
   Without them, the calamity of the church will overwhelm us, and the
   prosperity of the church will not concern us.
				</p><p>
   Without them, we shall have wisdom for no work, peace in no condition,
   strength for no duty, success in no trial, joy in no state, -- no
   comfort in life, no light in death.
				</p><p>
   Now, our afflictions, our sins, and our obedience, with the
   attendancies of them respectively, are the great concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of our
   lives. What we are in reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God is comprised in them, and the
   due management of them, with their contraries, which come under the
   same rule; through all these does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> there run a line of consolation from
   the Holy Ghost, that gives us a joyful issue throughout. How sad is the
   condition of poor souls destitute of these consolations. What poor
   shifts are they forced to betake themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>! what giants have they
   to encounter in their own strength! and whether they are conquered or
   seem to conquer, they have nothing but the misery of their trials!
				</p><p>
   The second thing considerable, to teach us to put a due valuation on
   the consolations of the Holy Ghost, is the matter of them, or that
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he comforts us. Now, this may be referred to the two heads
   that I have formerly treated of, -- the love of the Father, and the
   grace of the Son. All the consolations of the Holy Ghost consist in his
   acquainting us with, and communicating to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, the love of the Father
   and the grace of the Son; nor is there any thing in the one or the
   other but he makes it a matter of consolation to us: so that, indeed,
   we have our communion with the Father in his love, and the Son in his
   grace, by the operation of the Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   1. He communicates to us, and acquaints us with, the love of the
   Father. Having informed his disciples with that ground and foundation
   of their consolation which by the Comforter they should receive, our
   blessed Saviour (<reference osisRef="John.16.27">John 16:27</reference>) shuts up all in this, "The Father
   himself loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> you." This is that which the Comforter is given to
   acquaint us withal, -- even that God is the Father, and that he loves
   us. In particular, that the Father, the first person in the Trinity,
   considered so distinctly, loves us. On this account is he said so often
   to come forth from the Father, because he comes in pursuit of his love,
   and to acquaint the hearts of believers therewith, that they may be
   comforted and established. By persuading us of the eternal and
   unchangeable love of the Father, he fills us with consolation. And,
   indeed, all the effects of the Holy Ghost before mentioned have their
   tendency this way. Of this love and its transcendent excellency you
   heard at large before. Whatever is desirable in it is thus communicated
   to us by the Holy Ghost. A sense of this is able not only to relieve
   us, but to make us in every condition to rejoice with joy unspeakable
   and glorious. It is not with an increase of corn, and wine, and oil,
   but with the shining of the countenance of God upon us, that he
   comforts our souls, <reference osisRef="Ps.4.6-Ps.4.7">Psalms 4:6-7</reference> "The world hates<note n="hateth">Auto-modernized</note> me," may such a
   soul as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the Spirit say; "but my Father loves me. Men despise me as
   a hypocrite; but my Father loves me as a child. I am poor in this
   world; but I have a rich inheritance in the love of my Father. I am
   straitened in all things; but there is bread enough in my Father's
   house. I mourn in secret under the power of my lusts and sin, where no
   eyes see me; but the Father sees me, and is full of compassion. With a
   sense of his kindness, which is better than life, I rejoice in
   tribulation, glory in affliction, triumph as a conqueror. Though I am
   killed all the day long, all my sorrows have a bottom that may be
   fathomed, -- my trials, bounds that may be compassed; but the breadth,
   and depth, and height of the love of the Father, who can express?" I
   might render glorious this way of the Spirit's comforting us with the
   love of the Father, by comparing it with all other causes and means of
   joy and consolation whatever; and so discover their emptiness, its
   fulness, -- their nothingness, its being all; as also by revealing the
   properties of it before rehearsed.
				</p><p>
   2. Again: he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it by communicating to us, and acquainting us with,
   the grace of Christ, -- all the fruits of his purchase, all the
   desirableness of his person, as we are interested in him. The grace of
   Christ, as I formerly discoursed of at large, is referred to two heads,
   -- the grace of his person, and of his office and work. By both them
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Ghost administer consolation to us, <reference osisRef="John.16.14">John 16:14</reference> He
   glorifies Christ by revealing his excellencies and desirableness to
   believers, as the "chiefest of ten thousand, -- altogether lovely," and
   then he shows them of the things of Christ, -- his love, grace, all the
   fruits of his death, suffering, resurrection, and intercession: and
   with these supports their hearts and souls. And here, whatever is of
   refreshment in the pardon of sin, deliverance from the curse, and wrath
   to come, in justification and adoption, with the innumerable privileges
   attending them in the hope of glory given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, comes in on this
   head of account.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly. The principle and fountain of all his actings for our
   consolation comes next under consideration, to the same end; and this
   leads us a little nearer to the communion intended to be directed in.
   Now, this is his own great love and infinite condescension. He
   willingly proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> or comes forth from the Father to be our
   comforter. He knew what we were, and what we could do, and what would
   be our dealings with him, -- he knew we would grieve him, provoke him,
   quench his motions, defile his dwelling-place; and yet he would come to
   be our comforter. Want of a due consideration of this great love of the
   Holy Ghost weakens all the principles of our obedience. Did this dwell
   and abide upon our hearts, what a dear valuation must we needs put upon
   all his operations and actings towards us! Nothing, indeed, is valuable
   but what comes from love and good-will. This is the way the Scripture
   takes to raise up our hearts to a right and due estimation of our
   redemption by Jesus Christ. It tells us that he did it freely; that of
   his own will he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> laid down his life; that he did it out of love.
   [360] "In this was manifested the love of God, that he laid down his
   life for us;" "He loved us, and gave himself for us;" "He loved us, and
   washed us from our sins in his own blood." To this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> it adds our state
   and condition, considered as he undertook for us, -- sinners, enemies,
   dead, alienated; then he loved us, and died for us, and washed us with
   his blood. May we not hence, also, have a valuation of the dispensation
   of the Spirit for our consolation? He proceeds to that end from the
   Father; he distributes as he will, works as he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>. And what are
   we, towards whom he carries<note n="carrieth">Auto-modernized</note> on this work? Froward, perverse,
   unthankful; grieving, vexing, provoking him. Yet in his love and
   tenderness does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he continue to do us good. Let us by faith consider
   this love of the Holy Ghost. It is the head and source of all the
   communion we have with him in this life. This is, as I said, spoken
   only to prepare our hearts to the communion proposed; and what a little
   portion is it of what might be spoken! How might all these
   considerations be aggravated! what a numberless number might be added!
   It suffices that, from what is spoken, it appears that the work in hand
   is amongst the greatest duties and most excellent privileges of the
   gospel.

</p>

<title>Part 3 Chapter 7</title>
<p>
   The general ways of the saints' acting in communion with the Holy
   Ghost.
				</p><p>
   As in the account given of the actings of the Holy Ghost in us, we
   manifested first the general adjuncts of his actings, or the manner
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; so now, in the description of the returns of our souls to him,
   I shall, in the first place, propose the general actings of faith in
   reference to this work of the Holy Ghost, and then descend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   particulars. Now, there are three general ways of the soul's deportment
   in this communion, expressed all negatively in the Scripture, but all
   including positive duties. Now these are, -- First, Not to grieve him.
   Secondly, Not to quench his motions. Thirdly, Not to resist him.
				</p><p>
   There are three things considerable in the Holy Ghost:  1. His person,
   as dwelling in us; 2. His actings by grace, or his motions; 3. His
   working in the ordinances of the word, and the sacraments; -- all for
   the same end and purpose.
				</p><p>
   To these three are the three cautions before suited:  1. Not to grieve
   him, in respect of his person dwelling in us. 2. Not to quench him, in
   respect of the actings and motions of his grace. 3. Not to resist him,
   in respect of the ordinances of Christ, and his gifts for their
   administration. Now, because the whole general duty of believers, in
   their communion with the Holy Ghost, is comprised in these three
   things, I shall handle them severally: 
				</p><p>
   1. The first caution concerns his person immediately, as dwelling in
   us. It is given, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.30">Ephesians 4:30</reference>, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God."
   There is a complaint, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.10">Isaiah 63:10</reference>, of them who vexed or grieved the
   Spirit of God; and from thence does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this caution seem to be taken. That
   it is the person of the Holy Ghost which is here intended, is evident,
   --
				</p><p>
   (1.) From the phrase, or manner of expression, with a double article,
   To Pneuma to hagion, -- "That Holy Spirit;" and also, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) From the work assigned to him in the following words, of "sealing
   to the day of redemption;" which, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been manifested, is the work
   of the Holy Ghost. Now, whereas this may be understood of the Spirit in
   others, or in ourselves, it is evident that the apostle intends it in
   the latter sense, by his addition of that signal and eminent privilege
   which we ourselves enjoy by him: he seals us to the day of redemption.
				</p><p>
   Let us see, then, the tendency of this expression, as comprising the
   first general rule of our communion with the Holy Ghost, -- "Grieve not
   the Spirit."
				</p><p>
   The term of "grieving," or affecting with sorrow, may be considered
   either actively, in respect of the persons grieving; or passively, in
   respect of the persons grieved. In the latter sense the expression is
   metaphorical. The Spirit cannot be grieved, or affected with sorrow;
   which infers alteration, disappointment, weakness, -- all incompatible
   with his infinite perfections; yet men may actively do that which is
   fit and able to grieve any one that stands affected towards them as
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Ghost. If he be not grieved, it is no thanks to us, but
   to his own unchangeable nature. So that there are two things denoted in
   this expression: 
				</p><p>
   First, That the Holy Ghost is affected towards us as one that is
   loving, careful, tender, concerned in our good and well-doing; and
   therefore upon our miscarriages is said to be grieved: as a good friend
   of a kind and loving nature is apt to be on the miscarriage of him whom
   he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> affect. And this is that we are principally to regard in this
   caution, as the ground and foundation of it, -- the love, kindness, and
   tenderness of the Holy Ghost to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. "Grieve him not."
				</p><p>
   Secondly, That we may do those things that are proper to grieve him,
   though he be not passively grieved; our sin being no less in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> than
   if he were grieved as we are. Now, how this is done, how the Spirit is
   grieved, the apostle declares<note n="declareth">Auto-modernized</note> in the contexture of that discourse,
   verses 21-24. He presses<note n="presseth">Auto-modernized</note> to a progress in sanctification, and all the
   fruits of regeneration, verses 25-29. He dehorts from sundry particular
   evils that were contrary thereto, and then gives the general
   enforcement of the one and the other, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit
   of God;" that is, by coming short of that universal sanctification
   which our planting into Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> require. The positive duty included
   in this caution, of not grieving the Holy Spirit, is this, -- that we
   pursue universal holiness with regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and upon the account of,
   the love, kindness, and tenderness, of the Holy Ghost. This is the
   foundation of our communion we have in general. When the soul considers
   the love, kindness, and tenderness of the Holy Ghost to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; when he
   considers all the fruits and acts of his love and good-will towards
   him; and on that account, and under that consideration, because he is
   so concerned in our ways and walkings, to abstain from evils, and to
   walk in all duties of holiness, -- this is to have communion with him.
   This consideration, that the Holy Ghost, who is our comforter, is
   delighted with our obedience, grieved at our evils and follies, being
   made a continual motive to, and reason of, our close walking with God
   in all holiness, is, I say, the first general way of our communion with
   him.
				</p><p>
   Here let us fix a little. We lose both the power and pleasure of our
   obedience for want of this consideration. We see on what account the
   Holy Ghost undertakes to be our comforter, by what ways and means he
   performs that office towards us; what an unworthy thing it is to grieve
   him, who comes to us on purpose to give us consolation! Let the soul,
   in the whole course of its obedience, exercise itself by faith to
   thoughts of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, and lay due weight upon it: "The Holy Ghost, in his
   infinite love and kindness towards me, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> condescended to be my
   comforter; he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it willingly, freely, powerfully. What have I
   received from him! in the multitude of my perplexities how has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he
   refreshed my soul! Can I live one day without his consolations? And
   shall I be regardless of him in that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is concerned? Shall I
   grieve him by negligence, sin, and folly? Shall not his love constrain
   me to walk before him to all well-pleasing?" So have we in general
   fellowship with him.
				</p><p>
   2. The second is that of <reference osisRef="1Thess.5.19">1 Thessalonians 5:19</reference>, "Quench not the Spirit." There
   are various thoughts about the sense of these words. "The Spirit in
   others, that is, their spiritual gifts," say some; but then it falls in
   with what follows, verse 20, "Despise not prophesying." "The light that
   God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> set up in our hearts," say others; but where is that called
   absolutely To Pneuma, -- "The Spirit?" It is the Holy Ghost himself
   that is here intended, not immediately, in respect of his person (in
   which regard he is said to be grieved, which is a personal affection);
   but in respect of his motions, actings, and operations. The Holy Ghost
   was typified by the fire that was always kept alive on the altar. He is
   also called a "Spirit of burning." The reasons of that allusion are
   manifold; not now to be insisted on. Now, the opposition that is made
   to fire in its actings, is by quenching. Hence the opposition made to
   the actings of the Holy Ghost are called "quenching of the Spirit," as
   some kind of wet wood will do, when it is cast into the fire. Thence
   are we said, in pursuance of the same metaphor, anazopurein, -- to
   "stir up with new fire," the gifts that are in us. The Holy Ghost is
   striving with us, acting in us, moving variously for our growth in
   grace, and bringing forth fruit meet for the principle he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> endued
   us withal. "Take heed," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle, "lest, by the power of your
   lusts and temptations, you attend not to his workings, but hinder him
   in his good-will towards you; that is, what in you lies<note n="lieth">Auto-modernized</note>."
				</p><p>
   This, then, is the second general rule for our communion with the Holy
   Ghost. It respects his gracious operations in us and by us. There are
   several and various ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Ghost is said to act, exert,
   and put forth his power in us; partly by moving upon and stirring up
   the grace we have received; partly by new supplies of grace from Jesus
   Christ, falling in with occasions for their exercise, raising good
   motions immediately or occasionally within us; -- all tending to our
   furtherance in obedience and walking with God. All these are we
   carefully to observe and take notice of, -- consider the fountain
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they come, and the end which they lead us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Hence have we
   communion with the Holy Ghost, when we can consider him by faith as the
   immediate author of all supplies, assistance, and the whole relief we
   have by grace; of all good actings, risings, motions in our hearts; of
   all strivings and contending against sin. When we consider, I say, all
   these his actings and workings in their tendency to our consolation,
   and on that account are careful and watchful to improve them all to the
   end aimed at, as coming from him who is so loving, and kind, and tender
   to us, we have communion with him.
				</p><p>
   This is that which is intended, -- every gracious acting of the blessed
   Spirit in and towards our souls, is constantly by faith to be
   considered as coming from him in a peculiar manner; his mind, his
   goodwill is to be observed in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. Hence, care and diligence for the
   improvement of every motion of his will arise; thence reverence of his
   presence with us, with due spiritual regard to his holiness, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   ensue, and our souls are wonted to intercourse with him.
				</p><p>
   3. The third caution concerns him and his work, in the dispensation of
   that great ordinance of the word. Stephen tells the Jews, <reference osisRef="Acts.7.51">Acts 7:51</reference>,
   that they "resisted the Holy Ghost." How did they do it? Why, as their
   fathers did it: "As your fathers did, so do ye." How did their fathers
   resist the Holy Ghost? Verse 52, "They persecuted the prophets, and
   slew them;" their opposition to the prophets in preaching the gospel,
   or their showing of the coming of the Just One, was their resisting of
   the Holy Ghost. Now, the Holy Ghost is said to be resisted in the
   contempt of the preaching of the word; because the gift of preaching of
   it is from him. [361] "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to
   profit." Hence, when our Saviour promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> the Spirit to his disciples,
   to be present with them for the conviction of the world, he tells them
   he will give them a mouth and wisdom, which their adversaries shall not
   be able to gainsay nor resist, <reference osisRef="Luke.21.15">Luke 21:15</reference>; concerning which, in the
   accomplishment of it in Stephen, it is said that they "were not able to
   resist the Spirit by which he spake," <reference osisRef="Acts.6.10">Acts 6:10</reference> The Holy Ghost then
   setting up a ministry in the church, separating men thereto, furnishing
   them with gifts and abilities for the dispensation of the word; the not
   obeying of that word, opposing of it, not falling down before it, is
   called resisting of the Holy Ghost. This, in the examples of the
   wickedness of others, are we cautioned against. And this inwraps the
   third general rule of our communion with the Holy Ghost:  in the
   dispensation of the word of the gospel, the authority, wisdom, and
   goodness of the Holy Ghost, in furnishing men with gifts for that end
   and purpose, and his presence with them, as to the virtue of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, is
   to be eyed, and subjection given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it on that account. On this
   reason, I say, on this ground, is obedience to be yielded to the word,
   in the ministerial dispensation of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, -- because the Holy Ghost, and
   he alone, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> furnish with gifts to that end and purpose. When this
   consideration causes<note n="causeth">Auto-modernized</note> us to fall low before the word, then have we
   communion with the Holy Ghost in that ordinance. But this is commonly
   spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.

<title>Part 3 Chapter 8</title>
<p>
   Particular directions for communion with the Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   Before I name particular directions for our communion with the Holy
   Ghost, I must premise some cautions, as far as the directions to be
   given, concerning his worship.
				</p><p>
   First. The divine nature is the reason and cause of all worship; so
   that it is impossible to worship any one person, and not worship the
   whole Trinity. It is, and that not without ground, denied by the
   schoolmen, that the formal reason and object of divine worship is in
   the persons precisely considered; that is, under the
   formally-constitutive reason of their personality, which is their
   relation to each other. But this belongs to the divine nature and
   essence, and to their distinct persons as they are identified with the
   essence itself. Hence is that way of praying to the Trinity, by the
   repetition of the same petition to the several persons (as in the
   Litany), groundless, if not impious. It supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> that one person is
   worshipped, and not another, when each person is worshipped as God, and
   each person is so; -- as though we first should desire one thing of the
   Father, and be heard and granted by him, then ask the same thing of the
   Son, and so of the Holy Ghost; and so act as to the same thing three
   distinct acts of worship, and expect to be heard and have the same
   thing granted three times distinctly, when all the works of the
   Trinity, ad extra, are indivisible.
				</p><p>
   The proper and peculiar object of divine worship and invocation is the
   essence of God, in its infinite excellency, dignity, majesty, and its
   causality, as the first sovereign cause of all things. Now, this is
   common to all the three persons, and is proper to each of them; not
   formally as a person, but as God blessed for ever. All adoration
   respects that which is common to all; so that in each act of adoration
   and worship, all are adored and worshipped. The creatures worship their
   Creator; and a man, him in whose image he was created, -- namely, him
   "from whom descends<note n="descendeth">Auto-modernized</note> every good and perfect gift:" all this describing
   God as God. Hence, --
				</p><p>
   Secondly. When we begin our prayers to God the Father, and end them in
   the name of Jesus Christ, yet the Son is no less invocated and
   worshipped in the beginning than the Father, though he be peculiarly
   mentioned as mediator in the close, -- not as Son to himself, but as
   mediator to the whole Trinity, or God in Trinity. But in the invocation
   of God the Father we invocate every person; because we invocate the
   Father as God, every person being so.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly. In that heavenly directory which we have, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference>, this
   whole business is declared. Our access in our worship is said to be "to
   the Father;" and this "through Christ," or his mediation; "by the
   Spirit," or his assistance. Here is a distinction of the persons, as to
   their operations, but not at all as to their being the object of our
   worship. For the Son and the Holy Ghost are no less worshipped in our
   access to God than the Father himself; only, the grace of the Father,
   which we obtain by the mediation of the Son and the assistance of the
   Spirit, is that which we draw nigh to God for. So that when, by the
   distinct dispensation of the Trinity, and every person, we are led to
   worship (that is, to act faith on or invocate) any person, we do in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   worship the whole Trinity; and every person, by what name soever, of
   Father, Son, or Holy Ghost, we invocate him. So that this is to be
   observed in this whole matter, -- that when any work of the Holy Ghost
   (or any other person), which is appropriated to him (we never exclude
   the concurrence of other persons), draws us to the worship of him, yet
   he is not worshipped exclusively, but the whole Godhead is worshipped.
				</p><p>
   Fourthly. These cautions being premised, I say that we are distinctly
   to worship the Holy Ghost. As it is in the case of faith in respect of
   the Father and the Son, <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>, "Believe in God, believe also in
   me," -- this extends itself no less to the Holy Ghost. Christ called
   the disciples for the acting of faith on him, he being upon the
   accomplishment of the great work of his mediation; and the Holy Ghost,
   now carrying on the work of his delegation, requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> the same. And to
   the same purpose are their distinct operations mentioned: "My Father
   works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> hitherto, and I work." Now, as the formal reason of the worship
   of the Son is not his mediation, but his being God (his mediation being
   a powerful motive thereto), so the formal reason of our worshipping the
   Holy Ghost is not his being our comforter, but his being God; yet his
   being our comforter is a powerful motive to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   This is the sum of the first direction:  the grace, actings, love,
   effects of the Holy Ghost, as he is our comforter, ought to stir us up
   and provoke us to love, worship, believe in, and invocate him; --
   though all this, being directed to him as God, is no less directed, on
   that account, to the other persons than to him. Only by the fruits of
   his love towards us are we stirred up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it.
				</p><p>
   These things being presupposed, let the saints learn to act faith
   distinctly on the Holy Ghost, as the immediate efficient cause of all
   the good things mentioned; -- faith, I say, to believe in him; and
   faith in all things to believe him and to yield obedience to him;
   faith, not imagination. The distinction of the persons in the Trinity
   is not to be fancied, but believed. So, then, the Scripture so fully,
   frequently, clearly, distinctly ascribing the things we have been
   speaking of to the immediate efficiency of the Holy Ghost, faith closes
   with him in the truth revealed, and peculiarly regards him, worships
   him, serves him, waits for him, prays<note n="prayeth">Auto-modernized</note> to him, praises<note n="praiseth">Auto-modernized</note> him; -- all
   these things, I say, the saints do in faith. The person of the Holy
   Ghost, revealing itself in these operations and effects, is the
   peculiar object of our worship. Therefore, when he ought to be
   peculiarly honoured, and is not, he is peculiarly sinned against. <reference osisRef="Acts.5.3">Acts 5:3</reference>, Ananias is said to lie to the Holy Ghost, -- not to God; which
   being taken essentially, would denote the whole Trinity, but peculiarly
   to the Holy Ghost. Him he was to have honoured peculiarly in that
   special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> gift of his which he made profession of; -- not doing it, he
   sinned peculiarly against him. But this must be a little farther
   branched into particulars: 
				</p><p>
   Let us, then, lay weight on every effect of the Holy Ghost in any of
   the particulars before mentioned, on this account, that they are acts
   of his love and power towards us. This faith will do, that takes notice
   of his kindness in all things. Frequently he performs, in sundry
   particulars, the office of a comforter towards us, and we are not
   thoroughly comforted, -- we take no notice at all of what he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>. Then
   is he grieved. Of those who do receive and own the consolation he
   tenders and administers, how few are there that consider him as the
   comforter, and rejoice in him as they ought! Upon every work of
   consolation that the believer receives, this ought his faith to resolve
   upon, -- "This is from the Holy Ghost; he is the Comforter, the God of
   all consolation; I know there is no joy, peace, hope, nor comfort, but
   what he works, gives, and bestows; and, that he might give me this
   consolation, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> willingly condescended to this office of a
   comforter. His love was in it, and on that account does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he continue it.
   Also, he is sent by the Father and Son for that end and purpose. By
   this means come I to be partaker of my joy, -- it is in the Holy Ghost;
   of consolation, -- he is the Comforter. What price, now, shall I set
   upon his love! how shall I value the mercy that I have received!"
				</p><p>
   This, I say, is applicable to every particular effect of the Holy Ghost
   towards us, and in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> have we communion and fellowship with him, as
   was in part discovered in our handling the particulars. Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he shed
   abroad the love of God in our hearts? does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he witness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   adoption? The soul considers his presence, ponders his love, his
   condescension, goodness, and kindness; is filled with reverence of him,
   and cares [takes care] not to grieve him, and labours to preserve his
   temple, his habitation, pure and holy.
				</p><p>
   Again: our communion with him causes<note n="causeth">Auto-modernized</note> in us returning praise, and
   thanks, and honour, and glory, and blessing to him, on the account of
   the mercies and privileges which we receive from him; which are many.
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> consists our next direction. So do we with the Son of God on the
   account of our redemption: "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that loved us, and washed us from
   our sins in his own blood, to him be glory and dominion for ever and
   ever," <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5-Rev.1.6">Revelation of John 1:5-6</reference> And are not the like praises and blessings due to
   him by whom the work of redemption is made effectual to us? who with no
   less infinite love undertook our consolation than the Son our
   redemption. When we feel our hearts warmed with joy, supported in
   peace, established in our obedience, let us ascribe to him the praise
   that is due to him, bless his name, and rejoice in him.
				</p><p>
   And this glorifying of the Holy Ghost in thanksgivings, on a spiritual
   sense of his consolations, is no small part of our communion with him.
   Considering his free engagement in this work, his coming forth from the
   Father to this purpose, his mission by the Son, and condescension
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, his love and kindness, the soul of a believer is poured out in
   thankful praises to him, and is sweetly affected with the duty. There
   is no duty that leaves a more heavenly savour in the soul than this
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Also, in our prayers to him for the carrying on the work of our
   consolation, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> undertaken, lies our communion with him.
   John prays for grace and peace from the seven Spirits that are before
   the throne, or the Holy Ghost, whose operations are perfect and
   complete. This part of his worship is expressly mentioned frequently in
   Scripture; and all others do necessarily attend it. Let the saints
   consider what need they stand in of these effects of the Holy Ghost
   before mentioned, with many such others as might be insisted on; weigh
   all the privileges which we are made partakers of; remember that he
   distributes them as he will, that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the sovereign disposal of
   them; and they will be prepared for this duty.
				</p><p>
   How and in what sense it is to be performed has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been already declared:
   what is the formal reason of this worship, and ultimate object of it, I
   have also manifested. In the duty itself is put forth no small part of
   the life, efficacy, and vigour of faith; and we come short of that
   enlargedness of spirit in dealing with God, and are straitened from
   walking in the breadth of his ways, which we are called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, if we
   learn not ourselves to meet him with his worship in every way he is
   pleased to communicate himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. In these things he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so in
   the person of the Holy Ghost. In that person do we meet him, his love,
   grace, and authority, by our prayers and supplications.
				</p><p>
   Again: consider him as he condescends to this delegation of the Father
   and the Son to be our comforter, and ask him daily of the Father in the
   name of Jesus Christ. This is the daily work of believers. They look
   upon, and by faith consider, the Holy Ghost as promised to be sent. In
   this promise, they know, lies all their grace, peace, mercy, joy, and
   hope. For by him so promised, and him alone, are these things
   communicated to them. If, therefore, our life to God, or the joy of
   that life, be considerable, in this we are to abound, -- to ask him of
   the Father, as children do of their parents daily bread. And as, in
   this asking and receiving of the Holy Ghost, we have communion with the
   Father in his love, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is sent; and with the Son in his grace,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he is obtained for us; so with himself, on the account of his
   voluntary condescension to this dispensation. Every request for the
   Holy Ghost implies our closing with all these. O the riches of the
   grace of God!
				</p><p>
   Humbling ourselves for our miscarriages in reference to him is another
   part of our communion with him. That we have grieved him as to his
   person, quenched him as to the motion of his grace, or resisted him in
   his ordinances, is to be mourned for; as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been declared. Let our
   souls be humbled before him on this account. This one considerable
   ingredient of godly sorrow, and the thoughts of it, are as suitable to
   the affecting of our hearts with humiliation, and indignation against
   sin, as any other whatever. I might proceed in the like considerations;
   as also make application of them to the particular effects of the Holy
   Ghost enumerated; but my design is only to point out the heads of
   things, and to leave them to the improvement of others.
				</p><p>
   I shall shut up this whole discourse with some considerations of the
   sad estate and condition of men not interested in this promise of the
   Spirit, nor made partakers of his consolation: 
				</p><p>
   1. They have no true consolation or comfort, be their estate and
   condition what it will. Are they under affliction or in trouble? --
   they must bear their own burden; and how much too weak they are for it,
   if God be pleased to lay on his hand with more weight than ordinary, is
   easily known. Men may have stoutness of spirit, and put on great
   resolutions to wrestle with their troubles; but when this is merely
   from the natural spirit of a man, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) For the most part it is but an outside. It is done with respect to
   others, that they may not appear low-spirited or dejected. Their hearts
   are eaten up and devoured with troubles and anxiety of mind. Their
   thoughts are perplexed, and they are still striving, but never come to
   a conquest. Every new trouble, every little alteration in their trials,
   puts them to new vexation. It is an ungrounded resolution that bears
   them up, and they are easily shaken.
				</p><p>
   (2.) What is the best of their resolves and enduring? It is but a
   contending with God, who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> entangled them, -- the struggling of a
   flea under a mountain. Yea, though, on outward considerations and
   principles, they endeavour after patience and tolerance, yet all is but
   a contending with God, -- a striving to be quiet under that which God
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent on purpose to disturb them. God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not afflict men without
   the Spirit, to exercise their patience; but to disturb their peace and
   security. All their arming themselves with patience and resolution, is
   but to keep the hold that God will cast them out of, or else make them
   the nearer to ruin. This is the best of their consolation in the time
   of their trouble.
				</p><p>
   (3.) If they do promise themselves any thing of the care of God towards
   them, and relieve themselves thereby, -- as they often do, on one
   account or another, especially when they are driven from other holds,
   -- all their relief is but like the dreaming of an hungry man, who
   supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> that he eats<note n="eateth">Auto-modernized</note> and drinks<note n="drinketh">Auto-modernized</note>, and is refreshed; but when he
   awakes<note n="awaketh">Auto-modernized</note>, he is empty and disappointed. So are they as to all their
   relief that they promise to receive from God, and the support which
   they seem to have from him. When they are awaked at the latter day, and
   see all things clearly, they will find that God was their enemy,
   laughing at their calamity, and mocking when their fear was on them.
				</p><p>
   So is it with them in trouble. Is it any better with them in their
   prosperity? This, indeed, is often great, and is marvellously described
   in Scripture, as to their lives, and oftentimes quiet, peaceable end.
   But have they any true consolation all their days? They eat, drink,
   sleep, and make merry, and perhaps heap up to themselves; but how
   little do these things make them to differ from the beasts that perish!
   Solomon's advantage, to have the use and know the utmost of these
   things, much beyond any of the sons of men of our generation, is
   commonly taken notice of. The account also that he gives of them is
   known: "They are all vanity and vexation of spirit." This is their
   consolation:  a crackling of thorns under the pot, a sudden flash and
   blaze, that begins but to perish. So that both adversity and prosperity
   slays<note n="slayeth">Auto-modernized</note> them; and whether they are laughing or crying, they are still
   dying.
				</p><p>
   2. They have no peace, -- no peace with God, nor in their own souls. I
   know that many of them, upon false bottoms, grounds, and expectations,
   do make a shift to keep things in some quietness, neither is it my
   business at present to discover the falseness and unsoundness of it;
   but this is their state. True and solid peace being an effect of the
   Holy Ghost in the hearts of believers (as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been declared), they who
   are not made partakers of him have no such peace. They may cry, "Peace,
   peace," indeed, when sudden destruction is at hand. The principles of
   their peace (as may be easily evinced) are, darkness or ignorance,
   treachery of conscience, self-righteousness, and vain hope. To these
   heads may all the principles of their peace be reduced; and what will
   these avail them in the day when the Lord shall deal with them?
				</p><p>
   3. I might say the same concerning their joy and hope; -- they are
   false and perishing. Let them, then, consider this, who have satisfied
   themselves with a persuasion of their interest in the good things of
   the gospel, and yet have despised the Spirit of Christ. I know there
   are many that may pretend to him, and yet are strangers from his grace;
   but if they perish who in profession use him kindly, and honour him, if
   he dwell not in them with power, where shall they appear who oppose and
   affront him? The Scripture tells us, that unless the Spirit of Christ
   be in us, we are dead, we are reprobates, -- we are none of Christ's.
   Without him you can have none of those glorious effects of his towards
   believers before mentioned; and you are so far from inquiring whether
   he be in you or no, as that you are ready to deride them in whom he is.
   Are there none who profess the gospel, who have never once seriously
   inquired whether they are made partakers of the Holy Ghost or no? You
   that almost account it a ridiculous thing to be put upon any such
   question, who look on all men as vain pretenders that talk of the
   Spirit, the Lord awake such men to a sight of their condition before it
   be too late! If the Spirit dwell not in you, if he be not your
   Comforter, neither is God your Father, nor the Son your Advocate, nor
   have you any portion in the gospel. O that God would awake some poor
   soul to the consideration of this thing, before the neglect and
   contempt of the Holy Ghost come to that despising of him from which
   there is no recovery! that the Lord would spread before them all the
   folly of their hearts, that they may be ashamed and confounded, and do
   no more presumptuously!</p>

<title>A vindication </title>
<p>of some passages 
				</p><p>
   in a discourse concerning communion with God
				</p><p>
   from
				</p><p>
   the exceptions of William Sherlock,
				</p><p>
   Rector of St George, Botolph Lane
</p>

<title>Prefatory Note.</title>
<p>   William Sherlock, father of Dr Thomas Sherlock, an eminent bishop of
   London, was himself distinguished as an author, and mingled deeply in
   the controversies of his day. His strictures on Owen's work on
   Communion with God appeared in 1674, after that work had been seventeen
   years before the public. It seems to have been Sherlock's first
   appearance in authorship; and some of his subsequent treatises such as
   those on Providence and on Death afford a better specimen of his
   abilities. They are destitute of evangelical principle and feeling, and
   imbued throughout with a freezing rationalism of tone; but,
   nevertheless, contain some views of the Divine administration, acutely
   conceived and ably stated. He became rector of St George, Botolph Lane,
   received a prebend in St Paul's, and was appointed Master of the Temple
   about 1684. His conduct at the Revolution was not straightforward, and
   laid him open to the reproaches of the Jacobites, who blamed him for
   deserting their party. There was a controversy of some importance
   between him and Dr South. The latter, on the ground of some expressions
   in the work by the former on the Trinity (1690), accused him of
   Tritheism. Sherlock retorted by accusing his critic of Sabellianism. He
   died in 1707, at the age of sixty-six.
				</p><p>
   Sherlock's work against Owen was entitled, "A Discourse concerning the
   Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and on Union and Communion with Him," etc.
   Owen confines himself, in his reply, to an exposure of the
   misrepresentations in which Sherlock had indulged. The latter, for
   example, sought to fix on the Puritan divine the doctrine, that the
   knowledge of divine things was to be obtained from the person of
   Christ, apart from the truth as revealed in the Scriptures. Our author
   successfully vindicates himself from this charge, and repudiates other
   sentiments equally mystical, and ascribed to him with equal injustice.
   The views of Sherlock, on the points at issue, have been termed, "a
   confused mass of Socinianized Arminianism." Owen evinces a strength of
   feeling, in some parts of his "Vindication," which may be accounted for
   on the ground that he resented the attack as part of a systematic
   effort made at this time to destroy his standing and reputation as an
   author. In the main, there is a dignity in his statements which
   contrasts well with the wayward petulance of his antagonist; and
   occasionally the reader will find a vein of quiet and skilful irony, in
   the way in which he disposes of the crude views of Sherlock.
				</p><p>
   Such was the beginning of the Communion Controversy, which soon
   embraced a wider range of topics, and points of more importance, than
   the merits of Owen's book. Besides the original disputants, others
   entered the field. Robert Ferguson in 1675, wrote against Sherlock a
   volume entitled, "The Interest of Reason in Religion," etc. Edward
   Polhill followed, in "An Answer to the Discourse of Mr William
   Sherlock," etc. Vincent Alsop first displayed in this controversy his
   powers of wit and acumen as an author, in his "Antisozzo, or
   Sherlocismus Enervatus." Henry Hickman, a man of considerable gifts,
   and pastor of an English congregation at Leyden, wrote the "Speculum
   Sherlockianum," etc. Samuel Rolle, a nonconformist, wrote the
   "Prodromus, or the Character of Mr Sherlock's Book;" and also, in the
   same controversy, "Justification Justified." Thomas Danson, who had
   been ejected from Sibton, and author of several works against the
   Quakers, wrote "The Friendly Debate between Satan and Sherlock," and
   afterwards he published again in defence of it. Sherlock, in 1675,
   replied to Owen and Ferguson in his "Defence and Continuation of the
   Discourse concerning the Knowledge of Jesus Christ." He was supported
   by Thomas Hotchkis, Rector of Staunton, in a "Discourse concerning the
   Imputation of Christ's Righteousness," etc. The singular diligence of
   Mr Orme has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> compiled this full list of the works published in this
   controversy; but he is not quite correct in affirming that it was
   closed by the replies of Sherlock and Hotchkis in 1675. A second part
   of the work by Hotchkis appeared in 1678, and Sherlock was the author
   of two other works, "An Answer to Thomas Danson's scandalous pamphlet,
   entitled A Friendly Conference,'?" etc., which appeared in 1677, and
   was followed by a "Vindication of Mr Sherlock against the Cavils of Mr
   Danson." -- Ed.

<title>A Vindication of some Passages in a Discourse concerning Communion with God.</title>
<p>   It is now near twenty years since I wrote and published a Discourse
   concerning Communion with God. Of what use and advantage it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   to any, as to their furtherance in the design aimed at in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, is left
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them to judge by whom it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been perused with any candid
   diligence; and I do know that multitudes of persons fearing God, and
   desiring to walk before him in sincerity, are ready, if occasion
   require, to give testimony to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the benefit which they have received
   thereby; -- as I can also at any time produce the testimonies of [as]
   learned and holy persons, it may be, as any I know living, both in
   England and out of it, who, owning the truth contained in it, have
   highly avowed its usefulness, and are ready yet so to do. With all
   other persons, so far as ever I heard, it passed at the rate of a
   tolerable acceptation with discourses of the same kind and nature. And
   however any thing or passage in it might not, possibly, suit the
   apprehensions of some, yet, being wholly practical, designed for
   popular edification, without any direct engagement into things
   controversial, I looked for no opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it or exception against
   it; but that it would at least be suffered to pass at that rate of
   allowance which is universally granted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that sort of writings, both
   of ancient and modern authors. Accordingly it so fell out, and
   continued for many years; until some persons began to judge it their
   interest, and to make it their business, to cavil at my writings, and
   to load my person with reproaches. With what little success, as to
   their avowed designs, they have laboured in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, -- how openly their
   endeavours are sunk into contempt with all sorts of persons pretending
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the least sobriety or modesty, -- I suppose they are not
   themselves altogether insensible. Among the things which this sort of
   men sought to make an advantage of against me, I found that two or
   three of them began to reflect on that discourse; though it appeared
   they had not satisfied themselves what as yet to fix upon, their
   nibbling cavils being exceedingly ridiculous.
				</p><p>
   But yet, from those intimations of some men's good-will towards it, --
   sufficient to provoke the industry of such as either needed their
   assistance or valued their favour, -- I was in expectation that one or
   other would possess that province, and attempt the whole discourse or
   some parts of it. Nor was I dissatisfied in my apprehensions of that
   design; for, being earnestly solicited to suffer it to be reprinted, I
   was very willing to see what either could or would be objected against
   it before it received another impression. For whereas it was written
   now near twenty years ago, when there was the deepest peace in the
   minds of all men about the things treated of in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, and when I had no
   apprehension of any dissent from the principal design, scope, and parts
   of it by any called Christians in the world, the Socinians only
   excepted (whom I had in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> no regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>), I thought it highly
   probable that some things might have been so expressed as to render a
   review and amendment to them more than ordinarily necessary. And I
   reckoned it not improbable, but that from one malevolent adversary I
   might receive a more instructive information of such escapes of
   diligence than I could do in so long a time from all the more impartial
   readers of it; for as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the substance of the doctrine declared in
   it, I was sufficiently secure, not only of its truth, but that it would
   immovably endure the rudest assaults of such oppositions as I did
   expect. I was therefore very well satisfied when I heard of the
   publishing of this treatise of Mr Sherlock's, -- which, as I was
   informed, and since have found true, was principally intended against
   myself, and that discourse (that is, that book), because I was the
   author of it, which will at last prove it to be its only guilt and
   crime; -- for I thought I should be at once now satisfied, both what it
   was which was so long contriving against it (of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> I could give no
   conjecture), as also be directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any such mistakes as might have
   befallen me in matter or manner of expression, which I would or might
   rectify before the book received another edition. But, upon a view and
   perusal of this discourse, I found myself under a double surprisal.
   For, first, in reference to my own, I could not find any thing, any
   doctrine, any expressions, any words reflected on, which the exceptions
   of this man do give me the least occasion to alter, or to desire that
   they had been otherwise either expressed or delivered; -- not any thing
   which now, after near twenty years, I do not still equally approve of,
   and which I am not yet ready to justify. The other part of my surprisal
   was somewhat particular, though, in truth, it ought to have been none
   at all; and this was with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those doctrinal principles which
   he manages<note n="manageth">Auto-modernized</note> his oppositions upon. A surprisal they were to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me,
   because wild, uncouth, extravagant, and contrary to the common faith of
   Christians, -- being all of them traduced, [362] and some of them
   transcribed, from the writings of the Socinians; [while] yet [they]
   ought not to have been so, because I was assured that an opposition
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that discourse could be managed on no other [ground]. But,
   however, the doctrine maintained by this man, and those opposed or
   scorned by him, are not my special concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>; for what is it to me
   what the Rector of etc., preaches<note n="preacheth">Auto-modernized</note> or publishes<note n="publisheth">Auto-modernized</note>, beyond my common
   interest in the truths of the gospel, with other men as great strangers
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as myself, who to my knowledge never saw him, nor heard of his
   name till infamed by his book? Only, I shall take leave to say, that
   the doctrine here published, and licensed so to be, is either the
   doctrine of the present church of England, or it is not. If it be so, I
   shall be forced to declare that I neither have, nor will have, any
   communion in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; and that, as for other reasons, so in particular,
   because I will not renounce or depart from that which I know to be the
   true, ancient, and catholic doctrine of this church. If it be not so,
   -- as I am assured, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> many bishops and other learned
   men, that it is not, -- it is certainly the concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of them who
   preside in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> to take care that such kind of discourses be not
   countenanced with the stamp of their public authority, lest they and
   the church be represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a great disadvantage with many.
				</p><p>
   It was some months after the publishing of this discourse, before I
   entertained any thoughts of taking the least notice of it, -- yea, I
   was resolved to the contrary, and declared those resolutions as I had
   occasion; neither was it until very lately that my second thoughts came
   to a compliance with the desires of some others, to consider my own
   peculiar concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And this is all which I now design; for
   the examination of the opinions which this author has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> vented under the
   countenance of public licence, whatever they may think, I know to be
   more the concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of other men than mine. Nor yet do I enter into
   the consideration of what is written by this author with the least
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> myself, or my own reputation, which I have the
   satisfaction to conceive not to be prejudiced by such pitiful attempts;
   nor have I the least desire to preserve it in the minds of such persons
   as in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it can suffer on this occasion. But the vindication of some
   sacred truths, petulantly traduced by this author, seems to be cast on
   me in a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner; because he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> opposed them, and endeavoured
   to expose them to scorn, as declared in my book; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> others, more
   meet for this work, might think themselves discharged from taking
   notice of them. Setting aside this consideration, I can freely give
   this sort of men leave to go on with their revilings and scoffings
   until they are weary or ashamed; which, as far as I can discern, upon
   consideration of their ability for such a work, and their confidence
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, is not like to be in haste; -- at least, they can change their
   course, and when they are out of breath in pursuit of one sort of
   calumnies, betake themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another. Witness the late malicious,
   and yet withal ridiculous, reports that they have divulged concerning
   me, even with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> civil affairs, and their industry in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>;
   for although they were such as had not any thing of the least
   probability or likelihood to give them countenance, yet were they so
   impetuously divulged, and so readily entertained by many, as made me
   think there was more than the common artifices of calumny employed in
   their raising and improvement, especially considering what persons I
   can justly charge those reports upon. But in this course they may
   proceed while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> they please and think convenient: I find myself no more
   concerned in what they write or say of this nature than if it were no
   more but, --
				</p><p>
   ? epei ete kako out' aphroni photi eoikas. [363]
				</p><p>
   Oule te, kai mega chaire, Theoi de toi olbia doie. [364]
				</p><p>
   It is the doctrine traduced only that I am concerned about, and that as
   it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been the doctrine of the church of England.
				</p><p>
   It may be it will be said (for there is no security against confidence
   and immodesty, backed with secular advantages), that the doctrinal
   principles asserted in this book are agreeable with the doctrine of the
   church in former times; and therefore those opposed in it, such as are
   condemned thereby. Hereabout I shall make no long contest with them who
   once discover that their minds are by any means emboldened to undertake
   the defence of such shameless untruths; nor shall I multiply
   testimonies to prove the contrary, which others are more concerned to
   do, if they intend not to betray the religion of that church with whose
   preservation and defence they are intrusted. Only, because there are
   ancient divines of this church, who, I am persuaded, will be allowed
   with the most to have known as well the doctrine of it, and as firmly
   to have adhered to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, as this author, who have particularly spoken
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> most of the things which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> opposed, or rather reproached, I
   shall transcribe the words of one of them, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he, and those who
   employ him, may be minded with whom they have to do in those things.
   For, as to the writers of the ancient church, there is in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> no regard
   had to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. He whom I shall name is Mr Hooker, and that in his
   famous book of "Ecclesiastical Polity;" who, in the fifth book of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>,
   and 56th paragraph, thus discourses<note n="discourseth">Auto-modernized</note>: 
				</p><p>
   "We have hitherto spoken of the person and of the presence of Christ.
   Participation is that mutual inward hold which Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> of us, and
   we of him, in such sort that each possesses<note n="possesseth">Auto-modernized</note> other by way of special
   interest, property, and inherent copulation." And after the
   interposition of some things conceding the mutual in-being and love of
   the Father and the Son, he thus proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note>:  "We are by nature the
   sons of Adam. When God created Adam, he created us; and as many as are
   descended from Adam have in themselves the root out of which they
   spring. The sons of God we neither are all nor any one of us, otherwise
   than only by grace and favour. The sons of God have God's own natural
   Son as a second Adam from heaven; whose race and progeny they are by
   spiritual and heavenly birth. God therefore loving eternally his Son,
   he must needs eternally in him have loved, and preferred before all
   others, them which are spiritually since descended and sprung out of
   him. These were in God as in their Saviour, and not as in their Creator
   only. It was the purpose of his saving goodness, his saving wisdom, and
   his saving power, which inclined itself towards them. They which thus
   were in God eternally by their intended admission to life, have, by
   vocation or adoption, God actually now in them, as the artificer is in
   the work which his hand does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> presently frame. Life, as all other gifts
   and benefits, grows<note n="groweth">Auto-modernized</note> originally from the Father, and comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note> not to us
   but by the Son, nor by the Son to any of us in particular, but through
   the Spirit. For this cause the apostle wishes<note n="wisheth">Auto-modernized</note> to the church of
   Corinth, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
   the fellowship of the Holy Ghost;' which three St Peter comprehends<note n="comprehendeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   in one, -- the participation of the divine nature. We are, therefore,
   in God through Christ eternally, according to that intent and purpose
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are chosen to be made his in this present world before the
   world itself was made. We are in God through the knowledge which is had
   of us, and the love which is borne towards us from everlasting; but in
   God we actually are no longer than only from the time of our actual
   adoption into the body of his true church, into the fellowship of his
   children. For his church he knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> and loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>; so that they which are
   in the church are thereby known to be in him. Our being in Christ by
   eternal foreknowledge saves<note n="saveth">Auto-modernized</note> us not, without our actual and real
   adoption into the fellowship of his saints in this present world. For
   in him we actually are by our actual incorporation into that society
   which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> him for their head, and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> make together with him one body
   (he and they in that respect having one name); for which cause, by
   virtue of this mystical union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>, we are of him, and in him, even as
   though our very flesh and bones should be made continuate with his. We
   are in Christ, because he knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> and loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> us, even as parts of
   himself. No man is actually in him but they in whom he actually is; for
   he which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not the Son of God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not life. I am the vine, ye are
   the branches: he that abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note> in me, and I in him, the same brings<note n="bringeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   forth much fruit;' but the branch severed from the vine withers<note n="withereth">Auto-modernized</note>. We
   are, therefore, adopted sons of God to eternal life by participation of
   the only begotten Son of God, whose life is the well-spring and cause
   of ours. It is too cold an interpretation, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> some men expound our
   being in Christ to import nothing else but only that the self-same
   nature which makes<note n="maketh">Auto-modernized</note> us to be men is in him, and makes<note n="maketh">Auto-modernized</note> him man as we
   are. For what man in the world is there which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not so far forth
   communion with Jesus Christ? It is not this that can sustain the weight
   of such sentences as speak of the mystery of our coherence with Jesus
   Christ. The church is in Christ, as Eve was in Adam. Yea, by grace we
   are every [one] of us in Christ and in his church, as by nature we were
   in those, our first parents. God made Eve of the rib of Adam; and his
   church he frames<note n="frameth">Auto-modernized</note> out of the very flesh, the very wounded and bleeding
   side, of the Son of man. His body crucified, and his blood shed for the
   life of the world, are the true elements of that heavenly being which
   makes<note n="maketh">Auto-modernized</note> us such as himself is of whom we come. For which cause the words
   of Adam may be fitly the words of Christ concerning his church, Flesh
   of my flesh, and bone of my bones;' -- A true nature, extract out of
   mine own body.' So that in him, even according to his manhood, we,
   according to our heavenly being, are as branches in that root out of
   which they grow. To all things he is life, and to men light, as the Son
   of God; to the church, both life and light eternal, by being made the
   Son of man for us, and by being in us a Saviour, whether we respect him
   as God or as man. Adam is in us as an original cause of our nature, and
   of that corruption of nature which causes<note n="causeth">Auto-modernized</note> death; Christ as the cause
   original of restoration to life. The person of Adam is not in us, but
   his nature, and the corruption of his nature, derived into all men by
   propagation. Christ having Adam's nature, as we have, but incorrupt,
   derives<note n="deriveth">Auto-modernized</note> not nature but incorruption, and that immediately from his own
   person, into all that belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. As, therefore, we are really
   partakers of the body of sin and death received from Adam; so, except
   we be truly partakers of Christ, and as really possessed of his Spirit,
   all we speak of eternal life is but a dream. That which quickens<note n="quickeneth">Auto-modernized</note> us
   is the Spirit of the second Adam, and his flesh that with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he
   quickens<note n="quickeneth">Auto-modernized</note>. That which in him made our nature incorrupt was the union
   of his Deity with our nature. And in that respect the sentence of death
   and condemnation, which only takes<note n="taketh">Auto-modernized</note> hold upon sinful flesh, could no
   way possibly extend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. This caused his voluntary death for
   others to prevail with God, and to have the force of an expiatory
   sacrifice. The blood of Christ, as the apostle witnesses<note n="witnesseth">Auto-modernized</note>, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>,
   therefore, take away sin; because, Through the eternal Spirit he
   offered himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God without spot.' That which sanctified our
   nature in Christ, -- that which made it a sacrifice available to take
   away sin, is the same which quickened it, raised it out of the grave
   after death, and exalted it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> glory. Seeing, therefore, that Christ
   is in us a quickening Spirit, the first degree of communion with Christ
   must needs consist in the participation of his Spirit, which Cyprian in
   that respect terms germanissimam societatem,' -- the highest and truest
   society that can be between man and him, which is both God and man in
   one. These things St Cyril duly considering, reproves<note n="reproveth">Auto-modernized</note> their speeches
   which taught that only the Deity of Christ is the vine whereupon we by
   faith do depend as branches, and that neither his flesh nor our bodies
   are comprised in this resemblance. For does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> any man doubt but that even
   from the flesh of Christ our very bodies do receive that life which
   shall make them glorious at the latter day; and for which they are
   already accounted parts of his blessed body? Our corruptible bodies
   could never live the life they shall live, were it not that here they
   are joined with his body, which is incorruptible; and that his is in
   ours as a cause of immortality, -- a cause, by removing, through the
   death and merit of his own flesh, that which hindered the life of ours.
   Christ is, therefore, both as God and as man, that true vine of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we
   both spiritually and corporally are branches. The mixture of his bodily
   substance with ours is a thing which the ancient fathers disclaim. Yet
   the mixture of his flesh with ours they speak of, to signify what our
   very bodies, through mystical union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>, receive from that vital
   efficacy which we know to be in his; and from bodily mixtures they
   borrow divers similitudes, rather to declare the truth than the manner
   of coherence between his sacred [body] and the sanctified bodies of
   saints. Thus much no Christian man will deny, that when Christ
   sanctified his own flesh, giving as God, and taking as man, the Holy
   Ghost, he did not this for himself only, but for our sakes, that the
   grace of sanctification and life, which was first received in him,
   might pass from him to his whole race, as malediction came from Adam
   into all mankind. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, because the work of his Spirit to those
   effects is in us prevented by sin and death possessing us before, it is
   of necessity that as well our present sanctification into newness of
   life, as the future restoration of our bodies, should presuppose a
   participation of the grace, efficacy, merit, or virtue of his body and
   blood; -- without which foundation first laid, there is no place for
   those other operations of the Spirit of Christ to ensue. So that Christ
   imparts<note n="imparteth">Auto-modernized</note> plainly himself by degrees. It pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note> him, in mercy, to
   account himself incomplete and maimed without us. But most assured we
   are, that we all receive of his fulness, because he is in us as a
   moving and working cause; from which many blessed effects are really
   found to ensue, and that in sundry both kinds and degrees, all tending
   to eternal happiness. It must be confessed, that of Christ working as a
   creator and a governor of the world, by providence all are partakers;
   -- not all partakers of that grace through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he inhabits<note n="inhabiteth">Auto-modernized</note> whom he
   saves<note n="saveth">Auto-modernized</note>. Again: as he dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> not by grace in all, so neither does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he
   equally work in all them in whom he dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note>. From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> is it,' says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> St
   Augustine, that some be holier than others are, but because God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   dwell in some more plentifully than in others?' And because the divine
   substance of Christ is equally in all, his human substance equally
   distant from all, it appears<note n="appeareth">Auto-modernized</note> that the participation of Christ,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there are many degrees and differences, must needs consist in
   such effects as, being derived from both natures of Christ really into
   us, are made our own: and we, by having them in us, are truly said to
   have him from whom they come; Christ also, more or less, to inhabit and
   impart himself, as the graces are fewer or more, greater or smaller,
   which really flow into us from Christ. Christ is whole with the whole
   church, and whole with every part of the church, as touching his
   person, which can no way divide itself, or be possessed by degrees and
   portions. But the participation of Christ imports<note n="importeth">Auto-modernized</note>, besides the
   presence of Christ's person, and besides the mystical copulation
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> with the parts and members of his whole church, a true actual
   influence of grace, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the life which we live according to
   godliness is his; and from him we receive those perfections in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our
   eternal happiness consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note>. Thus we participate Christ:  partly by
   imputation; as when those things which he did and suffered for us are
   imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us for righteousness; partly by habitual and real
   infusion; as when grace is inwardly bestowed while we are on earth; --
   and afterward more fully, both our souls and bodies made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   in glory. The first thing of his so infused into our hearts in this
   life is the Spirit of Christ; whereupon, because the rest, of what kind
   soever, do all both necessarily depend and infallibly also ensue,
   therefore the apostles term it sometimes the seed of God, sometimes the
   pledge of our heavenly inheritance, sometimes the hansel or earnest of
   that which is to come. From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it is that they which belong to the
   mystical body of our Saviour Christ, and be in number as the stars of
   heaven, -- divided successively, by reason of their mortal condition,
   into many generations, -- are, notwithstanding, coupled every one to
   Christ their head, and all to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every particular person amongst
   themselves; inasmuch as the same Spirit which anointed the blessed soul
   of our Saviour Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so formalise, unite, and actuate his whole
   race, as if both he and they were so many limbs compacted into one
   body, by being quickened all with one and the same soul. That in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   we are partakers of Jesus Christ by imputation, agres<note n="agreeth">Auto-modernized</note> equally to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   all what have it; for it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in such acts and deeds of his as
   could not have longer continuance than while they were in doing, nor at
   that very time belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any other but to him from whom they come:
   and therefore, how men, either then, or before, or since, should be
   made partakers of them, there can be no way imagined but only by
   imputation. Again: a deed must either not be imputed to any, but rest
   altogether in him whose it is; or, if at all it be imputed, they which
   have it by imputation must have it such as it is, -- whole. So that
   degrees being neither in the personal presence of Christ, nor in the
   participation of those effects which are ours by imputation only, it
   rests<note n="resteth">Auto-modernized</note> that we wholly apply them to the participation of Christ's
   infused grace; although, even in this kind also, the first beginning of
   life, the seed of God, the first-fruits of Christ's Spirit, be without
   latitude. For we have hereby only the being of the sons of God: in
   which number, how far soever one may seem to excel another, yet
   touching this, that all are sons, they are all equals; some, happily,
   better sons than the rest are, but none any more a son than another.
   Thus, therefore, we see how the Father is in the Son, and the Son in
   the Father; how they both are in all things, and all things in them:
   what communion Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> with his church; how his church, and every
   member of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, is in him by original derivation, and he personally in
   them, by way of mystical association, wrought through the gift of the
   Holy Ghost; which they that are his receive from him, and, together
   with the same, what benefit soever the vital force of his body and
   blood may yield; -- yea, by steps and degrees they receive the complete
   measure of all such divine grace as does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> sanctify and save throughout,
   till the day of their final exaltation to a state of fellowship in
   glory with him, whose partakers they are now in those things that tend
   to glory."
				</p><p>
   This one testimony ought to be enough to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this sort of men, while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note>
   they are at any consistency with their own reputation: for it is
   evident that there is nothing concerning personal election, effectual
   vocation, justification by the imputation of the righteousness of
   Christ, participation of him, union of believers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and with his
   person, derivation of grace from him, etc., which are so reproached by
   our present author, but they are asserted by this great champion of the
   church of England, who undoubtedly knew the doctrine which it owned,
   and in his days approved, and that in such words and expressions, as
   remote from the sentiments, or at least as unsavoury to the palates, of
   these men, as any they except against in others.
				</p><p>
   And what themselves so severely charge on us in point of discipline,
   that nothing be spoken about it until all is answered that is written
   by Mr Hooker in its defence, may, I hope, not immodestly be so far
   returned, as to desire them that in point of doctrine they will grant
   us truce, until they have moved out of the way what is written to the
   same purpose by Mr Hooker. Why do not they speak to him to leave
   fooling, and to speak sense, as they do to others? But let these things
   be as they are; I have no special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in them, nor shall take
   any farther notice of them, but only as they influence the exceptions
   which this author makes to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> some passages in that book of mine. And in
   what I shall do in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, I shall take as little notice as may be of
   those scurrilous and reproachful expressions, which either his
   inclination or his circumstances induced him to make use of. If he be
   pleased with such a course of procedure, I can only assure him, that as
   to my concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>, I am not displeased; and so he is left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his full
   liberty for the future.
				</p><p>
   The first thing he quarrels about, is my asserting the necessity of
   acquaintance with the person of Christ; which expression he frequently
   makes use of afterward in a way of reproach. The use of the word
   "acquaintance," in this matter, is warranted by our translation of the
   Scripture, and that properly, where it is required of us to acquaint
   ourselves with God. And that I intended nothing thereby but the
   knowledge of Jesus Christ, is evident beyond any pretence to the
   contrary to be suggested by the most subtle or inventive malice. The
   crime, therefore, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> I am here charged, is my assertion that it
   is necessary that Christians should know Jesus Christ; which I have
   afterward increased, by affirming also that they ought to love him: for
   by Jesus Christ all the world of Christians intend the person of
   Christ; and the most of them, all of them, -- the Socinians only
   excepted, -- by his person, "the Word made flesh," or the Son of God
   incarnate, the mediator between God and man. For because the name
   Christ is sometimes used metonymically, to conclude thence that Jesus
   Christ is not Jesus Christ, or that it is not the person of Christ that
   is firstly and properly intended by that name in the gospel, is a lewd
   and impious imagination; and we may as well make Christ to be only a
   light within us, as to be the doctrine of the gospel without us. This
   knowledge of Jesus Christ I aver to be the only fountain of all saving
   knowledge: which is farther reflected on by this author; and he adds
   (no doubt out of respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me), "that he will not envy the glory of
   this discovery to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its author;" and therefore honestly confesses<note n="confesseth">Auto-modernized</note> that
   he met with it in my book. But what does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he intend? Whither will
   prejudice and corrupt designs carry and transport the minds of men? Is
   it possible that he should be ignorant that it is the duty of all
   Christians to know Jesus Christ, to be acquainted with the person of
   Christ, and that this is the fountain of all saving knowledge, until he
   met with it in my book about communion with God; which I dare say he
   looked not into, but only to find what he might except against? It is
   the Holy Ghost himself that is the author of this discovery; and it is
   the great fundamental principle of the gospel. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, surely, this
   cannot be the man's intention; and therefore we must look a little
   farther, to see what it is that he aims<note n="aimeth">Auto-modernized</note> at. After, then, the
   repetition of some words of mine, he adds, as his sense upon them, p.
   39, "So that it seems the gospel of Christ makes a very imperfect and
   obscure discovery of the nature, attributes, and the will of God, and
   the methods of our recovery. We may thoroughly understand whatever is
   revealed in the gospel, and yet not have a clear and saving knowledge
   of these things, until we get a more intimate acquaintance with the
   person of Christ." And again, p. 40: "I shall show you what additions
   these men make to the gospel of Christ by an acquaintance with his
   person; and I confess I am very much beholden to this author, for
   acknowledging from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they fetch all their orthodox and gospel
   mysteries, for I had almost pored my eyes out with seeking for them in
   the gospel, but could never find them; but I learn now, that indeed
   they are not to be found there, unless we be first acquainted with the
   person of Christ." So far as I can gather up the sense of these loose
   expressions, it is, that I assert a knowledge of the person of Jesus
   Christ which is not revealed in the gospel, which is not taught us in
   the writings of Moses, the prophets, or apostles, but must be had some
   other way. He tells me afterward, p. 41, that I put in a word
   fallaciously, which expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the contrary; as though I intended
   another knowledge of Christ than what is declared in the gospel. Now,
   he either thought that this was not my design or intention, but would
   make use of a pretence of it for his advantage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> an end aimed at
   (which what it was I know well enough); or he thought, indeed, that I
   did assert and maintain such a knowledge of the person of Christ as was
   not received by Scripture revelation. If it was the first, we have an
   instance of that new morality which these new doctrines are accompanied
   withal; if the latter, he discovers how meet a person he is to treat of
   things of this nature. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, to prevent such scandalous
   miscarriages, or futilous imaginations for the future, I here tell him,
   that if he can find in that book, or any other of my writings, any
   expression, or word, or syllable, intimating any knowledge of Christ,
   or any acquaintance with the person of Christ, but what is revealed and
   declared in the gospel, in the writings of Moses, the prophets, and
   apostles, and as it is so revealed and declared, and learned from
   thence, I will publicly burn that book with my own hands, to give him
   and all the world satisfaction. Nay, I say more: if an angel from
   heaven pretend to give any other knowledge of the person of Christ, but
   what is revealed in the gospel, let him be accursed. And here I leave
   this author to consider with himself, what was the true occasion why he
   should first thus represent himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the world in print, by the
   avowing of so unworthy and notorious a calumny.
				</p><p>
   Whereas, therefore, by an acquaintance with the person of Christ, it is
   undeniably evident that I intended nothing but that knowledge of Christ
   which it is the duty of every Christian to labour after, -- no other
   but what is revealed, declared, and delivered in the Scripture, as
   almost every page of my book does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> manifest where I treat of these
   things; I do here again, with the good leave of this author, assert,
   that this knowledge of Christ is very necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christians, and
   the fountain of all saving knowledge whatever. And as he may, if he
   please, review the honesty and truth of that passage, p. 38, "So that
   our acquaintance with Christ's person, in this man's divinity,
   signifies such a knowledge of what Christ is, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done, and suffered
   for us, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> we may learn those greater, deeper, and more saving
   mysteries of the gospel, which Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not expressly revealed to
   us;" so I will not so far suspect the Christianity of them with whom we
   have to do, as to think it necessary to confirm by texts of Scripture
   either of these assertions; which whoever denies is an open apostate
   from the gospel.
				</p><p>
   Having laid this foundation in an equal mixture of that truth and
   sobriety with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> sundry late writings of this nature and to the same
   purpose have been stuffed, he proceeds to declare what desperate
   consequences ensue upon the necessity of that knowledge of Jesus Christ
   which I have asserted, addressing himself to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, p. 40.
				</p><p>
   Many instances of such dealings will make me apt to think that some
   men, whatever they pretend to the contrary, have but little knowledge
   of Jesus Christ indeed. But whatever this man thinks of him, an account
   must one day be given before and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him of such false calumnies as
   his lines are stuffed withal. Those who will believe him, that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   almost "pored out his eyes" in reading the gospel, with a design to
   find out mysteries that are not in it, are left by me to their liberty;
   only I cannot but say, that his way of expressing the study of the
   Scripture, is [not?] such as becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> a man of his wisdom, gravity, and
   principles. He will, I hope, one day be better acquainted with what
   belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the due investigation of sacred truth in the Scripture,
   than to suppose it represented by such childish expressions. What he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> learned from me I know not; but that I have anywhere taught that
   there are mysteries of religion that are not to be found in the gospel,
   unless we are first acquainted with the person of Christ, is a
   frontless and impudent falsehood. I own no other, never taught other
   knowledge of Christ, or acquaintance with his person, but what is
   revealed and declared in the gospel; and therefore, no mysteries of
   religion can be thence known and received, before we are acquainted
   with the gospel itself. Yet I will mind this author of that, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> if
   he be ignorant, he is unfit to be a teacher of others, and which if he
   deny, he is unworthy the name of a Christian, -- namely, that by the
   knowledge of the person of Christ, the great mystery of God manifest in
   the flesh, as revealed and declared in the gospel, we are led into a
   clear and full understanding of many other mysteries of grace and
   truth; which are all centred in his person, and without which we can
   have no true nor sound understanding of them. I shall speak it yet
   again, that this author, if it be possible, may understand it; or,
   however, that he and his co-partners in design may know that I neither
   am nor ever will be ashamed of it:  that without the knowledge of the
   person of Christ, which is our acquaintance with him (as we are
   commanded to acquaint ourselves with God) as he is the eternal Son of
   God incarnate, the mediator between God and man, with the mystery of
   the love, grace, and truth of God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, as revealed and declared in
   the Scripture, there is no true, useful, saving knowledge of any other
   mysteries or truths of the gospel to be attained. This being the
   substance of what is asserted in my discourse, I challenge this man, or
   any to whose pleasure and favour his endeavours in this kind are
   sacrificed, to assert and maintain the contrary, if so be they are
   indeed armed with such a confidence as to impugn the foundations of
   Christianity.
				</p><p>
   But to evince his intention, he transcribes<note n="transcribeth">Auto-modernized</note> the ensuing passages out
   of my discourse:  P. 41, "The sum of all true wisdom and knowledge may
   be reduced to these three heads:  1. The knowledge of God; his nature
   and properties. 2. The knowledge of ourselves with reference to the
   will of God concerning us. 3. Skill to walk in communion with God. In
   these three is summed up all true wisdom and knowledge, and not any of
   them is to any purpose to be obtained, or is manifested, but only in
   and by the Lord Christ."
				</p><p>
   This whole passage I am far from disliking, upon this representation of
   it, or any expression in it. Those who are not pleased with this
   distribution of spiritual wisdom, may make use of any such of their own
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> they are better satisfied. This of mine was sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   my purpose. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> this censure is passed by him:  "Where by is
   fallaciously added to include the revelations Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made; whereas
   his first undertaking was, to show how impossible it is to understand
   these things savingly and clearly, notwithstanding all those
   revelations God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of himself and his will by Moses and the
   prophets, and by Christ himself, without an acquaintance with his
   person." The fallacy pretended is merely of his own coining; my words
   are plain, and suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> my own purpose, and to declare my mind in
   what I intend; which he openly corrupting, or not at all understanding,
   frames an end never thought of by me, and then feigns fallacious means
   of attaining it. The knowledge I mean is to be learned by Christ;
   neither is any thing to be learned in him but what is learned by him. I
   do say, indeed, now, whatever I have said before, that it is impossible
   to understand any sacred truth savingly and clearly, without the
   knowledge of the person of Christ; and shall say so still, let this man
   and his companions say what they will to the contrary: but that in my
   so saying I exclude the consideration of the revelations which Christ
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made, or that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of himself by Moses and the prophets,
   and Christ himself, the principal of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> concern his person, and
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> alone we come to know him, is an assertion becoming the modesty
   and ingenuity of this author. But upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> he proceeds, and says, that as
   to the first head he will take notice of those peculiar discoveries of
   the nature of God of which the world was ignorant before, and of which
   revelation is wholly silent, but are now clearly and savingly learned
   from an acquaintance with Christ's person. But what, in the meantime,
   is become of modesty, truth, and honesty? Do men reckon that there is
   no account to be given of such falsifications? Is there any one word or
   tittle in my discourse of any such knowledge of the nature or
   properties of God as of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> revelation is wholly silent? What does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   this man intend? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he either not at all understand what I say; or
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he not care what he says himself? What have I done to him? in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   have I injured him? how have I provoked him, that he should sacrifice
   his conscience and reputation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> such a revenge? Must he yet hear it
   again? I never thought, I never owned, I never wrote, that there was
   any acquaintance to be obtained with any property of the nature of God
   by the knowledge of the person of Christ, but what is taught and
   revealed in the gospel; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> alone all knowledge of Christ, his
   person, and his doctrine, is to be learned. And yet I will say again,
   if we learn not thence to know the Lord Christ, -- that is, his person,
   -- we shall never know any thing of God, ourselves, or our duty,
   clearly and savingly (I use the words again, notwithstanding the
   reflections on them, as more proper in this matter than any used by our
   author in his eloquent discourse), and as we ought to do. From hence he
   proceeds to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> weak and confused discourses about the knowledge of God
   and his properties without any knowledge of Christ; for he not only
   tells us "what reason we had to believe such and such things of God, if
   Christ had never appeared in the world," (take care, I pray, that we be
   thought as little beholden to him as may be), "but that God's readiness
   to pardon, and the like, are plainly revealed in the Scripture, without
   any farther acquaintance with the person of Christ," p. 43. What this
   farther acquaintance with the person of Christ should mean, I do not
   well understand: it may be, any more acquaintance with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   some that is necessary; -- it may be, without any more ado as to an
   acquaintance with him. And if this be his intention, -- as it must be,
   if there be sense in his words, -- that God's readiness to pardon
   sinners is revealed in the Scripture without respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of
   Jesus Christ, it is a piece of dull Socinianism; which, because I have
   sufficiently confuted else where, I shall not here farther discover the
   folly of. [As] for a knowledge of God's essential properties by the
   light of nature, it was never denied by me; yea, I have written and
   contended for it in another way than can be impeached by such trifling
   declamations. But yet, with his good leave, I do believe that there is
   no saving knowledge of, or acquaintance with God or his properties, to
   be attained, but in and through Jesus Christ, as revealed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in
   the gospel. And this I can confirm with testimonies of the Scripture,
   fathers, schoolmen, and divines of all sorts, with reasons and
   arguments, such as I know this author cannot answer. And whatever great
   apprehensions he may have of his skill and abilities to know God and
   his properties by the light of nature, now that he neither knows nor is
   able to distinguish what he learns from thence, and what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   imbibed in his education from an emanation of divine revelation; yet I
   believe there were as wise men as himself amongst those ancient
   philosophers, concerning whom and their inquiries into the nature of
   God our apostle pronounces those censures, Rom. i.; 1 Cor. i.
				</p><p>
   But on this goodly foundation he proceeds to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a particular inference,
   p. 44, saying, "And is not this a confident man, to tell us that the
   love of God to sinners, and his pardoning mercy, could never have
   entered into the heart of man but by Christ, when the experience of the
   whole world confutes him? For, whatever becomes of his new theories,
   both Jews and heathens, who understood nothing at all of what Christ
   was to do in order to our recovery, did believe God to be gracious and
   merciful to sinners, and had reason to do so; because God himself had
   assured the Jews that he was a gracious and merciful God, pardoning
   iniquity, transgressions, and sins. And those natural notions heathens
   had of God, and all those discoveries God had made of himself in the
   works of creation and providence, did assure them that God is very
   good: and it is not possible to understand what goodness is, without
   pardoning grace."
				</p><p>
   I beg his excuse: truth and good company will give a modest man a
   little confidence sometimes; and against his experience of the whole
   world, falsely pretended, I can oppose the testimonies of the
   Scripture, and all the ancient writers of the church, very few
   excepted. We can know of God only what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, one way or other,
   revealed of himself, and nothing else; and I say again, that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   not revealed his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sinners, and his pardoning mercy, any other
   way but in and by Jesus Christ. For what he adds as to the knowledge
   which the Jews had of these things by God's revelation in the
   Scripture, when he can prove that all those revelations, or any of
   them, had not respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the promised seed, -- the Son of God, -- to
   be exhibited in the flesh to destroy the works of the devil, he will
   speak somewhat to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his purpose. In the meantime, this insertion of the
   consideration of them who enjoyed that revelation of Christ which God
   was pleased to build his church upon under the Old Testament, is weak
   and impertinent. Their apprehensions, I acknowledge, concerning the
   person of Christ, and the speciality of the work of his mediation, were
   dark and obscure; but so, also, proportionally was their knowledge of
   all other sacred truths, which yet with all diligence they inquired
   into. That which I intended is expressed by the apostle, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.9-1Cor.2.10">1 Corinthians 2:9-10</reference>, "It is written, Eye has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> prepared for
   them that love him. But God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> revealed them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by his Spirit."
   What a confident man was this apostle, as to affirm that the things of
   the grace and mercy of God did never enter into the heart of man to
   conceive, nor would so have done, had they not been revealed by the
   Spirit of God in the gospel through Jesus Christ!
				</p><p>
   But this is only a transient charge. There ensues that which is much
   more severe, p. 45; as, for instance, "He tells us, that in Christ'
   (that is, in his death and sufferings for our sins) God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested
   the naturalness of this righteousness' (that is, vindictive justice in
   punishing sin), that it was impossible that it should be diverted from
   sinners without the interposing of a propitiation; that is, that God is
   so just and righteous, that he cannot pardon sin without satisfaction
   to his justice.' Now, this indeed is such a notion of justice as is
   perfectly new, which neither Scripture nor nature acquaints us with;
   for all mankind have accounted it an act of goodness, without the least
   suspicion of injustice in it, to remit injuries and offences without
   exacting any punishment, -- that he is so far from being just, that he
   is cruel and savage, who will remit no offence till he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> satisfied
   his revenge." The reader who is in any measure or degree acquainted
   with these things, knows full well what is intended by that which I
   have asserted. It is no more but this, -- that such is the essential
   holiness and righteousness of the nature of God, that, considering him
   as the supreme governor and ruler of all mankind, it was inconsistent
   with the holiness and rectitude of his rule, and the glory of his
   government, to pass by sin absolutely, or to pardon it without
   satisfaction, propitiation, or atonement. This, I said, was made
   evident in the death and sufferings of Christ, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God made all our
   iniquities to meet upon him, and spared him not, that we might obtain
   mercy and grace. This is here now called out by our author as a very
   dangerous or foolish passage in my discourse, which he thought he might
   highly advantage his reputation by reflecting upon. But as the orator
   said to his adversary, "Equidem vehementer laetor eum esse me, in quem
   tu cum cuperes, nullam contumeliam jacere potueris, quae non ad maximam
   partem civium convenerit," -- so it is here fallen out. If this man
   knows not that this is the judgment of the generality of the most
   learned divines of Europe upon the matter, of all who have engaged with
   any success against the Socinians, one or two only excepted, I can pity
   him, but not relieve him in his unhappiness, unless he will be pleased
   to take more pains in reading good books than as yet he appears<note n="appeareth">Auto-modernized</note> to
   have done. But for the thing itself, and his reflections upon it, I
   shall observe yet some few things, and so pass on; -- as first, the
   opposition that he makes to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> my position is nothing but a crude
   assertion of one of the meanest and most absurd sophisms which the
   Socinians use in this cause, -- namely, that everyone may remit
   injuries and offences as he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>, without exacting any punishment:
   which, as it is true in most cases of injuries and offences against
   private persons, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> no others are concerned but themselves, nor
   are they obliged by any law of the community to pursue their own right;
   so, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> public rulers of the community, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> such
   injuries and offences as are done against supreme rule, tending
   directly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the dissolution of the society centring in it, to suppose
   that such rulers are not obliged to inflict those punishments which
   justice and the preservation of the community does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> require, is a fond
   and ridiculous imagination, -- destructive, if pursued, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all human
   society, and rendering government a useless thing in the world.
   Therefore, what this author (who seems to understand very little of
   these things) adds, "that governors may spare or punish as they see
   reason for it;" if the rule of that reason and judgment be not that
   justice which respects the good and benefit of the society or
   community, they do amiss, and sin, in sparing and punishing: which I
   suppose he will not ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the government of God. But I have
   fully debated these things in sundry writings against the Socinians; so
   that I will not again enlarge upon them without a more important
   occasion. It is not improbable but he knows where to find those
   discourses; and he may, when he please, exercise his skill upon them.
   Again: I cannot but remark upon the consequences that he charges<note n="chargeth">Auto-modernized</note> this
   position withal; and yet I cannot do it without begging pardon for
   repeating such horrid and desperate blasphemies. P. 46, "The account,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "of this is very plain; because the justice of God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   glutted itself with revenge on sin in the death of Christ, and so
   henceforward we may be sure he will be very kind, as a revengeful man
   is when his passion is over." P. 47, "The sum of which is, that God is
   all love and patience when he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taken his fill of revenge; as others
   use to say that the devil is very good when he is pleased." P. 59, "The
   justice and vengeance of God, having their actings assigned them to the
   full, being glutted and satiated with the blood of Christ, God may,"
   etc. I desire the reader to remember that the supposition whereon all
   these inferences are built, is only that of the necessity of the
   satisfaction of Christ with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the holiness and righteousness
   of God as the author of the law, and the supreme governor of mankind.
   And is this language becoming a son of the church of England? Might it
   not be more justly expected from a Jew or a Mohammedan, -- from
   Servetus or Socinus, from whom it is borrowed, -- than from a son of
   this church, in a book published by licence and authority? But it is to
   no purpose to complain: those who are pleased with these things, let
   them be so. But what if, after all, these impious, blasphemous
   consequences do follow as much upon this author's opinion as upon mine,
   and that with a greater show of probability? and what if, forgetting
   himself, within a few leaves he says the very same thing that I do, and
   casts himself under his own severest condemnation?
				</p><p>
   For the first: I presume he owns the satisfaction of Christ, and I will
   suppose it until he directly denies it; therefore, also, he owns and
   grants that God would not pardon any sin, but upon a supposition of a
   previous satisfaction made by Jesus Christ. Here, then, lies all the
   difference between us; -- that I say God could not, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his holiness and justice, as the author of the law and governor of the
   world, pardon sin absolutely without satisfaction: he says, that
   although he might have done so without the least diminution of his
   glory, yet he would not, but would have his Son by his death and
   suffering to make satisfaction for sin. I leave it now, not only to
   every learned and impartial reader, but to every man in his wits who
   understands common sense, whether the blasphemous consequences, which I
   will not again defile ink and paper with the expression of, do not seem
   to follow more directly upon his opinion than mine. For whereas I say
   not that God requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> any thing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the exercise of grace and mercy,
   but what he grants that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so also; -- only I say he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it
   because requisite to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his justice; he, because he chose it by a free
   act of his will and wisdom, when he might have done otherwise, without
   the least disadvantage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his righteousness or rule, or the least
   impeachment to the glory of his holiness. The odious blasphemies
   mentioned do apparently seem to make a nearer approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   assertion than to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mine. I cannot proceed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a farther declaration
   of it, because I abhor the rehearsal of such horrid profaneness. The
   truth is, they follow not in the least (if there be any thing in them
   but odious satanical exprobrations of the truth of the satisfaction of
   Christ) on either opinion; though I say this author knows not well how
   to discharge himself of them.
				</p><p>
   But what if he be all this while only roving in his discourse about the
   things that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no due comprehension of, merely out of a
   transporting desire to gratify himself and others, in traducing and
   making exceptions against my writings? What if, when he comes a little
   to himself, and expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the notions that have been instilled into
   him, he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> expressly as much as I do, or have done in any place of
   my writings? It is plain he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so, p. 49, in these words:  "As for
   sin, the gospel assures us that God is an irreconcilable enemy to all
   wickedness, it being so contrary to his own most holy nature, that if
   he have any love for himself, and any esteem for his own perfections
   and works, he must hate sin, which is so unlike himself, and which
   destroys the beauty and perfection of his workmanship. For this end he
   sent his Son into the world to destroy the works of the devil," etc.
   Here is the substance of what at any time on this subject I have
   pleaded for:  "God is an irreconcilable enemy to all wickedness," --
   that it "is contrary to his holy nature, so that he must hate it; and
   therefore sends his Son," etc. If sin be contrary to God's holy nature,
   -- if he must hate it, unless he will not love himself, nor value his
   own perfections, and therefore sent his Son to make satisfaction, we
   are absolutely agreed in this matter, and our author has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> lost "operam
   et oleum" in his attempt. But for the matter itself, if he be able to
   come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any consistency in his thoughts, or to know what is his own
   mind in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, I do hereby acquaint him that I have written one entire
   discourse [365] on that subject, and have lately reinforced the same
   argument in my Exercitations on the Epistle to the Hebrews, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> my
   judgment on this point is declared and maintained. Let him attempt an
   answer, if he please, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, or do it if he can. What he farther
   discourses<note n="discourseth">Auto-modernized</note> on this subject, pp. 46, 47, consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> only in odious
   representations and vile reflections on the principal doctrines of the
   gospel, not to be mentioned without offence and horror. But as to me,
   he proceeds to except, after his scoffing manner, against another
   passage, pp. 47, 48, -- "But, however, sinners have great reasons to
   rejoice in it, when they consider the nature and end of God's patience
   and forbearance towards them, -- viz., That it is God's taking a
   course, in his infinite wisdom and goodness, that we should not be
   destroyed notwithstanding our sins; that as before, the least sin could
   not escape without punishment, justice being so natural to God that he
   cannot forgive without punishing; so the justice of God being now
   satisfied by the death of Christ, the greatest sins can do us no hurt,
   but we shall escape with a notwithstanding our sins.' This, it seems,
   we learn from an acquaintance with Christ's person, though his gospel
   instructs us otherwise, that without holiness no man shall see God.'?"
   But he is here again at a loss, and understands not what he is about.
   That of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he was discoursing is the necessity of the satisfaction of
   Christ, and that must be it which he makes<note n="maketh">Auto-modernized</note> his inference from, but the
   passage he insists on, he lays down as expressive of the end of God's
   patience and forbearance towards sinners, which here is of no place nor
   consideration. But so it falls out, that he is seldom at any agreement
   with himself in any parts of his discourse; the reason of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> I do
   somewhat more than guess at. However, for the passage which he cites
   out of my discourse, I like it so well, as that I shall not trouble
   myself to inquire whether it be there or no, or on what occasion it is
   introduced. The words are, -- "That God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, in his justice, wisdom,
   and goodness, taken a course that we should not be destroyed,
   notwithstanding our sins" (that is, to save sinners); "for he that
   believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note>, although he be a sinner, shall be saved; and he that
   believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> not shall be damned," as one has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> assured us, whom I desire
   to believe and trust to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. If this be not so, what will become of this
   man and myself, with all our writings? for I know that we are both
   sinners; and if God will not save us, or deliver us from destruction,
   notwithstanding our sins, -- that is, pardon them through the
   bloodshedding of Jesus Christ, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we have redemption, even the
   forgiveness of sins, -- it had been better for us that we had never
   been born. And I do yet again say, that God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not, that he will not,
   pardon the least sin, without respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the satisfaction of Christ,
   according as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.18-2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</reference>; and the expression
   which must be set on the other side, on the supposition of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the
   greatest sin can do us no harm, is this man's addition, which his usual
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> truth has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> produced. But, withal, I never said, I never
   wrote, that the only supposition of the satisfaction of Christ is
   sufficient of itself to free us from destruction by sin.
				</p><p>
   There is, moreover, required on our part, faith and repentance; without
   which we can have no advantage by it, or interest in it. But he seems
   to understand by that expression, "notwithstanding our sins," though we
   should live and die in our sins without faith, repentance, or new
   obedience; for he supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> it sufficient to manifest the folly of this
   assertion, to mention that declaration of the mind of Christ in the
   gospel, that "without holiness no man shall see God." I wonder whether
   he thinks that those who believe the satisfaction of Christ, and the
   necessity of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God "made him to be sin who knew no sin,
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him," do believe that
   the personal holiness of men is [not] indispensably necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   pleasing and enjoyment of God. If he suppose that the satisfaction of
   Christ and the necessity of our personal holiness are really
   inconsistent, he must be treated in another manner: if he suppose that
   although they are consistent, yet those whom he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note> do so trust to
   the satisfaction of Christ, as to judge that faith, repentance, and
   holiness, are not indispensably necessary to salvation, he manifests
   how well skilled he is in their principles and practices. I have always
   looked on it as a piece of the highest disingenuity among the Quakers,
   that when any one pleads for the satisfaction of Christ or the
   imputation of his righteousness, they will clamorously cry out, and
   hear nothing to the contrary, "Yea, you are for the saving of polluted,
   defiled sinners; let men live in their sins and be all foul within, it
   is no matter, so long as they have a righteousness and a Christ without
   them." I have, I say, always looked upon it as a most disingenuous
   procedure in them, seeing no one is catechised amongst us, who knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note>
   not that we press a necessity of sanctification and holiness, equal
   with that of justification and righteousness. And yet this very course
   is here steered by this author, contrary to the constant declaration of
   the judgments of them with whom he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to do, -- contrary to the
   common evidence of their writings, preaching, praying, disputing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   another purpose; and that without relieving or countenancing himself by
   any one word or expression used or uttered by them. He charges<note n="chargeth">Auto-modernized</note> [them]
   as though they made holiness a very indifferent thing, and such as it
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not much concern any man whether he have an interest in or no; and
   I know not whether is more marvellous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me, that some men can so far
   concoct all principles of conscience and modesty as to publish such
   slanderous untruths, or that others can take contentment and
   satisfaction in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, who cannot but understand their disingenuity and
   falsehood.
				</p><p>
   His proceed in the same page is to except against that revelation of
   the wisdom of God which I affirm to have been made in the person and
   sufferings of Christ, which I thought I might have asserted without
   offence. But this man will have it, that "there is no wisdom in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>,
   if justice be so natural to God, that nothing could satisfy him but the
   death of his own Son." That any thing else could satisfy divine justice
   but the sufferings and death of the Son of God, so far as I know, he is
   the first that found out or discovered, if he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> yet found it out.
   Some have imagined that God will pardon sin, and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so, without any
   satisfaction at all; and some have thought that other ways of the
   reparation of lost mankind were possible, without this satisfaction of
   divine justice, which yet God in his wisdom determined on; but that
   satisfaction could be any otherwise made to divine justice, but by the
   death of the Son of God incarnate, none have used to say who know what
   they say in these things. "But wisdom," he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "consists in the
   choice of the best and fittest means to attain an end, when there were
   more ways than one of doing it; but it requires no great wisdom to
   choose when there is but one possible way." Yea, this it is to measure
   God, -- things infinite and divine, by ourselves. Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this man think
   that God's ends, as ours, have an existence in themselves out of him,
   antecedent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any acts of his divine wisdom? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he imagine that he
   balances<note n="balanceth">Auto-modernized</note> probable means for the attaining of an end, choosing some and
   rejecting others? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he surmise that the acts of divine wisdom with
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end and means are so really distinct, as the one to
   have a priority in time before the others? Alas, that men should have
   the confidence to publish such slight and crude imaginations! Again:
   the Scripture, which so often expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the incarnation of the Son of
   God, and the whole work of his mediation upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, as the effect of the
   infinite wisdom of God, -- as that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the stores, riches, and
   treasures of it are laid forth, -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> nowhere so speak of it in
   comparison with other means not so suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same end, but
   absolutely, and as it is in its own nature; unless it be when it is
   compared with those typical institutions which, being appointed to
   resemble it, some did rest in. And lastly, whereas there was but this
   one way for the redemption of mankind, and the restoration of the
   honour of God's justice and holiness, as he is the supreme lawgiver and
   governor of the universe; and whereas this one way was not in the least
   pervious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any created understanding, angelical or human, nor could
   the least of its concerns have ever entered into the hearts of any
   (nor, it may be, shall they ever know or be able to find it out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   perfection, but it will be left the object of their admiration to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   eternity); -- if this author can see no wisdom, or no great wisdom, in
   the finding out and appointing of this way, who can help it? I wish he
   would more diligently attend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their teachings who are able to
   instruct him better; and from whom, as having no prejudice against
   them, he may be willing to learn.
				</p><p>
   But this is the least part of what this worthy censurer of theological
   discourses rebukes and corrects. For whereas I had said, that we "might
   learn our disability to answer the mind and will of God in all or any
   part of the obedience he requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>," -- that is, without Christ or out
   of him; he adds, "That is, that it is impossible for us to do any thing
   that is good, but we must be acted, like machines, by an external
   force, -- by the irresistible power of the grace and Spirit of God.
   This, I am sure, is a new discovery; we learn no such thing from the
   gospel, and I do not see how he proves it from an acquaintance with
   Christ." But if he intends what he speaks, "we can do no good, but must
   be acted, like machines, by an external force," and charges<note n="chargeth">Auto-modernized</note> this on
   me, it is a false accusation, proceeding from malice or ignorance, or a
   mixture of both. If he intend, that we can of ourselves do any thing
   that is spiritually good and acceptable before God, without the
   efficacious work of the Spirit and grace of God in us, which I only
   deny, he is a Pelagian, and stands anathematised by many councils of
   the ancient church. And [as] for what is my judgment about the
   impotency that is in us by nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any spiritual good, -- the
   necessity of the effectual operation of the Spirit of God in and to our
   conversion, with his aids and assistance of actual grace in our whole
   course of obedience, which is no other but that of the ancient church,
   the most learned fathers, and the church of England itself in former
   days, -- I have now sufficiently declared and confirmed it in another
   discourse; whither this author is remitted, either to learn to speak
   honestly of what he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note>, or to understand it better, or answer it
   if he can.
				</p><p>
   He adds, "But still there is a more glorious discovery than this
   behind; and that is, the glorious end to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> sin is appointed and
   ordained (I suppose he means by God) is discovered in Christ, --
   namely, for the demonstration of God's vindictive justice, in measuring
   out to it a meet recompense of reward, and for the praise of God's
   glorious grace in the pardon and forgiveness of it; -- that is, that it
   could not be known how just and severe God is, but by punishing sin,
   nor how good and gracious God is, but by pardoning of it; and,
   therefore, lest his justice and mercy should never be known to the
   world, he appoints and ordains sin to this end, -- that is, decrees
   that men shall sin that he may make some of them the vessels of his
   wrath, and the examples of his fierce vengeance and displeasure, and
   others the vessels of his mercy, to the praise and glory of his free
   grace in Christ. This, indeed, is such a discovery as nature and
   revelation could not make," p. 51; which, in the next page, he calls
   God's "truckling and bartering with sin and the devil for his glory."
				</p><p>
   Although there is nothing in the words here reported as mine which is
   not capable of a fair defence, seeing it is expressly affirmed that
   "God set forth his Son to be a propitiation to declare his
   righteousness," yet I know not how it came to pass that I had a mind to
   turn to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the passage itself in my discourse, which I had not done
   before on any occasion, as not supposing that he would falsify my
   words, with whom it was so easy to pervert my meaning at any time, and
   to reproach what he could not confute. But, that I may give a specimen
   of this man's honesty and ingenuity, I shall transcribe the passage
   which he excepts against, because I confess it gave me some surprisal
   upon its first perusal. My words are these: "There is a glorious end
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> sin is appointed and ordained discovered in Christ, that
   others are unacquainted withal. Sin, in its own nature, tends merely to
   the dishonour of God, the debasement of his majesty, and the ruin of
   the creature in whom it is. Hell itself is but the filling of wretched
   creatures with the fruit of their own devices. The comminations and
   threats of God in the law do manifest one other end of it, -- even the
   demonstration of the vindicative justice of God in measuring out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it a meet recompense of reward. But here the law stays, and with it all
   other light, and discovers no other use or end of it at all. In the
   Lord Jesus Christ there is the manifestation of another and more
   glorious end, to wit, the praise of God's glorious grace in the pardon
   and forgiveness of it; -- God having taken order in Christ, that that
   thing which tended merely to his dishonour should be managed to his
   infinite glory, and that which of all things he desired to exalt, --
   even that he may be known and believed to be a God pardoning iniquity,
   transgressions, and sin." Such was my ignorance, that I did not think
   that any Christian, unless he were a professed Socinian, would ever
   have made exceptions against any thing in this discourse; the whole of
   it being openly proclaimed in the gospel, and confirmed in the
   particulars by sundry texts of Scripture, quoted in the margin of my
   book, which this man took no notice of. For the advantage he would make
   from the expression about the end to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> sin is appointed and
   ordained, it is childish and ridiculous; for every one who is not
   wilfully blind must see, that, by "ordained," I intended, not any
   ordination as to the futurition of sin, but to the disposal of sin to
   its proper end being committed, or to ordain it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its end upon a
   supposition of its being; which quite spoils this author's ensuing
   harangue. But my judgment in this matter is better expressed by another
   than I am able to do it myself, and, therefore, in his words I shall
   represent it. It is Augustine: says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "Saluberrime confitemur quod
   rectissime credimus, Deum Dominumque rerum omnium qui creavit omnia
   bona valde, et mala ex bonis exortura esse praescivit, et scivit magis
   ad suam omnipotentissimam bonitatem pertinere, etiam de malis
   benefacere, quam mala esse non sinere; sic ordinasse angelorum et
   hominum vitam, ut in ea prius ostenderet quid posset eorum liberum
   arbitrium, deinde quid posset suae gratiae beneficium, justitiaeque
   judicium."
				</p><p>
   This, our author would have to be God's "bartering with sin and the
   devil for his glory;" the bold impiety of which expression, among many
   others, for whose necessary repetition I crave pardon, manifests with
   what frame of spirit, with what reverence of God himself and all holy
   things, this discourse is managed.
				</p><p>
   But it seems I add, that "the demonstration of God's justice in
   measuring out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sin a meet recompense of reward is discovered in
   Christ, as this author says." Let him read again, "The comminations and
   threatenings of God in the law," etc. If this man were acquainted with
   Christ, he could not but learn somewhat more of truth and modesty,
   unless he be wilfully stupid. But what is the crime of this paragraph?
   That which it teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> is, that sin, in its own nature, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no end but
   the dishonour of God and the eternal ruin of the sinner; that, by the
   sentence and curse of the law, God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested that he will glorify
   his justice in the punishing of it; as also, that, in and through Jesus
   Christ, he will glorify grace and mercy in its pardon, on the terms of
   the gospel. What would he be at? If he have a mind to quarrel with the
   Bible, and to conflict the fundamental principles of Christianity, to
   what purpose does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he cavil at my obscure discourses, when the proper
   object of his displeasure lies plainly before him?
				</p><p>
   Let us proceed yet a little farther with our author, although I confess
   myself to be already utterly wearied with the perusal of such vain and
   frivolous imaginations. Yet thus he goes on, p. 53, "Thus much for the
   knowledge of ourselves with respect to sin, which is hid only in the
   Lord Christ. But then we learn what our righteousness is, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> we
   must appear before God, from an acquaintance with Christ. We have
   already learned how unable we are to make atonement for our sins,
   without which they can never be forgiven, and how unable we are to do
   any thing that is good; -- and yet nothing can deliver us from the
   justice and wrath of God, but a full satisfaction for our sins; and
   nothing can give us a title to a reward, but a perfect and unsinning
   righteousness. What should we do in this case? How shall we escape
   hell, or get to heaven, when we can neither expiate for our past sins,
   nor do any good for the time to come? Why, here we are relieved again
   by an acquaintance with Christ. His death expiates former iniquities,
   and removes the whole guilt of sin. But this is not enough, that we are
   not guilty, we must also be actually righteous; not only all sin is to
   be answered for, but all righteousness is to be fulfilled. Now, this
   righteousness we find only in Christ; we are reconciled to God by his
   death, and saved by his life. That actual obedience he yielded to the
   whole law of God, is that righteousness through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are saved; we are
   innocent by virtue of his sacrifice and expiation, and righteous with
   his righteousness."
				</p><p>
   What is here interposed, -- that we cannot do any good for the time to
   come, -- must be interpreted of ourselves, without the aid or
   assistance of the grace of God. And the things here reported by this
   author, are so expressed and represented, to expose them to reproach
   and scorn, to have them esteemed not only false, but ridiculous. But
   whether he be in his wits or no, or what he intends, so to traduce and
   scoff at the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, I profess I know not.
   What is it he would deny? what is it he would assert? Are we able to
   make an atonement for our sins? Can we be forgiven without an
   atonement? Can we of ourselves do any good without the aid and
   assistance of grace? Can any thing we do be a full satisfaction for our
   sins, or deliver us from the wrath of God; that is, the punishment due
   to our sins? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not the death of Christ expiate former iniquities,
   and remove the whole guilt of sin? Is the contrary to these things the
   doctrine of the church of England? Is this the religion which is
   authorized to be preached? and are these the opinions that are licensed
   to be published to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the world? But, as I observed before, these
   things are other men's concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> more than mine, and with them I
   leave them. But I have said, as he quotes the place, "that we are
   reconciled to God by the death of Christ, and saved by his life, that
   actual obedience which he yielded to the whole law of God." As the
   former part of these words are expressly the apostle's, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.10">Romans 5:10</reference>, and
   so produced by me; so the next words I add are these of the same
   apostle, "If so be we are found in him, not having on our own
   righteousness which is of the law, but the righteousness which is of
   God by faith;" which he may do well to consider, and answer when he
   can.
				</p><p>
   Once more, and I shall be beholden to this author for a little respite
   of severity, while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> he diverts to the magisterial reproof of some other
   persons. Thus, then, he proceeds, p. 55:  "The third part of our
   wisdom is, to walk with God: and to that is required agreement,
   acquaintance, a way, strength, boldness, and aiming at the same end;
   and all these, with the wisdom of them, are hid in Jesus Christ." So
   far are my words, to which he adds: "The sum of which, in short, is
   this:  that Christ having expiated our sins, and fulfilled all
   righteousness for us, though we have no personal righteousness of our
   own, but are as contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God as darkness is to light, and death to
   life, and a universal pollution and defilement to a universal and
   glorious holiness, and hatred to love; yet the righteousness of Christ
   is a sufficient, nay, the only foundation of our agreement, and, upon
   that, of our walking with God: though St John tells us, If we say that
   we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not
   the truth; but if we walk in the light, as God is in the light, we have
   fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
   cleanses<note n="cleanseth">Auto-modernized</note> us from all sin,' <reference osisRef="1John.1.6-1John.1.7">1 John 1:6-7</reference> And our only acquaintance
   with God and knowledge of him is hid in Christ, which his word and
   works could not discover, as you heard above. And he is the only way
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we must walk with God; and we receive all our strength from
   him; and he makes us bold and confident too, having removed the guilt
   of sin, so that now we may look justice in the face, and whet our knife
   at the counter door, all our debts being discharged by Christ, as these
   bold acquaintances and familiars of Christ use to speak. And in Christ
   we design the same end that God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, which is the advancement of his
   own glory; that is, I suppose, by trusting to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the expiation and
   righteousness of Christ for salvation, without doing any thing
   ourselves, we take care that God shall not be wronged of the glory of
   his free grace, by a competition of any merits and deserts of our own."
				</p><p>
   What the author affirms to be the sum of my discourse in that place,
   which, indeed, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not transcribe, is, as to his affirmation of it,
   as contrary to God as darkness is to light, or death to life, or
   falsehood to the truth; that is, it is flagitiously false. That there
   is any agreement with God, or walking with God, for any men who have no
   personal righteousness of their own, but are contrary to God, etc., I
   never thought, I never wrote, nor any thing that should give the least
   countenance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a suspicion to that purpose. The necessity of an
   habitual and actual personal, inherent righteousness, of sanctification
   and holiness, of gospel obedience, of fruitfulness in good works, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   all who intend to walk with God, or come to the enjoyment of him, I
   have asserted and proved, with other manner of arguments than this
   author is acquainted withal. The remainder of his discourse in this
   place is composed of immorality and profaneness. To the first I must
   refer his charge, that "our only acquaintance with God and knowledge of
   him is hid in Christ, which his word could not discover," as he again
   expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> it, pp. 98, 99, "But that the reverend doctor confessed the
   plain truth, that their religion is wholly owing to an acquaintance
   with the person of Christ, and could never have been clearly and
   savingly learned from his gospel had they not first grown acquainted
   with his person;" which is plainly false. I own no knowledge of God,
   nor of Christ, but what is revealed in the word, as was before
   declared. And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the other head belongs the most of what ensues; for
   what is the intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of those reproaches which are cast on my
   supposed assertions? Christ is the only way in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> or through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we must
   walk with God. Yes, so he says, "I am the way;" "There is no coming to
   God but by me;" he having consecrated for us in himself "a new and
   living way" of drawing nigh to God. We receive all our strength from
   him; yes, for he says, "Without me ye can do nothing." He makes us bold
   and confident also, having removed the guilt of sin. So the apostle
   tells us, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.19-Heb.10.22">Hebrews 10:19-22</reference> What then? what follows upon these plain,
   positive, divine assertions of the Scripture? Why, then "we may look
   justice in the face, and whet our knife at the counter door." Goodly
   son of the church of England! Not that I impute these profane scoffings
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church itself, -- which I shall never do until it be
   discovered that the rulers of it do give approbation to such
   abominations; but I would mind the man of his relation to that church,
   which, to my knowledge, teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> better learning and manners.
				</p><p>
   From p. 57 to the end of his second section, p. 75, he gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> us a
   scheme of religion, which, in his scoffing language, he says, "men
   learn from an acquaintance with the person of Christ; and affirms,
   "that there needs no more to expose it to scorn with considering men
   than his proposal of it;" which in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> he owns to be his design. I
   know not any peculiar concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of mine in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, until he comes
   towards the close of it; which I shall particularly consider. But the
   substance of the religion which he thus avowedly attempts to expose to
   scorn, is the doctrine of God's eternal election; -- of his infinite
   wisdom in sending his Son to declare his righteousness for the
   forgiveness of sins, or in satisfying his justice, that sin might be
   pardoned, to the praise of the glory of his grace; -- of the imputation
   of the righteousness of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that do believe; -- of a sense
   of sin, humiliation for it, looking to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ for life and salvation,
   as the Israelites looked up to the brazen serpent in the wilderness; --
   of going to Christ by faith for healing our natures and cleansing our
   sins; with some other doctrines of the same importance. These are the
   principles which, according to his ability, he sarcastically traduces<note n="traduceth">Auto-modernized</note>
   and endeavours<note n="endeavoureth">Auto-modernized</note> to reflect scorn upon, by the false representation of
   some of them, and debasing others with an intermixture of vile and
   profane expressions. It is not impossible but that some or other may
   judge it their duty to rebuke this horrible (and yet were it not for
   the ignorance and profaneness of some men's minds, every way
   contemptible) petulancy. For my part I have other things to do, and
   shall only add, that I know no other Christian state in the world
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> such discourses would be allowed to pass under the signature of
   public authority. Only I wish the author more modesty and sobriety than
   to attempt, or suppose he shall succeed, in exposing to scorn the
   avowed doctrine in general of the church in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he lives; and which
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in the parts of it been asserted and defended by the greatest and
   most learned prelates of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> in the foregoing ages, such as Jewell,
   Whitgift, Abbot, Morton, Usher, Hall, Davenant, Prideaux, etc., with
   the most learned persons of its communion, as Reynolds, Whitaker,
   Hooker, Sutcliffe, etc., and others innumerable; -- testified to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in
   the name of this church by the divines, sent by public authority to the
   synod of Dort; -- taught by the principal practical divines of this
   nation; and maintained by the most learned at the dignified clergy at
   this day. He is no doubt at liberty to dissent from the doctrine of the
   church, and of all the learned men of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; but for a young man to
   suppose that, with a few loose, idle words, he shall expose to scorn
   that doctrine which the persons mentioned, and others innumerable, have
   not only explained, confirmed, and defended, with pains indefatigable,
   all kind of learning and skill, ecclesiastical, philosophical, and
   theological, in books and volumes, which the Christian world as yet
   knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note>, peruses<note n="peruseth">Auto-modernized</note>, and prizes<note n="prizeth">Auto-modernized</note>, but also lived long in fervent prayers
   to God for the revelation of his mind and truth to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, and in the
   holy practice of obedience suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the doctrines they professed, --
   is somewhat remote from that Christian humility which he ought not only
   to exercise in himself, but to give an example of to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others. But if
   this be the fruit of despising the knowledge of the person of Christ,
   -- of the necessity of his satisfaction, of the imputation of his
   righteousness, of union to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person as our head, -- of a sense of
   the displeasure of God due to sin, -- of the spirit of bondage and
   adoption, -- of the corruption of nature, and our disability to do any
   thing that is spiritually good without the effectual aids of grace; --
   if these, I say, and the like issues of appearing pride and elation of
   mind, be the fruit and consequent of rejecting these principles of the
   doctrine of the gospel, it manifests that there is, and will be, a
   proportion between the errors of men's minds and the depravation of
   their affections. It were a most easy task to go over all the
   particulars mentioned by him, and to manifest how foully he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   prevaricated in their representation, -- how he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> cast contempt on
   some duties of religion indispensably necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> salvation; and
   brought in the very words of the Scripture, -- and that in the true
   proper sense and intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of them, according to the judgment of all
   Christians, ancient and modern (as that of looking to Christ, as the
   Israelites looked to the brazen serpent in the wilderness), -- to bear
   a share and part in his scorn and contempt: as also, to defend and
   vindicate, not his odious, disingenuous expressions, but what he
   invidiously designs<note n="designeth">Auto-modernized</note> to expose, beyond his ability to gainsay, or with
   any pretence of sober learning to reply to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. But I give it up into the
   hands of those who are more concerned in the chastisement of such
   imaginations. Only, I cannot but tell this author what I have learned
   by long observation, -- namely, that those who, in opposing others,
   make it their design to [publish] and place their confidence in false
   representations, and invidious expressions of their judgments and
   opinions, waiving a true stating of the things in difference, and
   weighing of the arguments with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> they are confirmed, -- whatever
   pretence they may make of confidence, and contempt of them with whom
   they have to do, yet this way of writing proceeds from a secret sense
   of their disability to maintain their own opinions, or to reply to the
   reasonings of their adversaries in a fair and lawful disputation; or
   from such depraved affections as are sufficient to deter any sober
   person from the least communication in those principles which are so
   pleaded for. And the same I must say of that kind of writing (which in
   some late authors fills up almost every page in their books) which,
   beyond a design to load the persons of men with reproaches and
   calumnies, consists only in the collecting of passages here and there,
   up and down, out of the writings of others; which, as cut off from the
   body of their discourses, and design of the places which they belong
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, may, with a little artifice, either of addition or detraction,
   with some false glosses, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we shall have an immediate instance,
   be represented weak, or untrue, or improper, or some way or other
   obnoxious to censure. When diligence, modesty, love of truth, sobriety,
   true use of learning, shall again visit the world in a more plentiful
   manner; though differences should continue amongst us, yet men will be
   enabled to manage them honestly, without contracting so much guilt on
   themselves, or giving such fearful offence and scandal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others. But
   I return.
				</p><p>
   That in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I am particularly concerned, is the close with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he
   winds up this candid, ingenious discourse, p. 74. He quotes my words,
   "That the soul consents to take Christ on his own terms, to save him in
   his own way; and says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, Lord, I would have had you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note> and salvation in my
   way, that it might have been partly of mine endeavours, and as it were
   by the works of the law' (that is, by obeying the laws of the gospel);
   but I am now willing to receive you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, and to be saved in your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> way,
   merely by grace' (that is, without doing any thing, without obeying
   you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>). The most contented spouse, certainly, that ever was in the
   world, to submit to such hard conditions as to be saved for nothing.
   But what a pretty compliment does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the soul make to Christ after all
   this, when she adds, And though I would have walked according to my own
   mind, yet now I wholly give up myself to be ruled by your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Spirit.'?"
				</p><p>
   If the reader will be at the pains to look on the discourse from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>
   these passages are taken, I shall desire no more of his favour but that
   he profess himself to be a Christian, and then let him freely pronounce
   whether he find any thing in it obnoxious to censure. Or, I desire that
   any man, who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not forfeited all reason and ingenuity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faction
   and party, if he differ from me, truly to state in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, and oppose
   what I have said with an answer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the testimonies with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> it is
   confirmed, referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in the margin of my discourse. But the way of
   this author's proceeding, if there be no plea to be made for it from
   his ignorance and unacquaintedness not only with the person of Christ,
   but with most of the other things he undertakes to write about, is
   altogether inexcusable. The way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> I have expressed the consent of
   the soul in the receiving of Jesus Christ, to be justified, sanctified,
   saved by him, I still avow, as suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the mind of the Holy Ghost,
   and the experience of them that really believe. And whereas I added,
   that before believing, the soul did seek for salvation by the works of
   the law, as it is natural to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all, and as the Holy Ghost affirms of
   some (whose words alone I used, and expressly quoted that place from
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> I took them, -- namely, <reference osisRef="Rom.9.31-Rom.9.32">Romans 9:31-32</reference>;) -- this man adds, as
   an exposition of that expression, "That is, by obeying the laws of the
   gospel." But he knew that these were the words of the apostle, or he
   did not; if he did not, nor would take notice of them so to be,
   although directed to the place from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they are taken, it is
   evident how meet he is to debate matters of this nature and
   concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>, and how far he is yet from being in danger to "pore out
   his eyes" in reading the Scripture, as he pretends. If he did know them
   to be his words, why does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he put such a sense upon them as, in his own
   apprehension, is derogatory to gospel obedience? Whatever he thought of
   beforehand, it is likely he will now say that it is my sense, and not
   the apostle's, which he intends. But how will he prove that I intended
   any other sense than that of the apostle? how should this appear? Let
   him, if he can, produce any word in my whole discourse intimating any
   other sense. Nay, it is evident that I had no other intention but only
   to refer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that place of the apostle, and the proper sense of it;
   which is to express the mind and actings of those who, being ignorant
   of the righteousness of God, go about to establish their own
   righteousness; as he farther explains himself, <reference osisRef="Rom.10.3-Rom.10.4">Romans 10:3-4</reference> That I
   could not intend obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the laws of the gospel is so evident,
   that nothing but abominable prejudice or ignorance could hinder any man
   from discerning it. For that faith which I expressed by the soul's
   consent to take Christ as a saviour and a ruler, is the very first act
   of obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the gospel: so that in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> or upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> to exclude
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the gospel, is to deny what I assert; which, under the
   favour of this author, I understand myself better than to do. And as to
   all other acts of obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the laws of the gospel, following and
   proceeding from sincere believing, it is openly evident that I could
   not understand them when I spake only of what was antecedent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
   And if this man knows not what transactions are in the minds of many
   before they do come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the acceptance of Christ on his own terms, or
   believe in him according to the tenor of the gospel, there is reason to
   pity the people that are committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his care and instruction, what
   regard soever ought to be had to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself. And his pitiful trifling in
   the exposition he adds of this passage, "To be saved without doing any
   thing, without obeying you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, and the law," does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> but increase the guilt
   of his prevarications; for the words immediately added in my discourse
   are, -- "And although I have walked according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mine own mind, yet
   now I wholly give up myself to be ruled by your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> Spirit;" which, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   understanding of all men who understand any thing in these matters,
   signify no less than an engagement to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the universal relinquishing<note n="relinquishment">Auto-modernized</note> of
   sin, and entire obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ in all things. "But this,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "is a pretty compliment that the soul makes to Christ after
   all." But why is this to be esteemed only a "pretty compliment?" It is
   spoken at the same time, and, as it were, with the same breath, there
   being in the discourse no period between this passage and that before;
   and why must it be esteemed quite of another nature, so that in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   soul should only compliment, and be real in what is before expressed?
   What if one should say, it was real only in this latter expression and
   engagement, that the former was only a "pretty compliment?" May it not,
   with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> my sense and intention (from any thing in my words,
   or that can be gathered from them, or any circumstances of the place),
   be spoken with as much regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> truth and honesty? What religion
   these men are of I know not. If it be such as teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> them these
   practices, and countenances<note n="countenanceth">Auto-modernized</note> them in them, I openly declare that I am
   not of it, nor would be so for all that this world can afford. I shall
   have done, when I have desired him to take notice, that I not only
   believe and maintain the necessity of obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the laws,
   precepts, commands, and institutions of the gospel, -- of universal
   holiness, the mortification of all sin, fruitfulness in good works, in
   all that intend or design salvation by Jesus Christ; but also have
   proved and confirmed my persuasion and assertions by better and more
   cogent arguments than any which, by his writings, he seems as yet to be
   acquainted withal. And unless he can prove that I have spoken or
   written any thing to the contrary, or he can disprove the arguments
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> I have confirmed it, I do here declare him a person altogether
   unfit to be dealt withal about things of this nature, his ignorance or
   malice being invincible; nor shall I, on any provocation, ever
   hereafter take notice of him until he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> mended his manners.
				</p><p>
   His third section, p. 76, consists of three parts:  First, "That some"
   (in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is apparent that I am chiefly, if not only, intended) "do
   found a religion upon a pretended acquaintance with Christ's person,
   without and besides the gospel;" to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note> his running
   title of "No acquaintance with Christ but by revelation." Secondly, A
   supposition of a scheme of religion drawn from the knowledge of
   Christ's person; to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note> another, which he judges<note n="judgeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   better. Thirdly, An essay to draw up the whole plot and design of
   Christianity, with the method of the recovery of sinners to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. In
   the first of these, I suppose that I am, if not solely, yet
   principally, intended; especially considering what he affirms, pp. 98,
   99, namely, that "I plainly confess our religion is wholly owing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   acquaintance with the person of Christ, and could never have been
   clearly and savingly learned from the gospel, had we not first grown
   acquainted with his person." Now, in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> there is a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> instance
   of that truth and honesty with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> my writings are entertained by this
   sort of men. It is true, I have asserted that it is necessary for
   Christians to know Jesus Christ, -- to be acquainted with his person
   that is (as I have fully and largely declared it in the discourse
   excepted against), the glory of his divine nature, the purity of his
   human, the infinite condescension of his person in the assumption of
   our nature, his love and grace, etc., as is at large there declared:
   and now I add, that he by whom this is denied is no Christian.
   Secondly, I have taught, that by this knowledge of the person of
   Christ, or an understanding of the great mystery of godliness, God
   manifested in the flesh, which we ought to pray for and labour after,
   we come more fully and clearly to understand sundry other important
   mysteries of heavenly truth; which without the knowledge of Christ we
   cannot attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. And how impertinent this man's exceptions are
   against this assertion, we have seen already. But, thirdly, that this
   knowledge of Christ, or acquaintance with him, is to be attained before
   we come to know the gospel, or by any other means than the gospel, or
   is any other but the declaration that is made of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> in and by the
   gospel, was never thought, spoken, or written by me, and is here
   falsely supposed by this author, as elsewhere falsely charged on me.
   And I again challenge him to produce any one letter or tittle out of
   any of my writings to give countenance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this frontless calumny. And
   therefore, although I do not like his expression, p. 77, "Whoever would
   understand the religion of our Saviour, must learn it from his
   doctrine, and not from his person," for many reasons I could give; yet
   I believe no less than he, that the efficacy of Christ's mediation
   depending on God's appointment can be known only by revelation, and
   that no man can draw any one conclusion from the person of Christ which
   the gospel has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not expressly taught; because we can know no more of
   its excellency, worth, and works, than what is there revealed: through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   he may see how miserably ill-will, malice, or ignorance has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> betrayed
   him into the futilous pains of writing this section upon a contrary
   supposition falsely imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me. And as for his drawing schemes of
   religion, I must tell him, and let him disprove it if he be able, I own
   no religion, no article of faith, but what is taught expressly in the
   Scripture, mostly confirmed by the ancient general councils of the
   primitive church, and the writings of the most learned fathers, against
   all sorts of heretics, especially the Gnostics, Photinians, and
   Pelagians, consonant to the articles of the church of England, and the
   doctrine of all the reformed churches of Europe. And if in the
   exposition of any place of Scripture I dissent from any that, for the
   substance of it, own the religion I do, I do it not without cogent
   reasons from the Scripture itself; and where, in any opinions which
   learned men have (and, it may be, always had) different apprehensions
   about, which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not been thought to prejudice the unity of faith
   amongst them, I hope I do endeavour to manage that dissent with that
   modesty and sobriety which becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> me. And as for the schemes, plots,
   or designs of religion or Christianity, given us by this author and
   owned by him (it being taken pretendedly from the person of Christ,
   when it is hoped that he may have a better to give us from the gospel,
   seeing he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> told us we must learn our religion from his doctrine and
   not from his person); besides that it is liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> innumerable
   exceptions in particular, which may easily be given in against it by
   such as have nothing else to do, whereas it makes no mention of the
   effectual grace of Christ and the gospel for the conversion and
   sanctification of sinners, and the necessity of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all acts of
   holy obedience, -- it is merely Pelagianism, and stands anathematised
   by sundry councils of the ancient church. I shall not, therefore,
   concern myself farther in any passages of this section, most of them
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it reflects on others standing in competition for truth and
   ingenuity with the foundation and design of the whole; only I shall
   say, that the passage of pp. 88, 89, -- "This made the divine goodness
   so restlessly zealous and concerned for the recovery of mankind;
   various ways he attempted in former ages, but with little success, as I
   observed before; but at last God sent his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
   into the world," -- without a very cautious explanation and charitable
   construction, is false, scandalous, and blasphemous. For allow this
   author, who contends so severely for propriety of expressions, against
   allusions and metaphors, to say that the divine goodness was
   "restlessly zealous and concerned" (for, indeed, such is our weakness,
   that, whether we will or no, we must sometimes learn and teach divine
   things in such words as are suited to convey an apprehension of them
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our minds, though, in their application to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine nature,
   they are incapable of being understood in the propriety of their
   signification, though this be as untowardly expressed as any thing I
   have of late met withal); yet what colour can be put upon, what excuse
   can be made for, this doctrine, that "God in former ages, by various
   ways, attempted the recovery of mankind, but with little success," I
   know not. Various attempts in God for any end without success, do not
   lead the mind into right notions of his infinite wisdom and
   omnipotence; and that God, by any way, at any time, attempted the
   recovery of mankind distinctly and separately from the sending of his
   Son, is lewdly false.
				</p><p>
   In the greatest part of his fourth section, entitled, "How men pervert
   the Scripture to make it comply with their fancy," I am not much
   concerned; save that the foundation of the whole, and that which
   animates his discourse from first to last, is laid in an impudent
   calumny, -- namely, that I declare that "our religion is wholly owing
   to an acquaintance with the person of Christ, and could never have been
   clearly and savingly learned from his gospel, had we not first grown
   acquainted with his person." This shameless falsehood is that alone
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he takes occasion and confidence, to reproach myself and others,
   to condemn the doctrine of all the reformed churches and openly to
   traduce and vilify the Scripture itself. I shall only briefly touch on
   some of the impotent dictates of this great corrector of divinity and
   religion. His discourse of accommodating Scripture expressions to men's
   own dreams, pp. 99-101, being such as any man may use concerning any
   other men on the like occasion, if they have a mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and intend
   to have no more regard to their consciences than some others seem to
   have, may be passed by. P. 102, he falls upon the ways of expounding
   Scripture among those whom he sets himself against, and positively
   affirms, "that there are two ways of it in great vogue among them: 
   First, By the sound and clink of the words and phrases; which, as he
   says, is all some men understand by keeping a form of sound words.
   Secondly, When this will not do, they reason about the sense of them
   from their own preconceived notions and opinions, and prove that this
   must be the meaning of Scripture, because otherwise it is not
   reconcilable to their dreams; which is called expounding Scripture by
   the analogy of faith."
				</p><p>
   Thus far he; and yet we shall have the same man not long hence pleading
   for the necessity of holiness. But I wish, for my part, he would take
   notice that I despise that holiness, and the principles of it, which
   will allow men to coin, invent, and publish such notorious untruths
   against any sort of men whatever. And whereas, by what immediately
   follows, I seem to be principally intended in this charge, as I know
   the untruth of it, so I have published some expositions on some parts
   of the Scripture to the judgment of the Christian world; to which I
   appeal from the censures of this man and his companions, as also for
   those which, if I live and God will, I shall yet publish; and do
   declare, that, for reasons very satisfactory to my mind, I will not
   come to him nor them to learn how to expound the Scripture.
				</p><p>
   But he will justify his charge by particular instances, telling us, p.
   102, "Thus when men are possessed with a fancy of an acquaintance with
   Christ's person, then to know Christ can signify nothing else but to
   know his person and all his personal excellencies, and beauties,
   fulness, and preciousness, etc. And when Christ is said to be made
   wisdom to us, this is a plain proof that we must learn all our
   spiritual wisdom from an acquaintance with his person; though some
   duller men can understand no more by it than the wisdom of those
   revelations Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of God's will to the world." I would beg
   of this man, that if he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the honour of Christian
   religion, or care of his own soul, he would be tender in this matter,
   and not reflect with his usual disdain upon the knowledge of the person
   of Christ. I must tell him again, what all Christians believe, -- Jesus
   Christ is Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God incarnate. The person of
   Christ is Christ himself, and nothing else; his personal excellencies
   are the properties of his person, as his two natures are united
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, and as he was thereby made meet to be the mediator between God
   and man. To know Christ in the language of the Scripture, [of] the
   whole church of God ancient and present, in common sense and
   understanding, is to know the person of Christ as revealed and declared
   in the gospel, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ends for which he is proposed and
   made known in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And this knowledge of him, as it is accompanied
   with, and cannot be without, the knowledge of his mind and will,
   declared in his precepts, promises, and institutions, is effectual to
   work and produce, in the souls of them who so know him, that faith in
   him, and obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, which he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> require. And what would this
   man have? He who is otherwise minded has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> renounced his Christianity,
   if ever he had any; and if he be thus persuaded, to what purpose is it
   to set up and combat the mormos and chimeras of his own imagination?
   Well, then, I do maintain, that to know Christ according to the gospel,
   is to know the person of Christ; for Christ and his person are the
   same. Would he now have me to prove this by testimonies or arguments,
   or the consent of the ancient church? I must beg his excuse at present;
   and so for the future, unless I have occasion to deal with Gnostics,
   Familists, or Quakers. And as for the latter clause, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Christ is
   said to be made wisdom to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, he says, "Some duller men can
   understand no more by it than the wisdom of those revelations Christ
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of God's will to the world," -- who are dull men indeed, and
   so let them pass.
				</p><p>
   His ensuing discourses, in pp. 103-105, contain the boldest reflections
   on, and openest derisions of, the expressions and way of teaching
   spiritual things warranted in and by the Scripture, that to my
   knowledge I ever read in a book licensed to be printed by public
   authority: as, in particular, the expressions of faith in Christ, by
   "coming to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him," and "receiving of him," -- which are the words of
   the Holy Ghost, and used by him in his wisdom to instruct us in the
   nature of this duty, -- are, amongst others, the subjects of his scorn.
   The first part of it, though I remember not to have given any occasion
   to be particularly concerned in it, I shall briefly consider. P. 103,
   "Thus when men have first learned, from an acquaintance with Christ, to
   place all their hopes of salvation in a personal union with Christ,
   from whom they receive the free communications of pardon and grace,
   righteousness and salvation, what more plain proof can any man who is
   resolved to believe this, desire of it, than <reference osisRef="1John.5.12">1 John 5:12</reference>, He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   the Son has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> life, and he that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not the Son has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not life?' And
   what can having the Son signify, but having an interest in him, being
   made one with him? though some will be so perverse as to understand it
   of believing, and having his gospel. But the phrase of having the Son,'
   confutes that dull and moral interpretation, especially when we
   remember it is called, being in Christ, and abiding in him;' which must
   signify a very near union between Christ's person and us."
				</p><p>
   I suppose that expression of "personal union" sprung out of design, and
   not out of ignorance; for, if I mistake not, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> somewhere in his
   book take notice that it is disclaimed, and only a union of believers
   with or to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ asserted; or, if it be his mistake,
   all comes to the same issue. Personal, or hypostatical union, is that
   of different natures in the same person, giving them the same singular
   subsistence. This none pretend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> with Jesus Christ. But it is the
   union of believers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ which is spiritual and
   mystical, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they are in him and he in them, and so are one with
   him, their head, as members of his mystical body, which is pleaded for
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, with the free communications of grace, righteousness, and
   salvation, in the several and distinct ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are capable to
   receive them from him, or be made partakers of them; [in this] we place
   all hopes of salvation. And we do judge, moreover, that he who is
   otherwise minded must betake himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another gospel; for he
   completely renounces<note n="renounceth">Auto-modernized</note> that in our Bibles. Is this our crime, -- that
   which we are thus charged with, and traduced for? Is the contrary
   to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> the doctrine that the present church of England approves<note n="approveth">Auto-modernized</note> and
   instructs her children in? Or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> any man think that we will be scared
   from our faith and hope by such weak and frivolous attempts against
   them? Yea, but it may be it is not so much the thing itself, as the
   miserable proof which we produce from the Scripture in the confirmation
   of it; for we do it from that of the apostle, <reference osisRef="1John.5.12">1 John 5:12</reference> If he think
   that we prove these things only by this testimony, he is mistaken at
   his wonted rate. Our faith in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is built upon innumerable express
   testimonies of the Scripture, -- indeed the whole revelation of the
   will of God and the way of salvation by Jesus Christ in the gospel.
   Those who prove it, also, from this text, have sufficient ground and
   reason for what they plead. And, notwithstanding the pleasant scoffing
   humour of this author, we yet say that it is perverse folly for any one
   to say that the having of the Son or Christ expressed in the text, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   intend either the having an interest in him and union with him, or the
   obeying of his gospel, exclusively to the other, -- these being
   inseparable, and included in the same expression. And as to what he
   adds about being in Christ, and abiding in him, -- which are the
   greatest privileges of believers, and that as expressed in words taught
   by the Holy Ghost, -- it is of the same strain of profaneness with much
   of what ensues; which I shall not farther inquire into.
				</p><p>
   I find not myself concerned in his ensuing talk, but only in one
   reflection on the words of the Scripture, and the repetition of his
   old, putid, and shameless calumny, p. 108, until we come to p. 126,
   where he arraigns an occasional discourse of mine about the necessity
   of holiness and good works; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> only filched out of the
   whole what he thought he could wrest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his end, and scoffingly
   descant upon. I shall, therefore, for once, transcribe the whole
   passage as it lies in my book, and refer it to the judgment of the
   reader, p. 206: [366] --
				</p><p>
   "2. The second objection is, That if the righteousness and obedience of
   Christ to the law be imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, then what need we yield obedience
   ourselves?' To this, also, I shall return answer as briefly as I can in
   the ensuing observations: 
				</p><p>
   "(1.) The placing of our gospel obedience on the right foot of account
   (that it may neither be exalted into a state, condition, use, or end,
   not given it of God; nor any reason, cause, motive, end, necessity of
   it, on the other hand, taken away, weakened, or impaired), is a matter
   of great importance. Some make our obedience, the works of faith, our
   works, the matter or cause of our justification; some, the condition of
   the imputation of the righteousness of Christ; some, the qualification
   of the person justified, on the one hand; some exclude all the
   necessity of them, and turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, on
   the other. To debate these differences is not my present business;
   only, I say, on this and other accounts, the right stating of our
   obedience is of great importance as to our walking with God.
				</p><p>
   "(2.) We do by no means assign the same place, condition, state, and
   use to the obedience of Christ imputed to us, and our obedience
   performed to God. If we did, they were really inconsistent. And
   therefore those who affirm that our obedience is the condition or cause
   of our justification, do all of them deny the imputation of the
   obedience of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. The righteousness of Christ is imputed to
   us, as that on the account of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are accepted and esteemed
   righteous before God, and are really so, though not inherently. We are
   as truly righteous with the obedience of Christ imputed to us as Adam
   was, or could have been, by a complete righteousness of his own
   performance. So <reference osisRef="Rom.5.18">Romans 5:18</reference>, by his obedience we are made righteous, --
   made so truly, and so accepted; as by the disobedience of Adam we are
   truly made trespassers, and so accounted. And this is that which the
   apostle desires to be found in, in opposition to his own righteousness,
   <reference osisRef="Phil.3.9">Philippians 3:9</reference> But our own obedience is not the righteousness whereupon
   we are accepted and justified before God; although it be acceptable to
   God that we should abound in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And this distinction the apostle
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> evidently deliver and confirm, so as nothing can be more clearly
   revealed: <reference osisRef="Eph.2.8-Eph.2.10">Ephesians 2:8-10</reference>, For by grace are ye saved through faith: and
   that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any
   man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> good works, which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> prepared that we should walk in them.'
   We are saved, or justified (for that it is of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle treats),
   by grace through faith,' which receives Jesus Christ and his obedience;
   not of works, lest any man should boast.' But what works are they that
   the apostle intends?' The works of believers, as in the very beginning
   of the next words is manifest: ?"For we are," we believers, with our
   obedience and our works, of whom I speak.' Yea; but what need, then, of
   works?' Need still there is: We are his workmanship,' etc.
				</p><p>
   "Two things the apostle intimates in these words: 
				</p><p>
   "[1.] A reason why we cannot be saved by works, -- namely, because we
   do them not in or by our own strength; which is necessary we should do,
   if we will be saved by them, or justified by them. But this is not so,'
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle; for we are the workmanship of God,' etc.; -- all our
   works are wrought in us, by full and effectual undeserved grace.
				</p><p>
   "[2.] An assertion of the necessity of good works, notwithstanding that
   we are not saved by them; and that is, that God has ordained that we
   shall walk in them: which is a sufficient ground of our obedience,
   whatever be the use of it.
				</p><p>
   "If you will say then, What are the true and proper gospel grounds,
   reasons, uses, and motives of our obedience; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> the necessity
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> may be demonstrated, and our souls be stirred up to abound and
   be fruitful in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>?' I say, they are so many, and lie so deep in the
   mystery of the gospel and dispensation of grace, spread themselves so
   throughout the whole revelation of the will of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, that to
   handle them fully and distinctly, and to give them their due weight, is
   a thing that I cannot engage in, lest I should be turned aside from
   what I principally intend. I shall only give you some brief heads of
   what might at large be insisted on: 
				</p><p>
   "1st. Our universal obedience and good works are indispensably
   necessary, from the sovereign appointment and will of God; Father, Son,
   and Holy Ghost.
				</p><p>
   "In general. This is the will of God, even your sanctification,' or
   holiness, <reference osisRef="1Thess.4.3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</reference> This is that which God wills, which he
   requires of us, -- that we be holy, that we be obedient, that we do his
   will as the angels do in heaven. The equity, necessity, profit, and
   advantage of this ground of our obedience might at large be insisted
   on; and, were there no more, this might suffice alone, -- if it be the
   will of God, it is our duty: 
				</p><p>
   "(1st.) The Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordained or appointed it. It is the will of the
   Father, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.10">Ephesians 2:10</reference> The Father is spoken of personally, Christ being
   mentioned as mediator.
				</p><p>
   "(2dly.) The Son has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordained and appointed it as mediator. <reference osisRef="John.15.16">John 15:16</reference>, ?"I have ordained you, that ye should bring forth fruit" of
   obedience, and that it should remain.' And, --
				</p><p>
   "(3dly.) The Holy Ghost appoints and ordains believers to works of
   obedience and holiness, and to work holiness in others. So, in
   particular, <reference osisRef="Acts.13.2">Acts 13:2</reference>, he appoints and designs men to the great work
   of obedience in preaching the gospel. And in sinning, men sin against
   him.
				</p><p>
   "2dly. Our holiness, our obedience, work of righteousness, is one
   eminent and special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> end of the peculiar dispensation of Father, Son,
   and Spirit, in the business of exalting the glory of God in our
   salvation, -- of the electing love of the Father, the purchasing love
   of the Son, and the operative love of the Spirit: 
				</p><p>
   "(1st.) It is a peculiar end of the electing love of the Father, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</reference>, He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> chosen us, that we should be holy and without blame.' So
   <reference osisRef="Isa.4.3-Isa.4.4">Isaiah 4:3-4</reference> His aim and design in choosing of us was, that we should
   be holy and unblamable before him in love. This he is to accomplish,
   and will bring about in them that are his. He chooses us to salvation,
   through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth,' <reference osisRef="2Thess.2.13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</reference> This the Father designed as the first and immediate end
   of electing love; and proposes the consideration of that love as a
   motive to holiness, <reference osisRef="1John.4.8-1John.4.10">1 John 4:8-10</reference>
				</p><p>
   "(2dly.) It is so also of the exceeding love of the Son; of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the
   testimonies are innumerable. I shall give but one or two:  <reference osisRef="Titus.2.14">Titus 2:14</reference>, Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
   and purify to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.' This
   was his aim, his design, in giving himself for us; as <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25-Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:25-27</reference>,
   Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might
   sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word; that he
   might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and without
   blemish.' <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.15">2 Corinthians 5:15</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.6.11">Romans 6:11</reference>
				</p><p>
   "(3dly.) It is the very work of the love of the Holy Ghost. His whole
   work upon us, in us, for us, consists in preparing of us for obedience;
   enabling of us to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, and bringing forth the fruits of it in us.
   And this he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> in opposition to a righteousness of our own, either
   before it or to be made up by it, <reference osisRef="Titus.3.5">Titus 3:5</reference> I need not insist on
   this. The fruits of the Spirit in us are known, <reference osisRef="Gal.5.22-Gal.5.23">Galatians 5:22-23</reference>
				</p><p>
   "And thus have we a twofold bottom of the necessity of our obedience
   and personal holiness:  God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed it, he requires it; and it
   is an eminent immediate end of the distinct dispensation of Father,
   Son, and Holy Ghost, in the work of our salvation. If God's sovereignty
   over us is to be owned, if his love towards us be to be regarded, if
   the whole work of the ever-blessed Trinity, for us, in us, be of any
   moment, our obedience is necessary.
				</p><p>
   "3dly. It is necessary in respect of the end of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; and that whether
   you consider God, ourselves, or the world: 
				</p><p>
   "(1st.) The end of our obedience, in respect of God, is, his glory and
   honour, <reference osisRef="Mal.1.6">Malachi 1:6</reference> This is God's honour, -- all that we give him. It is
   true, he will take his honour from the stoutest and proudest rebel in
   the world; but all we give him is in our obedience. The glorifying of
   God by our obedience is all that we are or can be. Particularly, --
				</p><p>
   "[1st.] It is the glory of the Father. <reference osisRef="Matt.5.16">Matthew 5:16</reference>, Let your light so
   shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
   Father which is in heaven.' By our walking in the light of faith does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   glory arise to the Father. The fruits of his love, of his grace, of his
   kindness, are seen upon us; and God is glorified in our behalf. And, --
				</p><p>
   "[2dly.] The Son is glorified thereby. It is the will of God that as
   all men honour the Father, so should they honour the Son, <reference osisRef="John.5.23">John 5:23</reference>
   And how is this done? By believing in him, <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>; obeying of him.
   Hence, <reference osisRef="John.17.10">John 17:10</reference>, he says he is glorified in believers; and prays
   for an increase of grace and union for them, that he may yet be more
   glorified, and all might know that, as mediator, he was sent of God.
				</p><p>
   "[3dly.] The Spirit is glorified also by it. He is grieved by our
   disobedience, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.30">Ephesians 4:30</reference>; and therefore his glory is in our bringing
   forth fruit. He dwells in us, as in his temple; which is not to be
   defiled. Holiness becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> his habitation for ever.
				</p><p>
   "Now, if this that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been said be not sufficient to evince a
   necessity of our obedience, we must suppose ourselves to speak with a
   sort of men who regard neither the sovereignty, nor love, nor glory of
   God, Father, Son, or Holy Ghost. Let men say what they please, though
   our obedience should be all lost, and never regarded (which is
   impossible, for God is not unjust, to forget our labour of love), yet
   here is a sufficient bottom, ground, and reason of yielding more
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God than ever we shall do while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> we live in this world.
   I speak also only of gospel grounds of obedience, and not of those that
   are natural and legal, which are indispensable to all mankind.
				</p><p>
   "(2dly.) The end in respect of ourselves immediately is threefold: 
   [1st.] Honour. [2dly.] Peace. [3dly.] Usefulness.
				</p><p>
   "[1st.] Honour. It is by holiness that we are made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and
   his image is renewed again in us. This was our honour at our creation,
   this exalted us above all our fellow-creatures here below, -- we were
   made in the image of God. This we lost by sin, and became like the
   beasts that perish. To this honour, of conformity to God, of bearing
   his image, are we exalted again by holiness alone. Be ye holy,' says
   God, for I am holy,' <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.16">1 Peter 1:16</reference>; and, Be ye perfect' (that is, in
   doing good), even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,' <reference osisRef="Matt.5.48">Matthew 5:48</reference>, -- in a likeness and conformity to him. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is the image
   of God renewed; <reference osisRef="Eph.4.23-Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:23-24</reference>, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> we put on the new man, which
   after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth.' This was
   that which originally was attended with power and dominion; -- is still
   all that is beautiful or comely in the world. How it makes men
   honourable and precious in the sight of God, of angels, of men; how
   alone it is that which is not despised, which is of price before the
   Lord; what contempt and scorn he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> of them in whom it is not, -- in
   what abomination he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> them and all their ways, -- might easily be
   evinced.
				</p><p>
   "[2dly.] Peace. By it we have communion with God, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> peace alone
   is to be enjoyed. The wicked are like the troubled sea, that cannot
   rest;' and, There is no peace' to them, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> my God,' <reference osisRef="Isa.57.20-Isa.57.21">Isaiah 57:20-21</reference> There is no peace, rest, or quietness, in a distance, separation,
   or alienation from God. He is the rest of our souls. In the light of
   his countenance is life and peace. Now, if we walk in the light, as he
   is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,' <reference osisRef="1John.1.7">1 John 1:7</reference>; and
   truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
   Christ,' verse 3. He that walks in the light of new obedience, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   communion with God, and in his presence is fulness of joy for ever;
   without it, there is nothing but darkness, and wandering, and
   confusion.
				</p><p>
   "[3dly.] Usefulness. A man without holiness is good for nothing.
   Ephraim,' says the prophet, is an empty vine, that brings forth fruit
   to itself.' And what is such a vine good for? Nothing. Says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> another
   prophet, A man cannot make so much as a pin of it, to hang a vessel
   on.' A barren tree is good for nothing, but to be cut down for the
   fire. Notwithstanding the seeming usefulness of men who serve the
   providence of God in their generations, I could easily manifest that
   the world and the church might want them, and that, indeed, in
   themselves they are good for nothing. Only the holy man is commune
   bonum.
				</p><p>
   "(3dly.) The end of it in respect of others in the world is manifold: 
				</p><p>
   "[1st.] It serves to the conviction and stopping the mouths of some of
   the enemies of God, both here and hereafter:  1. Here. <reference osisRef="1Pet.3.16">1 Peter 3:16</reference>,
   Having a good conscience; that, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they speak evil of you, as of
   evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good
   conversation in Christ.' By our keeping of a good conscience men will
   be made ashamed of their false accusations; that whereas their malice
   and hatred of the ways of God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provoked them to speak all manner of
   evil of the profession of them, by the holiness and righteousness of
   the saints, they are convinced and made ashamed, as a thief is when he
   is taken, and be driven to acknowledge that God is amongst them, and
   that they are wicked themselves, <reference osisRef="John.17.23">John 17:23</reference> 2. Hereafter. It is
   said that the saints shall judge the world. It is on this, as well as
   upon other considerations: their good works, their righteousness, their
   holiness, shall be brought forth, and manifested to all the world; and
   the righteousness of God's judgments against wicked men be thence
   evinced. See,' says Christ, these are they that I own, whom you so
   despised and abhorred; and see their works following them: this and
   that they have done, when you wallowed in your abominations,' <reference osisRef="Matt.25.42-Matt.25.43">Matthew 25:42-43</reference>
				</p><p>
   "[2dly.] The conversion of others. <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.12">1 Peter 2:12</reference>, Having your
   conversation honest among the Gentiles; that, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they speak
   against you as evil-doers, they may, by your good works, which they
   shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation,' <reference osisRef="Matt.5.16">Matthew 5:16</reference> Even
   revilers, persecutors, evil-speakers, have been overcome by the
   constant holy walking of professors; and when their day of visitation
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> come, have glorified God on that account, <reference osisRef="1Pet.3.1-1Pet.3.2">1 Peter 3:1-2</reference>
				</p><p>
   "[3dly.] The benefit of all; partly in keeping off judgments from the
   residue of men, as ten good men would have preserved Sodom: [367]
   partly by their real communication of good to them with whom they have
   to do in their generation. Holiness makes a man a good man, useful to
   all; and others eat of the fruits of the Spirit that he brings forth
   continually.
				</p><p>
   "[4thly.] It is necessary in respect of the state and condition of
   justified persons; and that whether you consider their relative state
   of acceptation, or their state of sanctification: 
				</p><p>
   "First. They are accepted and received into friendship with a holy God,
   -- a God of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, -- who hates every
   unclean thing. And is it not necessary that they should be holy who are
   admitted into his presence, walk in his sight, -- yea, lie in his
   bosom? Should they not with all diligence cleanse themselves from all
   pollution of [368] flesh and spirit, and perfect holiness in the fear
   of the Lord?
				</p><p>
   "Secondly. In respect of sanctification. We have in us a new creature,
   <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.17">2 Corinthians 5:17</reference> This new creature is fed, cherished, nourished, kept
   alive, by the fruits of holiness. To what end has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> God given us new
   hearts, and new natures? Is it that we should kill them? stifle the
   creature that is found in us in the womb? that we should give him to
   the old man to be devoured?
				</p><p>
   "[5thly.] It is necessary in respect of the proper place of holiness in
   the new covenant; and that is twofold: 
				</p><p>
   "First. Of the means to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end. God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed that holiness
   shall be the means, [369] the way to that eternal life, which, as in
   itself and originally [it] is his gift by Jesus Christ, so, with regard
   to his constitution of our obedience, as the means of attaining it,
   [it] is a reward, and God in bestowing of it a rewarder. Though it be
   neither the cause, matter, nor condition of our justification, yet it
   is the way appointed of God for us to walk in for the obtaining of
   salvation. And therefore, he that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> hope of eternal life purifies
   himself, as he is pure: and none shall ever come to that end who
   walks<note n="walketh">Auto-modernized</note> not in that way; for without holiness it is impossible to see
   God.
				</p><p>
   "Secondly. It is a testimony and pledge of adoption, -- a sign and
   evidence of grace; that is, of acceptation with God. And, --
				</p><p>
   "Thirdly. The whole expression of our thankfulness.
				</p><p>
   "Now, there is not one of all these causes and reasons of the
   necessity, the indispensable necessity of our obedience, good works,
   and personal righteousness, but would require a more large discourse to
   unfold and explain than I have allotted to the proposal of them all;
   and innumerable others there are of the same import, that I cannot
   name. He that upon these accounts does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not think universal holiness and
   obedience to be of indispensable necessity, unless also it be exalted
   into the room of the obedience and righteousness of Christ, let him be
   filthy still."
				</p><p>
   I confess this whole discourse proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> on the supposition of the
   imputation of the righteousness of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us for our
   justification. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> I have as good company as the prelacy and
   whole church of England can afford; sundry from among them having
   written large discourses in its confirmation, and the rest having, till
   of late, approved of it in others. I wish this man, or any of his
   companions in design, would undertake the answering of Bishop Downham
   on this subject. No man ever carried this matter higher than Luther;
   nor did he, in all his writings, more positively and plainly contend
   for it than in his comment on the Epistle to the Galatians; -- yet was
   that book translated into English by the approbation of the then bishop
   of London, who also prefixed himself a commendatory epistle to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it.
   The judgment of Hooker we have heard before. But what need I mention in
   particular any of the rest of those great and learned names who have
   made famous the profession of the church of England by their writings
   throughout the world? Had this man, in their days, treated this
   doctrine with his present scoffing petulancy, he had scarce been rector
   of St George, Botolph Lane, much less filled with such hopes and
   expectations of future advancements, as it is not impossible that he is
   now possessed with, upon his memorable achievements. But, on this
   supposition, I do, first, appeal to the judgment of the church of
   England itself as to the truth of the doctrine delivered in my
   discourse, and the principles which this man proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> on in his
   exceptions against it. 2. Though it be but a part of a popular
   discourse, and never intended for scholastic accuracy, yet, as to the
   assertions contained in it, I challenge this author to take and allow
   the ordinary, usual sense of the words, with the open design of them,
   and to answer them when he can. And, 3. In the meantime I appeal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   every indifferent reader whether the mere perusal of this whole passage
   do not cast this man's futilous cavils out of all consideration? So
   that I shall only content myself with very few remarks upon them: 
				</p><p>
   1. Upon my asserting the necessity of good works, he adds, "A very
   suspicious word; which, methinks, these men should be afraid to name."
   And why so? We do acknowledge that we do not seek for righteousness by
   the works of the law; we design not our personal justification by them,
   nor to merit life or salvation; but betake ourselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what even
   Bellarmine himself came to at last as the safest retreat, -- namely,
   the merits and righteousness of Christ: but for attendance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them,
   performance of them, and fruitfulness in them, we are not afraid nor
   ashamed at any time to enter into judgment with them by whom we are
   traduced. And as I have nothing to say to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this author, who is known
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me only by that portraiture and character which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given of
   himself in this book; which I could have wished, for his own sake, had
   been drawn with a mixture of more lines of truth and modesty: so I know
   there are not a few who, in the course of a vain, worldly conversation,
   while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> there is scarce a back or belly of a disciple of Christ that
   blesses<note n="blesseth">Auto-modernized</note> God upon the account of their bounty or charity (the footsteps
   of levity, vanity, scurrility, and profaneness, being, moreover, left
   upon all the paths of their haunt), are wont to declaim about holiness,
   good works, and justification by them; which is a ready way to instruct
   men to atheism, or the scorn of every thing that is professed in
   religion. But yet, 2. He shows how impotent and impertinent our
   arguments are for the proof of the necessity of holiness. And as to the
   first of them, from the commands of God, he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "That if, after all
   these commands, God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> left it indifferent whether we obey him or no,
   I hope such commands cannot make obedience necessary." Wonderful
   divinity! A man must needs be well acquainted with God and himself who
   can suppose that any of his commands shall leave it indifferent,
   whether we will obey them or no. Yea, "But will he damn men if they do
   not obey his commands for holiness?" Yes, yes; no doubt he will do so.
   Yea, "But we may be, notwithstanding this command, justified and saved
   without this holiness." False and impertinent: we are neither justified
   nor saved without them, though we are not justified by them, nor saved
   for them.
				</p><p>
   To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> my enforcement of the necessity of holiness from the ends of God
   in election and redemption, he replies, p. 127, "The Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   elected us to be holy, and the Son redeemed us to be holy; but will the
   Father elect and the Son redeem none but those who are holy, and reject
   and reprobate all others? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this election and redemption suppose
   holiness in us, or is it without any regard to it? For if we be elected
   and redeemed without any regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our own being holy, our election
   and redemption is secure, whether we be holy or not." Wonderful
   divinity again! Election and redemption suppose holiness in us! We are
   elected and redeemed with regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our own holiness that is,
   antecedently to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our election and redemption; for holiness being the
   effect and fruit of them, is that which he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note>. Not many pages
   after this, he falls into a great admiration of the catechism of the
   church of England, which none blamed that I know of, as to what is
   contained in it. But it were to be wished that he had been well
   instructed in some others, that he might not have divulged and obtruded
   on the world such crude and palpable mistakes. For this respect of
   redemption, at least, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> an antecedent holiness in us (that is,
   antecedent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it), is such a piece of foppery in religion, as a man
   would wonder how any one could be guilty of, who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> almost "pored out
   his eyes" in reading the Scripture. All the remaining cavils of this
   chapter are but the effects of the like fulsome ignorance; for out of
   some passages, scraped together from several parts of my discourse (and
   those not only cut off from their proper scope and end, which is not
   mentioned by him at all, but also mangled in their representation), he
   would frame the appearance of a contradiction between what I say on the
   one hand, that there is no peace with God to be obtained by and for
   sinners but by the atonement that is made for them in the blood of
   Jesus Christ, with the remission of sin and justification by faith
   which ensue upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> (which I hope I shall not live to hear denied by
   the church of England), and the necessity of holiness and fruitfulness
   in obedience, to maintain in our own souls a sense of that peace with
   God which we have, being justified by faith. And he who understands not
   the consistency of those things, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> little reason to despise good
   catechisms, whatever thoughts he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> had of his own sufficiency.
				</p><p>
   The whole design of what remains of this section, is to insinuate that
   there can be no necessity of holiness or obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, unless we
   are justified and saved thereby; which I knew not before to have been,
   nor indeed do yet know it to be, the doctrine of the church of England.
   But be it whose it will, I am sure it is not that of the Scripture, and
   I have so disproved it in other discourses, which this man may now see
   if he please, as that I shall not here again reassume the same
   argument; and although I am weary of consulting this woeful mixture of
   disingenuity and ignorance, yet I shall remark somewhat on one or two
   passages more, and leave him, if he please, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a due apprehension,
   that what remains is unanswerable scoffing.
				</p><p>
   The first is that of p. 131. "But, however, holiness is necessary with
   respect to sanctification: We have in us a new creature, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.17">2 Corinthians 5:17</reference>
   This new creature is fed, cherished, nourished, and kept alive, by the
   fruits of holiness. To what end has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> God given us new hearts, and new
   natures? Is it that we should kill them, stifle the creature that is
   found in us in the womb? that we should give him to the old man to be
   devoured?' The phrase of this is admirable, and the reasoning
   unanswerable; for if men be new creatures, they will certainly live new
   lives, and this makes holiness absolutely necessary, by the same reason
   that every thing necessarily is what it is: but still we inquire after
   a necessary obligation to the practice of holiness, and that we cannot
   yet discover."
				</p><p>
   The reader will see easily how this is picked out of the whole
   discourse, as that which he imagined would yield some advantage to
   reflect upon; for, let him pretend what he please to the contrary, he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> laid this end too open to be denied; and I am no way solicitous
   what will be his success in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. Had he aimed at the discovery of
   truth, he ought to have examined the whole of the discourse, and not
   thus have rent one piece of it from the other. As to the phrase of
   speech which I use, it is, I acknowledge, metaphorical; but yet, being
   used only in a popular way of instruction, is sufficiently warranted
   from the Scripture, which administers occasion and gives countenance
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every expression in it, the whole being full well understood by
   those who are exercised in the life of God. And for the reasoning of
   it, it is such as I know this man cannot answer: for the new creature,
   however he may fancy, is not a new conversation, nor a living holily;
   but it is the principle, and spiritual ability, produced in believers
   by the power and grace of the Holy Ghost, enabling them to walk in
   newness of life and holiness of conversation. And this principle being
   bestowed on us, wrought in us, for that very end, it is necessary for
   us, unless we will neglect and despise the grace which we have
   received, that we walk in holiness, and abound in the fruits of
   righteousness, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> it leads and tends. Let him answer this if he
   can, and when he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done so, answer the apostle in like manner; or
   scoff not only at me, but at him also.
				</p><p>
   The last passage I shall remark upon in this section is what he gives
   us as the sum of the whole. P. 135, "The sum of all is, that to know
   Christ is not to be thus acquainted with his person, but to understand
   his gospel in its full latitude and extent; it is not the person, but
   the gospel of Christ which is the way, the truth, and the life, which
   directs us in the way to life and happiness. And again, this
   acquaintance with Christ's person, which these men pretend to, is only
   a work of fancy, and teaches men the arts of hypocrisy," etc.
				</p><p>
   I do not know that ever I met with any thing thus crudely asserted
   among the Quakers, in contempt of the person of Christ; for whereas he
   says of himself expressly, "I am the way, the truth, and the life," to
   say he is not so (for Jesus Christ is his person, and nothing else),
   carries in it a bold contradiction, both parts of which cannot be true.
   When the subject of a proposition is owned, there may be great
   controversy about the sense of the predicate; as when Christ says he is
   the vine: there may be so also about the subject of a proposition, when
   the expression is of a third thing, and dubious; as where Christ says,
   "This is my body:" but when the person speaking is the subject, and
   speaks of himself, to deny what he says, is to give him the lie. "I am
   the way, the truth, and the life," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Christ; -- "He is not," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>
   our author, "but the gospel is so." If he had allowed our Lord Jesus
   Christ to have spoken the truth, but only to have added, "Though he was
   so, yet he was so no otherwise but by the gospel," there had been
   somewhat of modesty in the expression; but this saying, that the
   "person of Christ is not, -- the gospel is so," is intolerable. It is
   so, however, that this young man, without consulting or despising the
   exposition of all divines, ancient or modern, and the common sense of
   all Christians, should dare to obtrude his crude and undigested
   conceptions upon so great a word of Christ himself, countenanced only
   by the corrupt and false glosses of some obscure Socinians: which some
   or other may possibly in due time mind him of; I have other work to do.
				</p><p>
   But according to his exposition of this heavenly oracle, what shall any
   one imagine to be the sense of the context, where "I," and "me," spoken
   of Christ, do so often occur? Suppose that the words of that whole
   verse, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the
   Father but by me," have this sense, -- not Christ himself is the way,
   the truth, and the life, but the gospel; "No man comes to the Father
   but by me;" that is, not by me, but by "the gospel," -- must not all
   the expressions of the same nature in the context have the same
   exposition? as namely, verse 1, "Ye believe in God, believe also in
   me;" that is, not in me but in "the gospel;" -- "I go to prepare a
   place for you;" that is, not I do so, but "the gospel;" verse 3, "I
   will come again and receive you to myself;" that is, not I, but "the
   gospel" will do so; and so of all other things which Christ in that
   place seems to speak of himself. If this be his way of interpreting
   Scripture, I wonder not that he blames others for their defect and
   miscarriages in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   When I first considered these two last sections, I did not suspect but
   that he had at least truly represented my words, which he thought meet
   to reflect upon and scoff at; as knowing how easy it was for any one
   whose conscience would give him a dispensation for such an undertaking,
   to pick out sayings and expressions from the most innocent discourse,
   and odiously to propose them, as cut off from their proper coherence,
   and under a concealment of the end and the principal sense designed in
   them. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> I did not so much as read over the discourse excepted
   against; only, once or twice observing my words, as quoted by him, not
   directly to comply with what I knew to be my sense and intention, I
   turned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the particular places to discover his prevarication. But
   having gone through this ungrateful task, I took the pains to read over
   the whole digression in my book, which his exceptions are levelled
   against; and, upon my review of it, my admiration of his dealing was
   not a little increased. I cannot, therefore, but desire of the most
   partial adherers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this censurer of other men's labours, judgments,
   and expressions, but once to read over that discourse, and if they own
   themselves to be Christians, I shall submit the whole of it, with the
   consideration of his reflections upon it, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their judgments. If they
   refuse so to do, I let them know I despise their censures, and do look
   on the satisfaction they take in this man's scoffing reflections as the
   laughter of fools, or the crackling of thorns under a pot. For those
   who will be at so much pains to undeceive themselves, they will find
   that that expression of the "person of Christ" is but once or twice
   used in all that long discourse, and that occasionally; which, by the
   outcries here made against it, any one would suppose to have filled up
   almost all the pages of it. He will find, also, that I have owned and
   declared the revelation that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of himself, the properties
   of his nature, and his will, in his works of creation and providence,
   in its full extent and efficacy; and that by the knowledge of God in
   Christ, which I so much insist upon, I openly, plainly, and declaredly,
   intend nothing but the declaration that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of himself in
   Jesus Christ by the gospel: of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the knowledge of his person, the
   great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh, with what he
   did and suffered as the mediator between God and man, is the chiefest
   instance; in which knowledge consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> all our wisdom of living to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> I have no more to add, but that he by whom these things are
   denied or derided, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> openly renounce his Christianity. And that I do
   not lay this to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the charge of this doughty writer, is because I am
   satisfied that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not done it out of any such design, but partly
   out of ignorance of the things which he undertakes to write about, and
   partly to satisfy the malevolence of himself and some others against my
   person: which sort of depraved affections, where men give up themselves
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their prevalence, will blind the eyes and pervert the judgments of
   persons as wise as he.
				</p><p>
   In the first section of his fourth chapter I am not particularly
   concerned; and while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> he only vents his own conceits, be they never so
   idle or atheological, I shall never trouble myself, either with their
   examination or confutation. So many as he can persuade to be of his
   mind, -- that we have no union with Christ but by virtue of union with
   the church (the contrary of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is absolutely true); that Christ is so
   a head of rule and government to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, as that he is not a head
   of influence and supplies of spiritual life (contrary to the faith of
   the catholic church in all ages); that these assertions of his have any
   countenance from antiquity, or the least from the passages quoted out
   of Chrysostom by himself; that his glosses upon many texts of Scripture
   (which have an admirable coincidence with those of two other persons
   whom I shall name when occasion requires it) are sufficient to affix
   upon them the sense which he pleads for, will many other things of an
   equal falsehood and impertinency with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> this section is stuffed, --
   shall, without any farther trouble from me, be left to follow their own
   inclinations. But yet, not withstanding all the great pains he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   taken to instruct us in the nature of the union between Christ and
   believers, I shall take leave to prefer that given by Mr Hooker before
   it, not only as more true and agreeable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Scripture, but also as
   better expressing the doctrine of the church of England in this matter.
   And if these things please the present rulers of the church, -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   upon the matter Christ is shuffled off, and the whole of our spiritual
   union is resolved into the doctrine of the gospel, and the rule of the
   church by bishops and pastors, let it imply what contradiction it will,
   as it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the highest, seeing it is by the doctrine of the gospel that
   we are taught our union will Christ, and his rule of the church by his
   laws and Spirit, -- I have only the advantage to know somewhat more
   than I did formerly, though not much to my satisfaction.
				</p><p>
   But he that shall consider what reflections are cast in this discourse
   on the necessity of satisfaction to be made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine justice, and
   from whom they are borrowed; the miserable, weak attempt that is made
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> to reduce all Christ's mediatory actings to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his kingly
   office, and, in particular, his intercession; the faint mention that is
   made of the satisfaction of Christ, clogged with the addition of
   ignorance of the philosophy of it, as it is called, well enough
   complying with them who grant that the Lord Christ did what God was
   satisfied withal, with sundry other things of the like nature; will not
   be to seek from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> these things come, nor whither they are going, nor to
   whom our author is beholden for most of his rare notions; which it is
   an easy thing at any time to acquaint him withal.
				</p><p>
   The second section of this chapter is filled principally with
   exceptions against my discourse about the personal excellencies of
   Christ as mediator; if I may not rather say, with the reflections on
   the glory of Christ himself. [As] for my own discourse upon it, I
   acknowledge it to be weak, and not only inconceivably beneath the
   dignity and merit of the subject, but also far short of what is taught
   and delivered by many ancient writers of the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that purpose;
   and [as] for his exceptions, they are such a composition of ignorance
   and spite as is hardly to be paralleled. His entrance upon his work is
   (p. 200) as follows<note n="followeth">Auto-modernized</note>:  "Secondly, Let us inquire what they mean by
   the person of Christ, to which believers must be united. And here they
   have outdone all the metaphysical subtilties of Suarez, and have found
   out a person for Christ distinct from his Godhead and manhood; for
   there can he no other sense made of what Dr Owen tells us, -- that by
   the graces of his person' he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not mean the glorious excellencies of
   his Deity considered in itself, abstracting from the office which for
   us, as God and man, he undertook; nor the outward appearance of his
   human nature, when he conversed here on earth, nor yet as now exalted
   in glory: but the graces of the person of Christ, as he is vested with
   the office of mediation, -- his spiritual eminency, comeliness, beauty,
   as appointed and anointed by the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that great work of
   bringing home all his elect into his bosom.' Now, unless the person of
   Christ as mediator be distinct from his person as God-man, all this is
   idle talk; for what personal graces are there in Christ as mediator
   which do not belong to him either as God or man? There are some things,
   indeed, which our Saviour did and suffered, which he was not obliged
   to, either as God or man, but as mediator; but surely he will not call
   the peculiar duties and actions of an office personal graces."
				</p><p>
   I have now learned not to trust to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the honesty and ingenuity of our
   author, as to his quotations out of my book; which I find that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   here mangled and altered, as in other places, and shall therefore
   transcribe the whole passage in my own words, p. 51: [370] "It is
   Christ as mediator of whom we speak; and therefore, by the grace of his
   person,' I understand not, first, The glorious excellencies of his
   Deity considered in itself, abstracting from the office which for us,
   as God and man, he undertook; nor, secondly, The outward appearance of
   his human nature, neither when he conversed here on earth, bearing our
   infirmities (of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>, by reason of the charge that was laid upon him,
   the prophet gives quite another character, <reference osisRef="Isa.52.14">Isaiah 52:14</reference>), concerning
   which some of the ancients are very poetical in their expressions; nor
   yet as now exalted in glory; -- a vain imagination of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> makes many
   bear a false, a corrupted respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, even upon carnal
   apprehensions of the mighty exaltation of the human nature; which is
   but to know Christ after the flesh,' -- a mischief much improved by the
   abomination of foolish imagery. But this is that which I intend, -- the
   graces of the person of Christ as he is vested with the office of
   mediation, his spiritual eminency, comeliness, and beauty, etc. Now, in
   this respect the Scripture describes him as exceeding excellent,
   comely, and desirable, -- far above comparison with the chiefest,
   choicest created good, or any endearment imaginable;" which I prove at
   large from <reference osisRef="Ps.45.2">Psalms 45:2</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.4.2">Isaiah 4:2</reference>; <reference osisRef="Song.5.9">Song of Solomon 5:9</reference>, adding an explanation of
   the whole.
				</p><p>
   In the digression, some passages of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he carps at in this section,
   my design was to declare, as was said, somewhat of the glory of the
   person of Christ. To this end I considered both the glory of his divine
   and the many excellencies of his human nature; but that which I
   principally insisted on was the excellency of his person as God and man
   in one, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he was meet and able to be the mediator between God and
   man, and to effect all the great and blessed ends of his mediation.
   That our Lord Jesus Christ was God, and that there were, on that
   account, in his person the essential excellencies and properties of the
   divine nature, I suppose he will not deny; nor will he do so that he
   was truly man, and that his human nature was endowed with many glorious
   graces and excellencies which are peculiar to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. That there is a
   distinct consideration of his person as both these natures are united
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, is that which he seems to have a mind to except against. And
   is it meet that any one who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> aught else to do should spend any
   moments of that time which he knows how better to improve, in the
   pursuit of a man's impertinencies, who is so bewildered in his own
   ignorance and confidence, that he knows neither where he is nor what he
   says? Did not the Son of God, by assuming our human nature, continuing
   what he was, become what he was not? Was not the person of Christ, by
   the communication of the properties of each nature in it and to it, a
   principle of such operations as he could not have wrought either as God
   or man, separately considered? How else did God "redeem his church with
   his own blood?" or how is that true which he says, <reference osisRef="John.3.13">John 3:13</reference>, "And
   no man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
   even the Son of man, which is in heaven?" Was not the union of the two
   natures in the same person (which was a property neither of the divine
   nor human nature, but a distinct ineffable effect of divine
   condescension, wisdom, and grace, which the ancients unanimously call
   the "grace of union," whose subject is the person of Christ) that
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he was fit, meet, and able, for all the works of his mediation?
   Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Scripture, moreover, propose to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our faith and
   consolation the glory, power, and grace of the person of Christ as he
   is "God over all, blessed for ever;" and his love, sympathy, care and
   compassion as man; yet all acting themselves in the one and self same
   person of the Son of God? Let him read the first chapter of the Epistle
   to the Hebrews, and see what account he can give of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. And are not
   these such principles of Christian religion as no man ought to be
   ignorant of, or can deny, without the guilt of the heresies condemned
   in the first general councils? And they are no other principles which
   my whole discourse excepted against does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> proceed upon. But says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> our
   author, "Unless the person of Christ as mediator be distinct from his
   person as God-man, all this is idle talk." Very good! and why so? Why,
   "What personal graces are there in Christ as mediator, which do not
   belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him either as God or man?" But is he not ashamed of this
   ignorance? Is it not a personal grace and excellency that he is God and
   man in one person? which belongs not to him either as God or man. And
   are there not personal operations innumerable depending upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note>, which
   could not have been wrought by him either as God or man; as raising
   himself from the dead by his own power, and redeeming the church with
   his blood? Are not most of the descriptions that are given us of Christ
   in the Scripture, most of the operations which are assigned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him,
   such as neither belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> nor proceed from the divine or human
   nature, separately considered, but from the person of Christ, as both
   these natures are united in it? That which seems to have led him into
   the maze in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is bewildered in his ensuing discourse, is, that
   considering there are but two natures in Christ, the divine and the
   human, -- and nature is the principle of all operations, -- he supposed
   that nothing could be said of Christ, nothing ascribed to his person,
   but what was directly, formally predicated of one of his natures,
   distinctly considered. But he might have easily inquired of himself, --
   that seeing all the properties and acts of the divine nature are
   absolutely divine, and all those of the human nature absolutely human,
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it came to pass that all the operations and works of Christ, as
   mediator, are theandrical? [371] Although there be nothing in the
   person of Christ but his divine and human nature, yet the person of
   Christ is neither his divine nature nor his human; for the human nature
   is, and ever was, of itself, anupostatos; and the divine, to the
   complete constitution of the person of the Mediator, in and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its
   own hypostasis assumed the human: so that, although every energy or
   operation be drastike tes phuseos kinesis, and so the distinct natures
   are distinct principles of Christ's operations, yet his person is the
   principal or only agent; which being God-man, all the actions of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>,
   by virtue of the communication of the properties of both natures
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, are theandrical. And the excellency of this person of Christ,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was every way fitted for the work of mediation, I call
   sometimes his personal grace, and will not go to him to learn to speak
   and express myself in these things. And it is most false which he
   affirms, p. 203, "That I distinguish the graces of Christ's person as
   mediator from the graces of his person as God and man." Neither could
   any man have run into such an imagination who had competently
   understood the things which he speaks about; and the bare proposal of
   these things is enough to defeat the design of all his ensuing cavils
   and exceptions.
				</p><p>
   And as to what he closes<note n="closeth">Auto-modernized</note> withal, that "Surely I will not call the
   peculiar duties and actions of an office personal graces;" I suppose
   that he knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> not well what he intends thereby. Whatever he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   fancied about Christ being the name of an office, Jesus Christ, of whom
   we speak, is a person, and not an office; and there are no such things
   in rerum natura as the actions of an office. And if by them he intends
   the actions of a person in the discharge of an office, whatever he
   calls them, I will call the habits in Christ, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> all his
   actions in the performance of his office do proceed, "personal graces,"
   and that whether he will or no. So he is a "merciful, faithful, and
   compassionate high priest," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.17">Hebrews 2:17</reference>, iv. 15, v. 2. And all his
   actions, in the discharge of his office of priesthood, being principled
   and regulated by those qualifications, I do call them his personal
   graces, and do hope that, for the future, I may obtain his leave so to
   do. The like may be said of his other offices.
				</p><p>
   The discourse which he thus raves against is didactical, and
   accommodated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a popular way of instruction; and it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   hitherto the common ingenuity of all learned men to give an allowance
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> such discourses, so as not to exact from them an accuracy and
   propriety in expressions, such as is required in those that are
   scholastical or polemical. It is that which, by common consent, is
   allowed to the tractates of the ancients of that nature, -- especially
   where nothing is taught but what, for the substance of it, is consonant
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the truth. But this man attempts not only a severity in nibbling
   at all expressions which he fancies<note n="fancieth">Auto-modernized</note> liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his censures, but,
   with a disingenuous artifice, waiving the tenor and process of the
   discourse, which I presume he found not himself able to oppose, he
   takes out, sometimes here, sometimes there, up and down, backward and
   forward, at his pleasure, what he will, to put, if it be possible, an
   ill sense upon the whole. And, if he have not hereby given a sufficient
   discovery of his good-will towards the doing of somewhat to my
   disadvantage, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> failed in his whole endeavour; for there is no
   expression which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> fixed on as the subject of his reflections,
   which is truly mine, but that as it is used by me, and with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its end, I will defend it against him and all his co-partners,
   while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> the Scripture may be allowed to be the rule and measure of our
   conceptions and expressions about sacred things. And although at
   present I am utterly wearied with the consideration of such sad
   triflings, I shall accept from him the kindness of an obligation to so
   much patience as is necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the perusal of the ensuing leaves,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I am concerned.
				</p><p>
   First, p. 202, he would pick something, if he knew what, out of my
   quotations of <reference osisRef="Song.5.9">Song of Solomon 5:9</reference>, to express or illustrate the excellency of
   Christ; which first he calls an "excellent proof," by way of scorn. But
   as it is far from being the only proof produced in the confirmation of
   the same truth, and is applied rather to illustrate what was spoken,
   than to prove it, yet, by his favour, I shall make bold to continue my
   apprehensions of the occasional exposition of the words which I have
   given in that place, until he is pleased to acquaint me with a better;
   which, I suppose, will be long enough. For what he adds, -- "But,
   however, white and ruddy belong to his divine and human nature, and
   that without regard to his mediatory office; for he had been white in
   the glory of his Deity, and ruddy with the red earth of his humanity,
   whether he had been considered as mediator or not," -- it comes from
   the same spring of skill and benevolence with those afore. For what
   wise talk is it, of Christ's being God and man, without the
   consideration of his being mediator! as though he were ever, or ever
   should have been, God and man, but with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his mediation? His
   scoff at the red earth of Christ's humanity, represented as my words,
   is grounded upon a palpable falsification; for my words are, "He was
   also ruddy in the beauty of his humanity. Man was called Adam, from the
   red earth of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he was made. The word here used points him out as the
   second Adam, partaker of flesh and blood, because the children also
   partook of the same." And if he be displeased with these expressions,
   let him take his own time to be pleased again; it is that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I am
   not concerned. But my fault, which so highly deserved his correction,
   is, that I apply that to the person of Christ which belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   natures. But what if I say no such thing, or had no such design in that
   place? For although I do maintain a distinct consideration of the
   excellency of Christ's person, as comprising both his natures united,
   -- though every real thing in his person belongs formally and radically
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one [or other] of the natures (those other excellencies being the
   exurgency of their union), through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> his person was fitted and suited
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his mediatory operations, which in neither nature, singly
   considered, he could have performed, -- and shall continue to maintain
   it against whosoever dares directly to oppose it; yet in this place I
   intended it not, which this man knew well enough, -- the very next
   words to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what he pretends to prove it [by], being, "The beauty and
   comeliness of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the union of both these in one
   person, shall afterward be declared." And so we have an equality in
   judgment and ingenuity throughout this censure.
				</p><p>
   Hence he leaps to p. 64 of my book, thence backwards to p. 53, and then
   up and down, I know not how nor whither. He begins with p. 64: [372] --
   "And in his first digression concerning the excellency of Christ Jesus,
   to invite us to communion with him in a conjugal relation, he tells us
   that Christ is exceeding excellent and desirable in his Deity, and the
   glory of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; he is desirable and worthy our acceptation as considered
   in his humanity, in his freedom from sin, fulness of grace, etc. Now,
   though this looks very like a contradiction, that by the graces of his
   person, he meant neither the excellencies of his divine nor human
   nature; yet he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a salvo which will deliver him both from
   contradiction and from nonsense, -- that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not consider these
   excellencies of his Deity or humanity as abstracted from his office of
   mediator, though he might if he pleased: for he considers those
   excellencies which are not peculiar to the office of mediation, but
   which would have belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as God and man, whether he had been
   mediator or not. But what becomes of his distinction of the graces of
   Christ's person as mediator from the graces of his person as God and
   man, when there are no personal graces in Christ but what belong to his
   Deity or his humanity?"
				</p><p>
   I am sufficiently satisfied that he neither knows where he is nor what
   he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, or has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no due comprehension of the things he treats about.
   That which he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note>, if he intend to oppose any thing by me
   asserted, is, that whereas Christ is God, the essential properties of
   his divine nature are to be considered as the formal motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and
   object of, faith, love, and obedience; and whereas he is man also, his
   excellencies, in the glorious endowment of his human nature, with his
   alliance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, and his furniture of grace for the discharge
   of his office, are proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our faith and love in the Scripture.
   And of these things we ought to take a distinct consideration; our
   faith concerning them being not only taught in the Scripture, but fully
   confirmed in the confessions and determinations of the primitive
   church. But the person of Christ, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> these two natures are united,
   is of another distinct consideration; and such things are spoken
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> as cannot, under any single enunciation, be ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   either nature, though nothing be so but what formally belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one
   of them, or is the necessary consequent and exurgency of their union.
   See <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference> It is of the "glory of the
   Word of God made flesh" that I discourse. But this man talks of what
   would have belonged to Christ as God-man, whether he had been mediator
   or not; as though the Son of God either was, or was ever designed to
   be, or can be, considered as God-man, and not as mediator. And thence
   he would relieve himself by the calumny of assigning a distinction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   me between the graces of Christ's person as mediator, and the graces of
   his person as God and man (that is, one person); which is a mere
   figment of his own misunderstanding. Upon the whole, he comes to that
   accurate thesis of his own, -- that there are no personal graces in
   Christ but what belong to his Deity or humanity. Personal graces
   belonging to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the humanity, or human nature of Christ, -- that nature
   being anupostatos, or such as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no personal subsistence of its own,
   -- is a notion that those may thank him for who have a mind to do it.
   And he may do well to consider what his thoughts are of the grace of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, mentioned <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6-Phil.2.11">Philippians 2:6-11</reference>
				</p><p>
   But he will now discover the design of all these things, and afterward
   make it good by quotations out of my book. The first he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, p. 203,
   and onwards: "But whatever becomes of the sense of the distinction,
   there is a very deep fetch in it, the observing of which will discover
   the whole mystery of the person of Christ and our union to him. For
   these men consider that Christ saves us as he is our mediator, and not
   merely considered as God or man; and they imagine that we receive grace
   and salvation from Christ's person just as we do water out of a
   conduit, or a gift and largess from a prince, -- that it flows to us
   from our union to his person; and therefore they dress up the person of
   the Mediator with all those personal excellencies and graces which may
   make him a fit Saviour, that those who are thus united to his person
   (of which more in the next section) need not fear missing of salvation.
   Hence they ransack all the boundless perfections of the Deity, and
   whatever they can find or fancy speaks any comfort to sinners, this is
   presently a personal grace of the Mediator; -- they consider all the
   glorious effects of his mediation; and whatever great things are spoken
   of his gospel, or religion, or intercession for us, these serve as
   personal graces: so that all our hopes may be built, not on the gospel
   covenant, but on the person of Christ. So that the dispute now lies
   between the person of Christ and his gospel, -- which must be the
   foundation of our hope, -- which is the way to life and happiness."
				</p><p>
   First, We do consider and believe that Christ saves as a mediator; that
   is, as God and man in one person, exercising the office of a mediator,
   and not merely as God or man. This we believe with all the catholic
   church of Christ, and can with boldness say, He that does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not so, let
   him be anathema maran-atha. Secondly, We do not imagine, but believe
   from the Scripture, and with the whole church of God, that we receive
   grace and salvation from the person of Christ in those distinct ways
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are capable of being received; and let him be anathema who
   believes otherwise. Only, whether his putting of grace and salvation
   into the same way of reception belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his accuracy in expressing
   his own sentiments, or his ingenuity in the representation of other
   men's words, I leave undetermined. The similitudes he uses<note n="useth">Auto-modernized</note> to express
   our faith in these things, show his good-will towards scoffing and
   profaneness. We say, there is real communication of grace from the
   person of Christ, as the head of the church, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the members of
   his mystical body by his Spirit, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they are quickened,
   sanctified, and enabled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all holy obedience: and, if it be denied
   by him, he stands anathematised by sundry councils of the ancient
   church. We say not, that we receive it as "water out of a conduit,"
   which is of a limited, determined capacity; whereas we say, the person
   of Christ, by reason of his Deity, is an immense, eternal, living
   spring or fountain of all grace. And when God calls himself a "fountain
   of living water;" and the Lord Christ calls his Spirit communicated to
   believers "living water" (under which appellation he was frequently
   promised in the Old Testament); as also the grace and mercy of the
   gospel, the "water of life," -- inviting us to receive them, and to
   drink of them, -- this author may be advised to take heed of profane
   scoffing at these things. Whether any have said, that we receive grace
   and salvation from Christ, as "a gift or largess from a prince," I know
   not; if they have, the sole defect in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is, that the allusion does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   no way sufficiently set forth the freedom and bounty of Christ in the
   communication of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sinners; and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> else it offends, let
   him soberly declare, if he can. This is the charge upon us in point of
   faith and judgment; which, in one word, amounts to no more but this, --
   that we are Christians: and so, by the grace of God, we intend to
   continue, let this man deride us while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>. Thirdly, His next
   charge concerns our practice in the pursuit of these dreadful
   principles, which, by their repetition, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> exposed to scorn: "And
   therefore they dress up," etc. What does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this poor man intend? what is
   the design of all this profaneness? The declaration of the natures and
   person of Christ, -- of his grace and work, -- the ascribing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   what is directly and expressly in terms ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in the
   Scripture, or relating, as we are able, the description it gives of
   him, -- is here called, "Dressing up the person of the Mediator with
   all those personal graces that may make him a fit Saviour." The
   preparation of the person of Christ to be a fit and meet Saviour for
   sinners, which he profanely compares to the dressing up of ?, is the
   greatest, most glorious, and admirable effect that ever infinite
   wisdom, goodness, power, and love wrought and produced, or will do so
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity. And those on whom he reflects design nothing, do nothing
   in this matter, but only endeavour, according to the measure of the
   gift of Christ which they have received, to declare and explain what is
   revealed and taught in the Scripture of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; and those who exceed the
   bounds of Scripture revelation in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> (if any do so) we do abhor. And
   as for those who are united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, although we say not that they
   need not fear missing of salvation, seeing they are to be brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it, not only through the exercise of all graces, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> fear is one,
   but also through such trials and temptations as will always give them a
   fear of heed and diligence, and sometimes such a fear of the event of
   things as shall combat their faith, and shake its firmest resolves; yet
   we fear not to say, that those who are really united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ
   shall be assuredly saved; which I have proved elsewhere beyond the fear
   of any opposition from this author, or others like minded. Fourthly, He
   adds "Hence they ransack," etc. But what is the meaning of these
   expressions? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Scripture declare that Christ is God as well
   as man? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it not build all our faith, obedience, and salvation on
   that consideration? Are not the properties of the divine nature
   everywhere in the Scripture declared and proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us for the
   ingenerating and establishing faith in us, and to be the object of, and
   exercise of, all grace and obedience? And is it now become a crime that
   any should seek to declare and instruct others in these things from the
   Scripture, and to the same end for which they are in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> revealed? Is
   this, with any evidence of sobriety, to be traduced as a "ransacking
   the boundless perfections of the divine nature, to dress up the person
   of the Mediator"? Is he a Christian, or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he deserve that name, who
   contemns or despises<note n="despiseth">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of the properties of the divine
   nature in the person of Christ (see <reference osisRef="Isa.6.1-Isa.6.4">Isaiah 6:1-4</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.12.41">John 12:41</reference>; <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6">Philippians 2:6</reference>, etc.), or shall think that the grace or
   excellencies of his person do not principally consist in them, as the
   human nature is united to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>? Fifthly, "They consider all the
   glorious effects of his mediation." All the effects of Christ's
   mediation, -- all the things that are spoken of the gospel, etc., do
   all of them declare the excellency of the person of Christ, as effects
   declare their cause, and may and ought to be considered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end,
   as occasion does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> require; and no otherwise are they considered by those
   whom he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> oppose. Sixthly, But the end of these strange principles
   and practices, he tells us, is, "That all our hopes may be built, not
   on the gospel covenant, but on the person of Christ." But I say again,
   What is it that this man intends? What is become of a common regard to
   God and man? Who do so build their hopes on Christ as to reject or
   despise the gospel covenant, as he calls it? -- though I am afraid,
   should he come to explain himself, he will be at a loss about the true
   nature of the gospel covenant, as I find him to be about the person and
   grace of Christ. He tells<note n="telleth">Auto-modernized</note> us, indeed, that "Not the person of Christ,
   but the gospel, is the way." Did we ever say, "Not the covenant of
   grace, but the person of Christ is all we regard?" But from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> comes
   this causeless fear and jealousy, -- or rather, this evil surmise, that
   if any endeavour to exalt the person of Christ, immediately the
   covenant of the gospel (that is, in truth, the covenant which is
   declared in the gospel) must be discarded? Is there an inconsistency
   between Christ and the covenant? I never met with any who was so
   fearful and jealous lest too much should be ascribed in the matter of
   our salvation to Jesus Christ; and when there is no more so, but what
   the Scripture does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> expressly and in words assign to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him and affirm of
   him, instantly we have an outcry that the gospel and the covenant are
   rejected, and that a "dispute lies between the person of Christ and his
   gospel." But let him not trouble himself; for as he cannot, and as he
   knows he cannot, produce any one word or one syllable out of any
   writings of mine, that should derogate any thing from the excellency,
   nature, necessity, or use of the new covenant; so, though it may be he
   do not, and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> therefore fancy and dream of disputes between Christ
   and the gospel, we do know how to respect both the person of Christ and
   the covenant, -- both Jesus Christ and the gospel, in their proper
   places. And in particular, we do know, that as it is the person of
   Christ who is the author of the gospel, and who as mediator in his work
   of mediation gives life, and efficacy, and establishment to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   covenant of grace; so both the gospel and that covenant do declare the
   glory and design the exaltation of Jesus Christ himself. Speaking,
   therefore, comparatively, all our hopes are built on Jesus Christ, who
   alone fills all things; yet also we have our hopes in God, through the
   covenant declared in the gospel, as the way designing the rule of our
   obedience, securing our acceptance and reward. And to deal as gently as
   I can warrant myself to do with this writer, the dispute he mentions
   between the person of Christ and the gospel, which shall be the
   foundation of our hope, is only in his own fond imagination,
   distempered by disingenuity and malevolence. For, if I should charge
   what the appearance of his expressions will well bear, what he says
   seems to be out of a design, influenced by ignorance or heresy, to
   exclude Jesus Christ, God and man, from being the principal foundation
   of the church, and which all its hopes are built upon. This being the
   sum of his charge, I hope he will fully prove it in the quotations from
   my discourse, which he now sets himself to produce; assuring him that
   if he do not, but come short in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, setting aside his odious and
   foppish profane deductions, I do aver them all in plain terms, that he
   may, on his next occasion of writing, save his labour in searching
   after what he may oppose. Thus, therefore, he proceeds, p. 205: 
				</p><p>
   "To make this appear, I shall consider that account which Dr Owen gives
   us of the personal graces and excellencies of Christ, which in general
   consist in three things:  First, His fitness to save, from the grace
   of union, and the proper and necessary effects of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Secondly, His
   fulness to save, from the grace of communion, or the free consequences
   of the grace of union. And, thirdly, His excellency to endear, from his
   complete suitableness to all the wants of the souls of men. First, That
   he is fit to be a Saviour, from the grace of union. And if you will
   understand what this strange grace of union is, it is the uniting the
   nature of God and man in one person, which makes him fit to be a
   Saviour to the uttermost. He lays his hand upon God, by partaking of
   his nature; and he lays his hand on us, by partaking of our nature: and
   so becomes a days-man or umpire between both. Now, though this be a
   great truth, that the union of the divine and human nature in Christ
   did excellently qualify him for the office of a mediator, yet this is
   the unhappiest man in expressing and proving it that I have met with.
   For what an untoward representation is this of Christ's mediation, that
   he came to make peace by laying his hands on God and men, as if he came
   to part a fray or scuffle: and he might as well have named <reference osisRef="Gen.1.1">Genesis 1:1</reference>,
   or <reference osisRef="Matt.1.1">Matthew 1:1</reference>, or any other place of Scripture, for the proof of it, as
   those he mentions."
				</p><p>
   To what end it is that he cites these passages out of my discourse is
   somewhat difficult to divine. Himself confesses<note n="confesseth">Auto-modernized</note> that what is asserted
   (at least in one of them) is a great truth, only, I am "the unhappiest
   man in expressing and proving it that ever he met with." It is evident
   enough to me, that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not met with many who have treated of this
   subject, or has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> little understood those he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> met withal; so that
   there may be yet some behind as unhappy as myself. And seeing he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   so good a leisure from other occasions, as to spend his time in telling
   the world how unhappy I am in my proving and expressing of what himself
   acknowledges<note n="acknowledgeth">Auto-modernized</note> to be true, he may be pleased to take notice, that I am
   now sensible of my own unhappiness also, in having fallen under a
   diversion from better employments by such sad and woeful
   impertinencies. But being at once charged with both these
   misadventures, -- untowardness in expression, and weakness in the proof
   of a plain truth, I shall willingly admit of information, to mend my
   way of writing for the future. And the first reflection he casts on my
   expressions, is my calling the union of the two natures in Christ in
   the same person, the "grace of union;" for so he says, "If you would
   understand what this strange grace of union is." But I crave his pardon
   in not complying with his directions, for my company's sake. No man,
   who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> once consulted the writings of the ancients on this subject,
   can be a stranger to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> charis henoseos, and "gratia unionis," they so
   continually occur in the writings of all sorts of divines, both ancient
   and modern. Yea but there is yet worse behind; for, "What an untoward
   representation is this of Christ's mediation, that he came to make
   peace by laying his hands on God and men, as if he came to part a fray
   or scuffle." My words are, "The uniting of the natures of God and man
   in one person, made him fit to be a Saviour to the uttermost. He laid
   his hand upon God, by partaking of his nature, <reference osisRef="Zech.13.7">Zechariah 13:7</reference>; and he
   lays his hand upon us, by partaking of our nature, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:14, 16</reference>: and
   so becomes a days-man or umpire between both." See what it is to be
   adventurous. I doubt not but that he thought that I had invented that
   expression, or at least, that I was the first who ever applied it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   this interposition of Christ between God and man; but as I took the
   words, and so my warranty for the expression from the Scripture, <reference osisRef="Job.9.33">Job 9:33</reference>, so it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> commonly been applied by divines in the same manner,
   particularly by Bishop Usher (in his "Emmanuel," pp. 8, 9, as I
   remember); whose unhappiness in expressing himself in divinity this man
   needs not much to bewail. But let my expressions be what they will, I
   shall not escape the unhappiness and weakness of my proofs; for "I
   might," he says, "as well have quoted <reference osisRef="Gen.1.1">Genesis 1:1</reference>, and <reference osisRef="Matt.1.1">Matthew 1:1</reference>, for
   the proof of the unity of the divine and human nature in the person of
   Christ, and his fitness thence to be a Saviour, as those I named," --
   namely, <reference osisRef="Zech.13.7">Zechariah 13:7</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:14, 16</reference> Say you so? Why, then, I do
   here undertake to maintain the personal union, and the fitness of
   Christ from thence to be a Saviour, from these two texts, against this
   man and all his fraternity in design. And at present I cannot but
   wonder at his confidence, seeing I am sure he cannot be ignorant that
   one of these places, at least, -- namely, that of <reference osisRef="Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:16</reference>, -- is as
   much, as frequently, as vehemently pleaded by all sorts of divines,
   ancient and modern, to prove the assumption of our human nature into
   personal subsistence with the Son of God, that so he might be hikanos
   (fit and able to save us), as any one testimony in the whole Scripture.
   And the same truth is as evidently contained and expressed in the
   former, seeing no man could be the "fellow of the Lord of hosts" but he
   that was partaker of the same nature with him; and no one could have
   the sword of God upon him to smite him, which was needful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   salvation, but he that was partaker of our nature, or man also. And the
   mere recital of these testimonies was sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> my purpose in
   that place, where I designed only to declare, and not dispute the
   truth. If he yet think that I cannot prove what I assert from these
   testimonies, let him consult my "Vindicae Evangelicae," where,
   according as that work required, I have directly pleaded these
   scriptures to the same purpose, insisting at large on the vindication
   of one of them; and let him answer what I have there pleaded, if he be
   able. And I shall allow him to make his advantage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that purpose, if
   he please, of whatever evasions the Socinians have found out to escape
   the force of that testimony. For there is none of them of any note but
   have attempted by various artifices to shield their opinion, in denying
   the assumption of our human nature into personal union with the Son of
   God, and wherewithal his pre-existence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his nativity of the blessed
   Virgin, from the divine evidence given against it in that place of <reference osisRef="Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:16</reference>; which yet, if this author may be believed, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> make no more
   against them than <reference osisRef="Gen.1.1">Genesis 1:1</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, this severe censure, together
   with the modesty of the expression, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Christ making peace between
   God and man is compared to the parting of a fray or scuffle, may pass
   at the same rate and value with those which are gone before.
				</p><p>
   His ensuing pages are taken up, for the most part, with the
   transcription of passages out of my discourse, raked together from
   several places at his pleasure. I shall not impose the needless labour
   on the reader of a third perusal of them: nor shall I take the pains to
   restore the several passages to their proper place and coherence, which
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> rent them from, to try his skill and strength upon them
   separately and apart; for I see not that they stand in need of using
   the least of their own circumstantial evidence in their vindication. I
   shall therefore only take notice of his exceptions against them. And,
   p. 207, whereas I had said on some occasion, that on such a supposition
   we could have supplies of grace only in a moral way, it falls under his
   derision in his parenthesis; and that is a very pitiful way indeed. But
   I must yet tell him, by the way, that if he allow of no supplies of
   grace but in a moral way, he is a Pelagian, and as such, stands
   condemned by the catholic church. And when his occasions will permit
   it, I desire he would answer what is written by myself in another
   discourse, in the refutation of this sole moral operation of grace, and
   the assertion of another way of the communication of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. Leave
   fooling, and "the unhappiest man in expressing himself that ever I met
   with" will not do it; he must betake himself to another course, if he
   intend to engage into the handling of things of this nature. He adds,
   whereas I had said, "?The grace of the promises' (of the person of
   Christ you mean):" I know well enough what I mean; but the truth is, I
   know not well what he means; nor whether it be out of ignorance that he
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> indeed fancy an opposition between Christ and the promises, that
   what is ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the one must needs be derogated from the other,
   when the promise is but the means and instrument of conveying the grace
   of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; or whether it proceeds from a real dislike that the
   person of Christ -- that is, Jesus Christ himself -- should be esteemed
   of any use or consideration in religion, that he talks at this rate.
   But from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> ever it proceeds, this cavilling humour is unworthy of
   any man of ingenuity or learning. By his following parenthesis ("a
   world of sin is something") I suppose I have somewhere used that
   expression, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it is reflected on; but he quotes not the place, and
   I cannot find it. I shall therefore only at present tell him, as (if I
   remember alight) I have done already, that I will not come to him nor
   any of his companions to learn to express myself in these things; and,
   moreover, that I despise their censures. The discourses he is carping
   at in particular in this place are neither doctrinal nor argumentative,
   but consist in the application of truths before proved to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the minds
   and affections of men. And, as I said, I will not come to him nor his
   fraternity to learn how to manage such a subject, much less a logical
   and argumentative way of reasoning; nor have I any inducement to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>
   from any thing that as yet I have seen in their writings. It also
   troubles him, p. 208, that whereas I know how unsuited the best and
   most accurate of our expressions are to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the true nature and being of
   divine things, as they are in themselves, and what need we have to make
   use of allusions, and sometimes less proper expressions, to convey a
   sense of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the minds and affections of men, I had once or twice
   used that epanothosis, "if I may so say;" which yet if he had not known
   used in other good authors, treating of things of the same nature, he
   knew I could take protection against his severity under the example of
   the apostle, using words to the same purpose upon an alike occasion,
   Heb. vii. But at length he intends to be serious, and from those words
   of mine, "Here is mercy enough for the greatest, the oldest, the
   stubbornest transgressor;" he adds, "Enough, in all reason, this: what
   a comfort is it to sinners to have such a God for their Saviour, whose
   grace is boundless and bottomless, and exceeds the largest dimensions
   of their sins, though there be a world of sin in them. But what, now,
   if the divine nature itself have not such an endless, boundless,
   bottomless grace and compassion as the doctor now talks of? For at
   other times, when it serves his turn better, we can hear nothing from
   him but the naturalness of God's vindictive justice.' Though God be
   rich in mercy, he never told us that his mercy was so boundless and
   bottomless; he had given a great many demonstrations of the severity of
   his anger against sinners, who could not be much worse than the
   greatest, the oldest, and the stubbornest transgressors.'?"
				</p><p>
   Let the reader take notice, that I propose no grace in Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> or
   for such sinners, but only that which may invite all sorts of them,
   though under the most discouraging qualifications, to come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for
   grace and mercy by faith and repentance. And on supposition that this
   was my sense, as he cannot deny it to be, I add only, in answer, that
   this his profane scoffing at it, is that which reflects on Christ and
   his gospel, and God himself and his word; which must be accounted for.
   See <reference osisRef="Isa.55.7">Isaiah 55:7</reference> Secondly, For the opposition which he childishly frames
   between God's vindictive justice and his mercy and grace, it is
   answered already. Thirdly, It is false that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not told us that
   his grace is boundless and bottomless, in the sense in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I use those
   words, sufficient to pardon the greatest, the oldest, the stubbornest
   of sinners, -- namely, that turn to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by faith and repentance; and
   he who knows not how this consists with severity and anger against
   impenitent sinners, is yet to learn his catechism. But yet he adds
   farther, pp. 208, 209, "Supposing the divine nature were such a
   bottomless fountain of grace, how comes this to be a personal grace of
   the Mediator? For a mediator, as mediator, ought not to be considered
   as the fountain, but as the minister of grace. God the Father certainly
   ought to come in for a share, at least, in being the fountain of grace,
   though the doctor is pleased to take no notice of him. But how
   excellent is the grace of Christ's person above the grace of the
   gospel; for that is a bounded and limited thing, a strait gate and
   narrow way, that leads<note n="leadeth">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> life. There is no such boundless mercy as
   all the sins in the world cannot equal its dimensions, as will save the
   greatest, the oldest, and the stubbornest transgressors."
				</p><p>
   I beg the reader to believe that I am now so utterly weary with the
   repetition of these impertinencies, that I can hardly prevail with
   myself to fill my pen once more with ink about them; and I see no
   reason now to go on, but only that I have begun; and, on all accounts,
   I shall be as brief as possible. I say, then, first, I did not consider
   this boundless grace in Christ as mediator, but considered it as in him
   who is mediator; and so the divine nature, with all its properties, are
   greatly to be considered in him, if the gospel be true. But, secondly,
   It is untrue that Christ, as mediator, is only the minister of grace,
   and not the fountain of it; for he is mediator as God and man in one
   person. Thirdly, To suppose an exemption of the person of the Father
   from being the fountain of grace absolutely, in the order of the divine
   subsistence of the persons in the Trinity, and of their operations
   suited to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, upon the ascription of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, is a fond
   imagination, which could befall no man who understands any thing of
   things of this nature. It does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> as well follow, that if the Son created
   the world, the Father did not; if the Son uphold all things by the word
   of his power, the Father does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not; -- that is, that the Son is not in
   the Father, nor the Father in the Son. The acts, indeed, of Christ's
   mediation respect the ministration of grace, being the procuring and
   communicating causes of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; but the person of Christ the mediator is
   the fountain of grace. So they thought who beheld his glory, -- "The
   glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
   But the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> relation of grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father, as sending the Son;
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, as sent by him and incarnate; and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Spirit,
   as proceeding from and sent by them both, I have elsewhere fully
   declared, and shall not in this place (which, indeed, will scarce give
   admittance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any thing of so serious a nature) again insist upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>.
   Fourthly, The opposition which he would again set between Christ and
   the gospel is impious in itself; and, if he thinks to charge it on me,
   openly false. I challenge him and all his accomplices to produce any
   one word out of any writing of mine that, from a plea or pretence of
   grace in Christ, should give countenance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any in the neglect of the
   least precept given or duty required in the gospel. And notwithstanding
   all that I have said or taught concerning the boundless, bottomless
   grace and mercy of Christ towards believing, humble, penitent sinners,
   I do believe the way of gospel obedience, indispensably required to be
   walked in by all that will come to the enjoyment of God, to be so
   narrow, that no revilers, nor false accusers, nor scoffers, nor
   despisers of gospel mysteries, continuing so to be, can walk in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>;
   -- but that there is not grace and mercy declared and tendered in the
   gospel also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all sorts of sinners, under any qualifications
   whatever, who upon its invitation, will come to God through Jesus
   Christ by faith and repentance, is an impious imagination.

   A discourse much of the same nature follows, concerning the love of
   Christ, after he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> treated his person and grace at his pleasure. And
   this he takes occasion for from some passages in my book (as formerly),
   scraped together from several places, so as he thought fit and
   convenient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his purpose. P. 209, "Thus the love of Christ is an
   eternal love, because his divine nature is eternal; and it is an
   unchangeable love, because his divine nature is unchangeable; and his
   love is fruitful, for it being the love of God, it must be effectual
   and fruitful in producing all the things which he wills<note n="willeth">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   beloved. He loves life, grace, holiness into us, loves us into
   covenant, loves us into heaven. This is an excellent love, indeed,
   which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> all for us, and leaves nothing for us to do. We owe this
   discovery to an acquaintance with Christ's person, or rather with his
   divine nature; for the gospel is very silent in this matter. All that
   the gospel tells us is, that Christ loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> sinners, so as to die for
   them; that he loves good men, who believe and obey his gospel, so as to
   save them; that he continues to love them while they continue to be
   good, but hates them when they return to their old vices: and
   therefore, I say, there is great reason for sinners to fetch their
   comforts not from the gospel, but from the person of Christ, which as
   far excels the gospel as the gospel excels the law."
				</p><p>
   I do suppose the expressions mentioned are, for the substance of them,
   in my book; and shall, therefore, only inquire what it is in them which
   he excepts<note n="excepteth">Auto-modernized</note> against, and for which I am reproached, as one that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   an acquaintance with Christ's person; which is now grown so common and
   trite an expression, that were it not condited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> some men's palates
   by its profaneness, it would argue a great barrenness in this author's
   invention, that can vary no more in the topic of reviling. It had been
   well if his licenser had accommodated him with some part of his talent
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>. But what is it that is excepted against? Is it that the love of
   Christ, as he is God, is eternal? or is it that it is unchangeable? or
   is it that it is fruitful or effective of good things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the persons
   beloved? The philosopher tells us, that to [have] love for any one, is,
   Boulesthai tini ha oietai agatha, kai to kata dunamin praktikon einai
   touton. It is this efficacy of the love of Christ which must bear all
   the present charge. The meaning of my words, therefore, is, that the
   love of Christ is to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us the cause of life, grace, holiness, and the
   reward of heaven. And because it is in the nature of love to be
   effective, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ability of the person loving, of the good
   which it wills to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the object beloved, I expressed it as I thought
   meet, by loving these things to us. And I am so far on this occasion,
   and [on account of] the severe reflection on me for an acquaintance
   with Christ, from altering my thoughts, that I say still with
   confidence, he who is otherwise minded is no Christian. And if this man
   knows not how the love of Christ is the cause of grace and glory, how
   it is effective of them, and that in a perfect consistency with all
   other causes and means of them, and the necessity of our obedience, he
   may do well to abstain a little from writing, until he is better
   informed. But says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "This is an excellent love, indeed, which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   all for us, and leaves us nothing to do." But who told him so? who ever
   said so? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he think that if our life, grace, holiness, glory, be
   from the love of Christ originally causally, by virtue of his divine,
   gracious operations in us and towards us, that there is no duty
   incumbent on them who would be made partakers of them, or use or
   improve them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their proper ends? Shall we, then, to please him, say
   that we have neither life, nor grace, nor holiness, nor glory, from the
   love of Christ; but whereas most of them are our own duties, we have
   them wholly from ourselves? Let them do so who have a mind to renounce
   Christ and his gospel; I shall come into no partnership with them. [As]
   for what he adds "All that the gospel teaches us," etc., he should have
   done well to have said, as far as he knows; which is a limitation with
   a witness. If this be all the gospel which the man knows and preaches,
   I pity them whom he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taken under his instruction. Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> Christ in
   his love do nothing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the quickening and conversion of men? nothing
   to the purification and sanctification of believers? nothing as to
   their consolation and establishment? nothing as to the administration
   of strength against temptations? nothing as to supplies of grace, in
   the increase of faith, love, and obedience, etc.? This ignorance or
   profaneness is greatly to be bewailed, as his ensuing scoff, repeated
   now usque ad nauseam, about an opposition between Christ and his
   gospel, is to be despised. And if the Lord Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no other love
   but what this man will allow, the state of the church in this world
   depends on a very slender thread. But attempts of this nature will fall
   short enough of prevailing with sober Christians to forego their faith
   and persuasion, -- that it is from the love of Christ that believers
   are preserved in that condition in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> and will approve of
   them. Yea, to suppose that this is all the grace of the gospel, that
   while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> men are good Christ loves them, and when they are bad he hates
   them (both which are true); and farther, that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> by his grace
   neither make them good, nor preserve them that are so made, -- is to
   renounce all that is properly so called.
				</p><p>
   He yet proceeds, first to evert this love which I asserted, and then to
   declare his own apprehensions concerning the love of Christ. The first
   in the ensuing words, p. 210, "But, methinks this is a very odd way of
   arguing from the divine nature; for if the love of Christ as God be so
   infinite, eternal, unchangeable, fruitful, I would willingly understand
   how sin, death, and misery came into the world. For if this love be so
   eternal and unchangeable, because the divine nature is so, then it was
   always so; for God always was what he is, and that which is eternal
   could never be other than it is now: and why could not this eternal,
   and unchangeable, and fruitful love, as well preserve us from falling
   into sin, and misery, and death, as love life and holiness into us? For
   it is a little odd, first to love us into sin and death, that then he
   may love us into life and holiness: which, indeed, could not be, if
   this love of God were always so unchangeable and fruitful as this
   author persuades us it is now; for if this love had always loved life
   and holiness into us, I cannot conceive how it should happen that we
   should sin and die."
				</p><p>
   It is well if he know what it is that he aims at in these words; I am
   sure what he says does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not in the least impeach the truth which he
   designs to oppose. The name and nature of God are everywhere in the
   Scripture proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us as the object of, and encouragement to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>,
   our faith, and his love in particular is in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> represented
   unchangeable, because he himself is so; but it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not hence follow
   that God loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> any one naturally, or necessarily. His love is a free
   act of his will; and therefore, though it be like himself, such as
   becomes his nature, yet it is not necessarily determined on any object,
   nor limited as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the nature, degrees, and effects of it. He loves
   whom he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>, and as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what end he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>. Jacob he loved, and
   Esau he hated; and those effects which, from his love or out of it, he
   will communicate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, are various, according to the counsel of
   his will. Some he loves only as to temporal and common mercies, some as
   to spiritual grace and glory; for he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> mercy on whom he will have
   mercy. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> it is no way contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and inconsistent with, the
   eternity, the immutability, and fruitfulness of the love of God, that
   he suffered sin to enter into the world, or that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> dispense more
   grace in Jesus Christ under the New Testament than he did under the
   Old. God is always the same that he was; love in God is always of the
   same nature that it was; but the objects, acts, and effects of this
   love, with the measures and degrees of them, are the issues of the
   counsel or free purposes of his will. Want of the understanding of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   makes this man imagine, that if God's love in Christ, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he
   loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> us, be eternal and fruitful, then must God necessarily always --
   in or out of Christ, under the old or new covenant -- love all persons,
   elect or not elect, with the same love as to the effects and fruits of
   it; which is a wondrous profound apprehension. The reader, therefore,
   if he please, may take notice, that the love which I intend, and
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> I ascribe those properties, is the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> love of God in
   Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the elect. Concerning this himself says, that he loves them
   with an everlasting love, and therefore "draws them with
   loving-kindness," <reference osisRef="Jer.31.3">Jeremiah 31:3</reference>; which love, I shall be bold to say, is
   eternal and fruitful. And hence, as he changes<note n="changeth">Auto-modernized</note> not, whereon the sons
   of Jacob are not consumed, <reference osisRef="Mal.3.6">Malachi 3:6</reference>, there being with him "neither
   variableness, nor shadow of turning," <reference osisRef="Jas.1.17">James 1:17</reference>; so accordingly he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in this matter, by his promise and oath, declared the immutability
   of his counsel, <reference osisRef="Heb.6.17-Heb.6.18">Hebrews 6:17-18</reference>, -- which seems to intimate that his
   love is unchangeable. And whereas this eternal love is in Christ Jesus
   as the way and means of making it certain in all its effects, and with
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its whole design, it is fruitful in all grace and glory,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3-Eph.1.5">Ephesians 1:3-5</reference> And if he cannot understand how, notwithstanding all this,
   sin so entered into the world under the law of creation and the first
   covenant as to defeat in us all the benefits of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, at present I
   cannot help him; for, as I am sure enough he would scorn to learn any
   thing of me, so I am not at leisure to put it to the trial.
				</p><p>
   His own account of the love of God succeeds. P. 211, "Not that I deny
   that the love of God is eternal, unchangeable, fruitful; that is, that
   God was always good, and always continues good, and manifests<note n="manifesteth">Auto-modernized</note> his
   love and goodness in such ways as are suitable to his nature, which is
   the fruitfulness of it: but then, the unchangeableness of God's love
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not consist in being always determined to the same object, but
   that he always loves for the same reason; that is, that he always loves
   true virtue and goodness, wherever he sees it, and never ceases to love
   any person till he ceases to be good: and then the immutability of his
   love is the reason why he loves no longer; for should he love a wicked
   man, the reason and nature of his love would change. And the
   fruitfulness of God's love, with respect to the methods of his grace
   and providence, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not consist in procuring what he loves by an
   omnipotent and irresistible power; for then sin and death could never
   have entered into the world: but he governs and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> good to his
   creatures, in such ways as are most suitable to their natures. He
   governs reasonable creatures by principles of reason, as he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   material world by the necessary laws of matter, and brute creatures by
   the instincts and propensities of nature."
				</p><p>
   This may pass for a system of his divinity, which how he will reconcile
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the doctrine of the church of England in her articles, she and he
   may do well to consider. But, whatever he means by the love of God
   always determined to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same object, it were an easy thing to prove,
   beyond the reach of his contradiction, that persons are the objects of
   God's eternal love, as well as things and qualifications are of his
   approbation; or, that he loves some persons with an everlasting and
   unchangeable love, so as to preserve them from all ruining evils, and
   so as they may be always meet objects of his approving love, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   glory: and whereas these things have been debated and disputed on all
   hands with much learning and diligence, our author is a very happy man
   if, with a few such loose expressions as these repeated, he thinks to
   determine all the controversies about election and effectual grace,
   with perseverance, on the Pelagian side. The hypothesis here
   maintained, that because God always and unchangeably approves of what
   is good in any, or of the obedience of his creatures, and disapproves
   or hates sin, condemning it in his law, [and] that therefore he may
   love the same person one day and hate him another, notwithstanding his
   pretences that he is constant to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the reason of his love, will
   inevitably fall into one of these conclusions:  either, that God
   indeed never loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> any man, be he who he will; or, that he is
   changeable in his love, upon outward, external reasons, as we are: and
   let him choose which he will own. In the meantime, such a love of God
   towards believers as shall always effectually preserve them meet
   objects of his love and approbation, is not to be baffled by such
   trifling impertinencies. His next reflection is on the manner of God's
   operations in the communication of grace and holiness; which, he says,
   is "not by omnipotent and irresistible power," -- confirming his
   assertion by that consideration, that then sin and death could never
   have entered into the world; which is resolved into another sweet
   supposition, that God must needs act the same power of grace towards
   all men, at all times, under each covenant, whether he will or no. But
   this it is to be a happy disputant, -- all things succeed well with
   such persons which they undertake. And as to the manner of the
   operation of grace, how far grace itself may be said to be omnipotent,
   and in its operations irresistible, I have fully declared there; where
   he may oppose and refute it, if he have any mind to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. His present
   attempt against it in those words, that God "governs reasonable
   creatures by principles of reason," is so weak in this case, and
   impertinent, that it deserves no consideration; for all the operations
   of divine grace are suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the rational constitution of our
   beings, neither was ever man so wild as to fancy any of them such as
   are inconsistent with, or do offer force to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, the faculties of our
   souls in their operations. Yea, that which elevates, aids, and assists
   our rational faculties in their operations on and towards their proper
   objects, which is the work of efficacious grace, is the principal
   preservative of their power and liberty, and can be no way to their
   prejudice. And we do, moreover, acknowledge that those proposals which
   are made in the gospel to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our reason, are eminently suited to excite
   and prevail with it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its proper use and exercise in compliance with
   them. Hence, although the habit of faith, or power of believing, be
   wrought in us by the Holy Ghost, yet the word of the gospel is the
   cause and means of all its acts, and the whole obedience which it
   produces<note n="produceth">Auto-modernized</note>. But if by "governing reasonable creatures by principles of
   reason," he intends that God deals no otherwise by his grace with the
   souls of men, but only by proposing objective arguments and motives
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a compliance with his will, without internal aids and assistance
   of grace, it is a gross piece of Pelagianism, destructive of the
   gospel, sufficiently confuted elsewhere; and he may explain himself as
   he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   His proceed is, to transcribe some other passages, taken out of my book
   here and there, in whose repetition he inserts some impertinent
   exceptions; but the design of the whole is to "state a controversy," as
   he calls it, between us and them, or those whom he calls<note n="calleth">Auto-modernized</note> "they" and
   "we," whoever they be. And this, upon the occasion of my mentioning the
   fulness of grace, life, and righteousness that is in Christ, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> in
   these words:  P. 215, "They say that these are the personal graces of
   Christ as mediator, which are inherent in him, and must be derived from
   his person; we say, they signify the perfection and excellency of his
   religion, as being the most perfect and complete declaration of the
   will of God, and the most powerful method of the divine wisdom for the
   reforming of the world, as it prescribes the only righteousness which
   is acceptable to God, and directs us in the only way to life and
   immortality."
				</p><p>
   I shall not absolutely accept of the terms of this controversy, as to
   the state of it on our part, proposed by him; and yet I shall not much
   vary from them. We say, therefore, that "Jesus Christ being full of all
   grace, excellencies, and perfections, he communicates them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in
   that degree as is necessary for us, and in proportion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his abundant
   charity and goodness towards us; and we Christians, as his body, or
   fellow-members of his human nature, receive grace and mercy, flowing
   from him to us." This state of the controversy on our side I suppose he
   will not refuse, nor the terms of it; but will own them to be ours,
   though he will not, it may be, allow some of them to be proper or
   convenient. And that he may know who his "they" are, who are at this
   end of the difference, he may be pleased to take notice that these
   words are the whole and entire paraphrase of Dr Hammond on <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference>;
   the first testimony he undertakes to answer. And when this author has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   replied to Mr Hooker, Dr Jackson, and him, and such other pillars of
   the church of England as concur with them, it will be time enough for
   me to consider how I shall defend myself against him. Or, if he will
   take the controversy on our part in terms more directly expressive of
   my mind, it is the person of Christ is the fountain of all grace to the
   church (as he well observes my judgment to be), and that from him all
   grace and mercy is derived to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; and then I do maintain, that the
   "they" whom he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note>, are not only the church of England, but the
   whole catholic church in all ages. Who the "we" are, on the other hand,
   who reject this assertion, and believe that all the testimonies
   concerning the fulness of grace in Christ, and the communication
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, do only declare the excellency of his religion, is not
   easy to be conjectured; -- for unless it be the people of Racow, I know
   not who are his associates. And let him but name three divines of any
   reputation in the church of England since the Reformation, who have
   given the least countenance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his assertions, negative or positive,
   and I will acknowledge that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> better associates in his profession
   than as yet I believe he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>. But that Jesus Christ himself, God and
   man in one person, the mediator between God and man, is not a fountain
   of grace and mercy to his church; that there is no real internal grace
   communicated by him, or derived from him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his mystical body; that
   the fulness which is in him, or said to be in him, of grace and truth,
   of unsearchable riches of grace, etc., is nothing but the doctrine
   which he taught, as the most complete and perfect declaration of the
   will of God, -- are opinions that cannot be divulged, under pretence of
   authority, without the most pernicious scandal to the present church of
   England. And if this be the man's religion, that this is all the
   fulness we receive from Christ, -- "a perfect revelation of the divine
   will concerning the salvation of mankind; which contains so many
   excellent promises that it may well be called grace;' and prescribes
   such a plain and simple religion, so agreeable to the natural notions
   of good and evil, that it may well be called truth;'?" -- and complying
   with its doctrine, or yielding obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its precepts and
   believing the promises which it gives, in our own strength, without any
   real aid, assistance, or communication of internal saving grace from
   the person of Jesus Christ, is our righteousness before God, whereon
   and for which we are justified, -- I know as well as he from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it came,
   and perhaps better than he whither it will go.
				</p><p>
   The remaining discourse of this chapter consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> of two parts: 
   First, An attempt to disprove any communication of real internal grace
   from the Lord Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> believers for their sanctification; Secondly,
   An endeavour to refute the imputation of his righteousness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us for
   our justification. In the first he contends that all the fulness of
   grace and truth said to be in Christ consists either in the doctrine of
   the gospel or in the largeness of his church. In the latter, that faith
   in Christ is nothing but believing the gospel, and the authority of
   Christ who revealed it; and by yielding obedience to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, we are
   justified before God, on the account of an internal inherent
   righteousness in ourselves. Now, these are no small undertakings; the
   first of them being expressly contrary to the sense of the catholic
   church in all ages (for the Pelagians and the Socinians are by common
   agreement excluded from an interest in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>); and the latter of them,
   contrary to the plain confessions of all the reformed churches, with
   the constant doctrine of this church of England: and therefore we may
   justly expect that they should be managed with much strength of
   argument, and evident demonstration. But the unhappiness of it is (I
   will not say his, but ours), that these are not things which our author
   as yet has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> accustomed himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; and I cannot but say, that to my
   knowledge I never read a more weak, loose, and impertinent discourse,
   upon so weighty subjects, in my whole life before: he must have little
   to do, who can afford to spend his time in a particular examination of
   it, unless it be in the exposition of those places which are almost
   verbatim transcribed out of Schlichtingius. [373] Besides, for the
   first truth which he opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note>, I have confirmed it in a discourse which
   I suppose may be made public before this come to view, beyond what I
   expect any sober reply to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> from him. Some texts of Scripture that
   mention a fulness in Christ he chooses<note n="chooseth">Auto-modernized</note> out, to manifest (to speak a
   word by the way) that indeed they do not intend any such fulness in
   Christ himself. And the first is <reference osisRef="John.1.16">John 1:16</reference>; the exposition of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   which he gives is that of Schlichtingius, who yet extends the import of
   the words beyond what he will allow. The enforcement which he gives
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his exposition, by comparing the 14th and 17th verses with the
   16th, is both weak and contradictory of itself; for the words of the
   14th verse are, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we
   beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father),
   full of grace and truth." It is evident beyond contradiction, that the
   expression, "full of grace and truth," is exegetical of his glory as
   the only begotten of the Father, which was the glory of his person, and
   not the doctrine of the gospel. And for the opposition that is made
   between the law given by Moses, and the grace and truth which came by
   Jesus Christ, I shall yet rather adhere to the sense of the ancient
   church, and the most eminent doctors of it, which, if he knows not it
   to be concerning the effectual communication of real, renewing,
   sanctifying grace by Jesus Christ, there are enow who can inform him;
   rather than that woeful gloss upon them, -- "His doctrine is called
   grace,' because accompanied with such excellent promises; and may well
   be called truth,' because so agreeable to the natural notions of good
   and evil," -- which is the confession of the Pelagian unbelief: but
   these things are not my present concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>. For the latter part of his
   discourse, in his opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the imputation of the righteousness
   of Christ, as he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not go about once to state or declare the sense
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is pleaded for, nor produces<note n="produceth">Auto-modernized</note> any one of the arguments
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> it is confirmed, and omits<note n="omitteth">Auto-modernized</note> the mention of most of the
   particular testimonies which declare and establish it; so, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   those few which he takes notice of, he expressly founds his answers
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them on that woeful subterfuge, that if they are capable of
   another interpretation, or having another sense given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, then
   nothing can be concluded from them to that purpose, -- by which the
   Socinians seek to shelter themselves from all the testimonies that are
   given to his Deity and satisfaction. But I have no concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>, as I
   said, either in his opinions or his way of reasoning; and do know that
   those who have so, need not desire a better cause nor an easier
   adversary to deal withal.
				</p><p>
   In his third section, p. 279, he enters upon his exceptions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   union of believers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ, and with great modesty, at the
   entrance of his discourse, tells us, first, "how these men," with whom
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to do, "have fitted the person of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the wants and
   necessities of the sinner;" which yet, if he denies God himself to have
   done, he is openly injurious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his wisdom and grace. The very first
   promise that was given concerning him was, that he should save sinners
   from all their wants, evils, and miseries, that might, did, or could
   befall them by the entrance of sin. But thus it falls out, when men
   will be talking of what they do not understand. Again, he adds how he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> "explained the Scripture metaphors through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the union between
   Christ and Christians is represented; but that these men, instead of
   explaining of those metaphors, turn all religion into an allegory." But
   what if one should now tell him, that his explanation of these
   metaphors is the most absurd and irrational, and argues the most
   fulsome ignorance of the mystery of the gospel, that can be imagined;
   and that, on the other side, those whom he traduces<note n="traduceth">Auto-modernized</note> do explain them
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the understanding and experience of all that believe, and that in
   a way suited and directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> by the Holy Ghost himself, to farther
   their faith, obedience, and consolation? As far as I perceive, he would
   be at no small loss how to relieve himself under this censure. The
   first thing he begins withal, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, in the first place, I fall
   under his displeasure, is about the conjugal relation between Christ
   and believers, which he treats of, p. 280. "As for example," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he,
   "Christ is called a husband, the church his spouse; and now all the
   invitations of the gospel are Christ's wooing and making love to his
   spouse; -- and what other men call believing the gospel of Christ,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we devote ourselves to his service, these men call that consent
   and contract, which make up the marriage betwixt Christ and believers.
   Christ takes us for his spouse, and we take Christ for our husband, and
   that with all the solemnities of marriage, except the ring, which is
   left out as an antichristian ceremony; Christ saying thus, This is that
   we will consent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, that I will be for you<note n="thee">Auto-modernized</note>, and you<note n="thou">Auto-modernized</note> shalt be for
   me, and not for another.' Christ gives himself to the soul with all his
   excellencies, righteousness, preciousness, graces, and eminencies, to
   be its saviour, head, and husband, -- to dwell with it in this holy
   relation; and the soul likes Christ for his excellencies, graces,
   suitableness, far above all other beloveds whatsoever, and accepts of
   Christ by the will for its husband, lord, and saviour. And thus the
   marriage is completed; and this is the day of Christ's espousals, and
   of the gladness of his heart. And now follow all mutual conjugal
   affections; which, on Christ's part, consist in delight, valuation,
   pity, compassion, bounty; on the saints' part, in delight, valuation,
   chastity, duty. But I have already corrected this fooling with
   Scripture metaphors and phrases."
				</p><p>
   It might, perhaps, not unbecome this author to be a little more sparing
   of his correction, unless his authority were more than it is, and his
   skill, also, in the management of it; for at present those whom he
   attempts upon are altogether insensible of any effects of his severity.
   But whereas he seems much at a loss how to evidence his own wisdom any
   other way than by calling them fools with whom he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to do, it is
   sufficient to plead his excuse. But what is it that he is here so
   displeased at, as unfit for a man of his wisdom to bear withal, and
   therefore calls it "fooling?" Is it that there is a conjugal relation
   between Christ and the church? -- that he is the bridegroom and husband
   of the church, and that the church is his bride and spouse? -- that he
   becomes so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it by a voluntarily, gracious act of his love, and that
   the church enters into that relation with him by their acceptance of
   him in that relation, and voluntarily giving up themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in
   faith, love, and obedience, suited to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>? Is it that he loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> his
   church and cherishes<note n="cherisheth">Auto-modernized</note> it as a husband, or that the church gives up
   itself in chaste and holy obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as her spouse? or is it my
   way and manner of expressing these things with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he is so provoked?
   If it be the latter, I desire he would, for his own satisfaction, take
   notice that I contemn his censures, and appeal to the judgment of those
   who have more understanding and experience in these things than, for
   aught I can discern by his writings, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> yet attained to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. If it
   be the former, they are all of them so proved and confirmed from the
   Scripture in that very discourse which he excepts<note n="excepteth">Auto-modernized</note> against, as that he
   is not able to answer or reply one serious word to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Indeed, to
   deny it, is to renounce the gospel and the catholic faith. It is,
   therefore, to no purpose for me here to go over again the nature of
   this relation between Christ and the church, -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> really and
   truly it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist; what it is the Scripture instructs<note n="instructeth">Auto-modernized</note> us in
   thereby; what is that love, care, and tenderness of Christ, which it
   would have us thence to learn; and what is our own duty with respect
   to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, together with the consolation thence arising: the whole of
   this work is already discharged in that discourse which these
   impertinent cavils are raised against, and that suitably to the sense
   of the church in all ages, and of all sound expositors of those very
   many places of Scripture which I have urged and insisted on to that
   purpose. Let him, if he please, a little lay aside the severity of his
   corrections and befooling of men, and answer any material passage in
   the whole discourse, if he be able; or discover any thing in it not
   agreeable to the analogy of faith, or the sense of the ancient church,
   if he can. And though he seem, both here and in some of his ensuing
   pages, to have a particular contempt of what is cited or improved out
   of the book of Canticles to this purpose; yet, if he either deny that
   that whole book does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> mystically express the conjugal relation that is
   between Christ and his church, with their mutual affections and delight
   in each other, or that the places particularly insisted on by me are
   not duly applied to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their proper intention, I can, at least, confirm
   them both by the authority of such persons as whose antiquity and
   learning will exercise the utmost of his confidence in calling them
   fools for their pains.
				</p><p>
   From hence for sundry pages he is pleased to give me a little respite,
   while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> he diverts his severity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another; to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whose will and choice
   what to do in it I shall leave his peculiar concern, as knowing full
   well how easy it is for him to vindicate what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> written on this
   subject from his impertinent exceptions, if he please. In the meantime,
   if this author supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> to add to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the reputation of his ingenuity
   and modesty by assaulting with a few pitiful cavils a book written with
   so much learning, judgment, and moderation, as that is which he excepts
   against, not daring in the meantime to contend with it in any thing of
   the expository or the argumentative part of it, but only to discover a
   malevolent desire to obstruct the use which it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been of, and may
   yet farther be, to the church of God, -- I hope he will not find many
   rivals in such a design. For my part, I do suppose it more becoming
   Christian modesty and sobriety, where men have laboured according to
   their ability in the explication of the mysteries of Christian
   religion, and that with an avowed intention to promote holiness and
   gospel obedience, to accept of what they have attained, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we can
   come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a compliance with them; than, passing by whatever we cannot
   but approve of, or are not able to disprove, to make it our business to
   cavil at such expressions as either we do not like, or hope to pervert
   and abuse to their disadvantage.
				</p><p>
   P. 296, he returns again to my discourse, and fiercely pursues it for
   sundry leaves, in such a manner as becomes him, and is usual with him.
   That part of my book which he deals withal, is from p. 176 [374] to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   p. 187; and if any person of ingenuity and judgment will be pleased but
   to peruse it, and to compare it with this man's exceptions, I am secure
   it will need no farther vindication. But as it is represented in his
   cavilling way, it is impossible for any man either to conceive what is
   the true design of my discourse, or what the arguments with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> what I
   assert is confirmed; which he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> most unduly pretend to give an
   account of: for he so chops, and changes, and alters at his pleasure,
   going backwards and forwards, and that from one thing to another,
   without any regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a scholastic or ingenuous debate of any thing
   that might be called a controversy, merely to seek out an appearance of
   advantage to vent his cavilling exceptions, as no judgment can
   rationally be made of his whole discourse, but only that he had a mind
   to have cast aspersions on mine, if he had known how. But such stuff as
   it is, we must now take the measure of it, and consider of what use it
   may be. And first he quotes those words from my book, "That Christ
   fulfilled all righteousness as he was mediator; and that whatever he
   did as mediator, he did it for them whose mediator he was, or in whose
   stead and for whose good he executed the office of a mediator before
   God: and hence it is that his complete and perfect obedience to the law
   is reckoned to us." He adds, "This is well said, if it were as well
   proved. And because this is a matter of great consequence, I shall
   first examine those reasons the doctor alleges to prove that Christ
   fulfilled all righteousness, as he was mediator, in their stead whose
   mediator he was."
				</p><p>
   These assertions are gathered up from several places in my discourse,
   though p. 182 [375] is cited for them all. And if any one find himself
   concerned in these things, I may demand of him the labour of their
   perusal in my book itself; and for those who shall refuse a compliance
   with so reasonable a request, I do not esteem myself obliged to tender
   them any farther satisfaction. However, I say again, that the Lord
   Christ fulfilled all righteousness as mediator; and that what he did as
   mediator, he did it for them whose mediator he was, or in whose stead
   and for whose good he executed the office of a mediator before God. He
   says, "It is well said, if it were as well proved." I say, it is all
   proved in the places where it is asserted, and that with such
   testimonies and arguments as he dares not touch upon. And although he
   pretends to examine the reasons that I allege to prove that Christ
   fulfilled all righteousness, as he was mediator, in their stead whose
   mediator he was, yet indeed he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not do so. For, first, I say no
   such thing as he here feigns me to say, -- namely, that "Christ as
   mediator fulfilled all righteousness in our stead;" but only, that
   "Christ being the mediator, in our stead fulfilled all righteousness:"
   which is another thing, though perhaps he understands not the
   difference. Nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he so much as take notice of that testimony which
   is immediately subjoined to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the words he cites in the confirmation of
   them; but he will disprove this assertion or at least manifest that it
   cannot be proved. And this he enters upon, p. 297, "As for the first,
   we have some reason to require good proof of this, since the notion of
   a mediator includes no such thing. A mediator is one who interposes<note n="interposeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   between two differing parties, to accommodate the difference; but it
   was never heard of yet, that it was the office of a mediator to perform
   the terms and conditions himself. Moses was the mediator of the first
   covenant, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.19">Galatians 3:19</reference>; and his office was to receive the law from God,
   to deliver it to the people, to command them to observe those rites,
   and sacrifices, and expiations which God had ordained: but he was not
   to fulfil the righteousness of the law for the whole congregation. Thus
   Christ is now the mediator of a better covenant; and his office
   required that he should preach the gospel, which contains the terms of
   peace and reconciliation between God and men; and since God would not
   enter into covenant with sinners without the intervention of a
   sacrifice, he dies too, as a sacrifice and propitiation for the sins of
   the world."
				</p><p>
   I yet suppose that he observed not the inconsistencies of this
   discourse, and therefore shall a little mind him of them, although I am
   no way concerned in it or them. For, first, He tells us, that "a
   mediator is one who interposes<note n="interposeth">Auto-modernized</note> between two differing parties, to
   accommodate the difference;" and then gives us an instance in Moses,
   who is called a mediator in receiving the law, but did in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> no way
   interpose himself between differing parties, to reconcile them.
   Secondly, From the nature of the mediation of Moses, he would describe
   the nature of the mediation of Christ; which Socinian fiction I could
   direct him to a sufficient confutation of, but that, thirdly, He
   rejects it himself in his next words, -- that Christ as a mediator was
   to die as a sacrifice and propitiation for the sins of the world; which
   renders his mediation utterly of another kind and nature than that of
   Moses. The mistake of this discourse is, that he supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> that men do
   argue from the general nature of the office of a mediator the work of
   mediation in this matter; when that which they do intend hence to
   prove, and what he intends to oppose, is the special nature of the
   mediatory office and work of Christ; which is peculiar, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sundry
   things essentially belonging to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, that belong not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any other
   kind of mediation whatever; of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> himself gives one signal instance.
				</p><p>
   In his ensuing pages he wonderfully perplexes<note n="perplexeth">Auto-modernized</note> himself in gathering up
   sayings, backward and forward in my discourse, to make some advantage
   to his purpose, and hopes that he is arrived at no less success than a
   discovery of I know not what contradictions in what I have asserted. As
   I said before, so I say again, that I refer the determination and
   judgment of this whole matter to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any one who will but once read over
   the discourse excepted against. But for his part, I greatly pity him,
   as really supposing him at a loss in the sense of what is yet plainly
   delivered; and I had rather continue to think so, than to be relieved
   by supposing him guilty of such gross prevarications as he must be if
   he understands what he treats about. Plainly, I have showed that there
   was a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> law of mediation, which Christ was subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, at the
   commandment of the Father: that he should be incarnate; that he should
   be the king, priest, and prophet of his church; that he should bear our
   iniquities, make his soul an offering for sin, and give his life a
   ransom for many, were the principal parts of this law. The whole of it
   I have lately explained, in my exercitations to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the second part of
   the Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews; whereon, if he please, he
   may exercise and try his skill in a way of opposition. This law our
   Lord Jesus Christ did not yield obedience to in our stead, as though we
   had been obliged originally to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the duties of it, which we neither
   were nor could be; although what he suffered penally in any of them was
   in our stead; without which consideration he could not have righteously
   suffered in any kind. And the following trivial exception of this
   author, about the obligation on us to lay down our lives for the
   brethren, is meet for him to put in, seeing we are not obliged so to
   die for any one as Christ died for us. Was Paul crucified for you? But,
   secondly, Christ our mediator, and as mediator, was obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all
   that obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the moral, and all other laws of God, that the
   church was obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; and that which I have asserted upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> is, that
   the effects of the former obedience of Christ are communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us,
   but the latter obedience itself is imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; and [I] have proved
   it by those arguments which this man does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not touch upon. All this is
   more fully, clearly, and plainly declared in the discourse itself; and
   I have only represented so much of it here again, that it might be
   evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all how frivolous are his exceptions. It is therefore to
   no purpose for me to transcribe again the quotations out of my book
   which he fills up his pages with, seeing it is but little in them which
   he excepts<note n="excepteth">Auto-modernized</note> against; and whoever pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>, may consult them at large
   in the places from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they are taken; or, because it is not easy to
   find them out singly, they are so picked up and down, backwards and
   forwards, curtailed and added to at pleasure, any one may, in a very
   little space of time, read over the whole to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his full satisfaction. I
   shall, therefore, only consider his exceptions, and haste to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> an end
   of this fruitless trouble, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I am most unwillingly engaged by
   this man's unsuspected disingenuity and ignorance.
				</p><p>
   After the citation of some passages, he adds, p. 301, "This, methinks,
   is very strange, that what he did as mediator is not imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us;
   but what he did, not as our mediator, but as a man subject to the law,
   that is imputed to us, and reckoned as if we had done it, by reason of
   his being our mediator. And it is as strange to the full, that Christ
   should do whatever was required of us by virtue of any law, when he was
   neither husband, nor wife, nor father, merchant nor tradesman, seaman
   nor soldier, captain nor lieutenant, much less a temporal prince and
   monarch. And how he should discharge the duties of these relations for
   us, which are required of us by certain laws, when he never was in any
   of these relations, and could not possibly be in all, is an argument
   which may exercise the subtilty of schoolmen, and to them I leave it."
				</p><p>
   It were greatly to be desired that he would be a little more heedful,
   and with attention read the writings of other men, that he might
   understand them before he comes to make such a bluster in his
   opposition to them: for I had told him plainly, that though there was a
   peculiar law of mediation, whose acts and duties we had no obligation
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, yet the Lord Christ, even as mediator, was obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and did
   personally perform, all the duties of obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law of God
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> we were subject and obliged, p. 181, [376] sec. 14. And it is
   strange to apprehend how he came to imagine that I said he did it not
   as our mediator, but as a private man. That which, possibly, might cast
   his thoughts into this disorder was, that he knew not that Christ was
   made a private man as mediator; which yet the Scripture is sufficiently
   express in. [As] for the following objections, that the Lord Christ was
   neither "husband nor wife, father nor tradesman," etc. (in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> yet
   possibly he is out in his account), I have frequently smiled at it when
   I have met with it in the Socinians, who are perking with it at every
   turn; but here it ought to be admired. But yet, without troubling those
   bugbears the schoolmen, he may be pleased to take notice, that the
   grace of duty and obedience in all relations is the same, -- the
   relations administering only an external occasion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its peculiar
   exercise; and what our Lord Jesus Christ did in the fulfilling of all
   righteousness in the circumstances and relations in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he stood, may
   be imputed to us for our righteousness in all our relations, every act
   of duty and sin in them respecting the same law and principle. And
   upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> all his following exceptions for sundry pages, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he seems
   much to have pleased himself, do fall to nothing, as being resolved
   into his own mistakes, if he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not prevaricate against his science
   and conscience; for the sum of them all he gives us in these words, p.
   204, "That Christ did those things as mediator which did not belong to
   the laws of his mediation;" which, in what sense he did so, is fully
   explained in my discourse. And I am apt to guess, that either he is
   deceived or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> design to deceive, in expressing it by the "laws of
   his mediation;" which may comprise all the laws which as mediator he
   was subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. And so it is most true, that he did nothing as
   mediator but what belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the laws of his mediation; but most
   false, that I have affirmed that he did: for I did distinguish between
   that peculiar law which required the public acts of his mediation, and
   those other laws which, as mediator, he was made subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. And if
   he neither does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> nor will understand these things when he is told them,
   and they are proved to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him beyond what he can contradict, I know no
   reason why I should trouble myself with one that contends with his own
   mormos, though he never so lewdly or loudly call my name upon them. And
   whereas I know myself sufficiently subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mistakes and slips, so
   when I actually fall into them, as I shall not desire this man's
   forgiveness, but leave him to exercise the utmost of his severity, so I
   despise his ridiculous attempts to represent contradictions in my
   discourse, p. 306; all pretences to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> are taken from his own
   ignorance, or feigned in his imagination. Of the like nature are all
   his ensuing cavils. I desire no more of any reader, but to peruse the
   places in my discourse which he carps at, and if he be a person of
   ordinary understanding in these things, I declare that I will stand to
   his censure and judgment, without giving him the least farther
   intimation of the sense and intention<note n="intendment">Auto-modernized</note> of what I have written, or
   vindication of its truth. Thus, whereas I had plainly declared that the
   way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, in his own person, became obnoxious and
   subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law of creation, was by his own voluntary antecedent
   choice, otherwise than it is with those who are inevitably subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it by natural generation under it; as also, that the hypostatical
   union, in the first instant of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the human nature was fitted for
   glory, might have exempted him from the obligation of any outward law
   whatever, -- from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it appears that his consequential obedience, though
   necessary to himself, when he had submitted himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law (as,
   "Lo, I come to do your<note n="thy">Auto-modernized</note> will, O God"), was designedly for us; -- he
   miserably perplexes<note n="perplexeth">Auto-modernized</note> himself to abuse his credulous readers with an
   apprehension that I had talked, like himself, at such a rate of
   nonsense as any one in his wits must needs despise. The meaning and sum
   of my discourse he would have to be this, p. 308, "That Christ had not
   been bound to live like a man, had he not been a man," with I know not
   what futilous cavils of the like nature; when all that I insisted on
   was the reason why Christ would be a man, and live like a man; which
   was, that we might receive the benefit and profit of his obedience, as
   he was our mediator. So in the close of the same wise harangue, from my
   saying, "That the Lord Christ, by virtue of the hypostatical union,
   might be exempted, as it were, and lifted above the law, which yet he
   willingly submitted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and in the same instant in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was made
   of a woman, was made also under the law, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it
   became necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him," -- the man feigns I know not what
   contradictions in his fancy, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> there is not the least appearance
   in the words to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any one who understands the matter expressed in them.
   And that the assumption of the human nature into union with the Son of
   God, with submission to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> to be performed in that
   nature, are distinct parts of the humiliation of Christ, I shall prove
   when more serious occasion is administered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me.
				</p><p>
   In like manner he proceeds to put in his exceptions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what I
   discoursed about the laws that an innocent man is liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. For I
   said, that God never gave any other law to an innocent person, but only
   the law of his creation, with such symbolical precepts as might be
   instances of his obedience to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Something he would find fault
   with, but knows not well what; and therefore turmoils himself to give
   countenance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a putid cavil. He tells us, "That it is a great favour
   that I acknowledge, p. 310, that God might add what symbols he pleased
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law of creation." But the childishness of these impertinencies
   is shameful. To whom, I pray, is it a favour, or what does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the man
   intend by such a senseless scoff? Is there any word in my whole
   discourse intimating that God might not in a state of innocence give
   what positive laws he pleased to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> innocent persons, as means and ways
   to express that obedience which they owed into the law of creation? The
   task in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I am engaged is so fruitless, so barren of any good use,
   in contending with such impertinent effects of malice and ignorance,
   that I am weary of every word I am forced to add in the pursuit of it;
   but he will yet have it, that "an innocent person, such as Christ was
   absolutely, may be obliged for his own sake to the observation of such
   laws and institutions as were introduced by the occasion of sin, and
   respected all of them the personal sins of them that were obliged by
   them;" which if he can believe, he is at liberty, for me, to persuade
   as many as he can to be of his mind, while<note n="whilst">Auto-modernized</note> I may be left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> my own
   liberty and choice, yea, to the necessity of my mind, in not believing
   contradictions. And for what he adds, that I "know those who conceit
   themselves above all forms of external worship," I must say to him that
   at present personally I know none that do so, but fear that some such
   there are; as also others who, despising not only the ways of external
   worship appointed by God himself, but also the laws of internal faith
   and grace, do satisfy themselves in a customary observance of forms of
   worship of their own devising.
				</p><p>
   In his next attempt he had been singular, and had spoken something
   which had looked like an answer to an argument, had he well laid the
   foundation of his procedure: for that position which he designs<note n="designeth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   confutation of is thus laid down by him as mine, "There can be no
   reason assigned of Christ's obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law, but only this, that
   he did it in our stead;" whereas my words are, "That the end of the
   active obedience of Christ cannot be assigned to be that he might be
   fit for his death and oblation." And upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> what is afterward said
   against this particular end, he interprets as spoken against all other
   ends whatever, instancing in such as are every way consistent with the
   imputation of his obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; which could not be, had the only
   end of it been for himself, to fit him for his death and oblation. And
   this wilful mistake is sufficient to give occasion to combat his own
   imaginations for two or three pages together. P. 314, he pretends to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the recital of an argument of mine for the imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ, with the like pretence of attempting an answer
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it; but his design is not to manage any controversy with me, or
   against me, but, as he phrases<note n="phraseth">Auto-modernized</note> it, to expose my mistakes. I cannot,
   therefore, justly expect from him so much as common honesty will
   require, in case the real handling of a controversy in religion had
   been intended. But his way of procedure, so far as I know and
   understand, may be best suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his design. In this place, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   neither fairly nor truly report my words, nor take the least notice of
   the confirmation of my argument by the removal of objections to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it seemed liable, nor of the reasons and testimonies through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it is
   farther proved; but, taking out of my discourse what expressions he
   pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>, putting them together with the same rule, he thinks he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   sufficiently exposed my mistakes, -- the thing he aimed at. I have no
   more concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in this matter but to refer both him and the reader to
   the places in my discourse reflected on; -- him, truly to report and
   answer my arguments, if he be able; and the reader, to judge as he
   pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note> between us. And I would for this once desire of him, that if
   he indeed be concerned in these things, he would peruse my discourse
   here raved at, and determine in his own mind whether I confidently
   affirm what is in dispute, (that is, what I had then in dispute; for
   who could divine so long ago what a doughty disputant this author would
   by this time sprout up into?) and that this goes for an argument, or
   that he impudently affirms me so to do, contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his science and
   conscience, if he had not quite "pored out his eyes" before he came to
   the end of a page or two in my book. And for the state of the question
   here proposed by him, let none expect that upon so slight an occasion I
   shall divert to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the discussion of it. When this author, or any of his
   consorts in design, shall soberly and candidly, without scoffing or
   railing, in a way of argument or reasoning, becoming divines and men of
   learning, answer any of those many writings which are extant against
   that Socinian justification which he here approves and contends for, or
   those written by the divines of the church of England on the same
   subject, in the proof of what he denies, and confutation of what he
   affirms, they may deserve to be taken notice of in the same rank and
   order with those with whom they associate themselves. And yet I will
   not say but that these cavilling exceptions, giving a sufficient
   intimation of what some men would be at, if ability and opportunity did
   occur, may give occasion also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a renewed vindication of the truths
   opposed by them, in a way suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the use and edification of the
   church, in due time and season.
				</p><p>
   From p. 185 [377] of my book he retires, upon his new triumph, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> p.
   176, [378] as hoping to hook something from thence that might
   contribute to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the furtherance of his ingenious design, although my
   discourse in that place have no concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in what he treats<note n="treateth">Auto-modernized</note> about.
   But let him be heard to what purpose he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>. Thus, therefore, he
   proceeds, p. 315, "The doctor makes a great flourish with some
   Scripture phrases, that there is almost nothing that Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done
   but what we are said to do it with him; we are crucified with him, we
   are dead with him, buried with him, quickened together with him. In the
   actings of Christ there is, by virtue of the compact between him, as
   mediator, and the Father, such an assured foundation laid, that by
   communication of the fruit of these actings to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those in whose stead
   he performed them, they are said, in the participation of these fruits,
   to have done the same things with him. But he is quite out in the
   reason of these expressions, which is not that we are accounted to do
   the same things which Christ did, -- for the things here mentioned
   belong to the peculiar office of his mediation, which he told us before
   were not reckoned as done by us, -- but because we do some things like
   them. Our dying to sin is a conformity to the death of Christ; and our
   walking in newness of life is our conformity to his resurrection: and
   the consideration of the death and resurrection of Christ is very
   powerful to engage us to die to sin, and to rise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a new life. And
   this is the true reason of these phrases."
				</p><p>
   Any man may perceive, from what he is pleased here himself to report of
   my words, that I was not treating about the imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ, which he is now inveighing against; and it
   will be much more evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every one that shall cast an eye on that
   discourse. But the design of this confused rambling I have been forced
   now frequently to give an account of, and shall, if it be possible,
   trouble the reader with it no more. The present difference between us,
   which he was ambitious to represent, is only this, that whereas it
   seems he will allow that those expressions of our being "crucified with
   Christ, dead with him, buried with him, quickened with him," do intend
   nothing but only our doing of something like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that which Christ
   did; I do add, moreover, that we do those things by the virtue and
   efficacy of the grace which is communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us from what the Lord
   Christ so did and acted for us, as the mediator of the new covenant,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> alone we partake of their power, communicate in their virtue,
   and are conformed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as our head; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> I know I have, as the
   testimony of the Scripture, so the judgment of the catholic church of
   Christ on my side, and am very little concerned in the censure of this
   person, that I am "quite out in the reason of these expressions."
				</p><p>
   For what remains of his discourse, so far as I am concerned in it, it
   is made up of such expositions of some texts of Scripture as issue, for
   the most part, in a direct contradiction to the text itself, or some
   express passages of the context. So does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> that of <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4-Gal.4.5">Galatians 4:4-5</reference>, which
   he first undertakes to speak to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, giving us nothing but what was first
   invented by Crellius, in his book against Grotius, and is almost
   translated verbatim out of the comment of Schlichtingius upon the
   place; the remainder of them corruptly Socinianizing against the sense
   of the church of God. To this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> are added such pitiful mistakes, with
   reflections on me for distinguishing between obeying and suffering
   (which conceit he most profoundly disproves by showing that one may
   obey in suffering, and that Christ did so, against him who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> written
   more about the obedience of Christ in dying, or laying down his life
   for us, than he seems to have read on the same subject, as also
   concerning the ends and uses of his death; which I challenge him and
   all his companions to answer and disprove, if they can), as I cannot
   satisfy myself in the farther consideration of; no, not with that speed
   and haste of writing now used: which nothing could give countenance
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> but the meanness of the occasion, and unprofitableness of the
   argument in hand. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, this being the manner of the man, I am not
   able to give an account to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> myself or the reader of the misspense of
   more time in the review of such impertinencies. I shall add a few
   things, and conclude.
				</p><p>
   First. I desire to know whether this author will abide by what he
   asserts, as his own judgment, in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what he puts in his
   exception against in my discourse:  P. 320, "All the influence which
   the sacrifice of Christ's death, and the righteousness of his life
   have, that I can find in the Scripture, is, that to this we owe the
   covenant of grace;" that is, as he afterward explains himself, "That
   God would for the sake of Christ enter into a new covenant with
   mankind, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> pardon of sin and eternal life to them
   that believe and obey the gospel." I leave him in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> to his second
   thoughts; for as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> now expressed himself, there is no
   reconciliation of his assertion to common sense, or the fundamental
   principles of Christian religion. That God entered into the new
   covenant originally only for the sake of those things through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> that
   covenant was ratified and confirmed, and that Christ was so the
   mediator of the new covenant, that he died not for the redemption of
   transgressions under the first covenant, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the whole
   consideration of his satisfaction and of redemption, properly so
   called, is excluded; that there is no consideration to be had of his
   purchase of the inheritance of grace and glory, with many other things
   of the same importance; and that the gospel, or the doctrine of the
   gospel, is the new covenant (which is only a perspicuous declaration of
   it), are things that may become these new sons of the church of
   England, which the elder church would not have borne withal.
				</p><p>
   Secondly. The reader may take notice, that in some other discourses of
   mine now [379] published, which were all of them finished before I had
   the advantage to peruse the friendly and judicious animadversions of
   this author, he will find most of the matters which he excepts against
   both cleared, proved, and vindicated, and that those principles which
   he directs his opposition against are so established, as that I neither
   expect nor fear any such assault upon them, from this sort of men, as
   becomes<note n="becometh">Auto-modernized</note> a serious debate on things of this nature.
				</p><p>
   Thirdly. That I have confined myself, in the consideration of this
   author's discourse, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what I was personally concerned in, without
   looking at or accepting of the advantages which offered themselves of
   reflecting upon him, either as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the matter of his discourse, or
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the manner of expressing himself in its delivery. For, besides
   that I have no mind, and that for many reasons, to enter voluntarily
   into any contest with this man, the mistakes which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> apparently
   been led into by ignorance or prejudice, his fulsome errors against the
   Scripture, the doctrine of the ancient church, and the church of
   England, are so multiplied and scattered throughout the whole, that a
   discovery and confutation of them will scarce deserve the expense of
   time that must be wasted in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, until a more plausible countenance or
   strenuous defence be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. And as for what he aims<note n="aimeth">Auto-modernized</note> at, I
   know well enough where to find the whole of it, handled with more
   civility and appearance of reason; and therefore, when I am free, or
   resolved to treat concerning them, I shall do so in the consideration
   of what is taught by his authors and masters, and not of what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   borrowed from them.
				</p><p>
   Fourthly. I shall assure the reader, that as a thousand of such
   trifling cavillers or revilers, as I have had some to deal withal,
   shall neither discourage nor hinder me in the remaining service which I
   may have yet to fulfil, in the patience of God, for the church of
   Christ and truth of the gospel; nor, it may be, occasion me any more to
   divert in the least to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of what they whisper or
   clamour, unless they are able to betake themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a more sober
   and Christian way of handling things in controversy: so if they will
   not, or dare not, forego this supposed advantage of reproaching the
   doctrine of nonconformists (under which pretence they openly, and as
   yet securely, scorn and deride them, when they are all of them the
   avowed doctrines of all the reformed churches, and of this of England
   in particular); and if they think it not meet to oppose themselves and
   endeavours to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those writings which have been composed and published
   professedly in the declaration and defence of the truth scoffed at and
   impugned by them, but choose rather to exercise their skill and anger
   on passages rent out of practical discourses, accommodated in the
   manner of their delivery to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the capacity of the community of
   believers, as it is fit they should be; I do suppose that, at one time
   or other, from one hand or another, they may meet with some such
   discourse, concerning justification and the imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ, as may give them occasion to be quiet, or to
   exercise the best of their skill and industry in an opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it,
   -- as many such there are already extant, which they wisely take no
   notice of, but only rave against occasional passages in discourses of
   another nature, -- unless they resolve on no occasion to forego the
   shelter they have betaken themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
