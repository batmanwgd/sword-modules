				The Importance and Advantage of a Thorough Knowledge of Divine Truth
				
				  A Sermon
				
				    by
				
				  Jonathan Edwards
				
				        [from Works (Worcester reprint), IV:1-15.]
				
				    Hebrews 5:12 -- For when, for the time, ye ought to be teachers, ye have
				    need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles
				    of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
				
				   These words are a complaint, which the apostle makes of a certain
				   defect in the Christian Hebrews, to whom he wrote. Wherein we may
				   observe,
				
				   1. What the defect complained of is, viz., a want of such a proficiency
				   in the knowledge of the doctrines and mysteries of religion, as might
				   have been expected of them. The apostle complains of them, that they
				   had not made that progress in their acquaintance with the things of
				   divinity or things taught in the oracles of God, which they ought to
				   have made. And he means to reprove them, not merely for their
				   deficiency in spiritual and experimental knowledge of divine things,
				   but for their deficiency in a doctrinal acquaintance with the
				   principles of religion, and the truths of Christian divinity; as is
				   evident by several things.
				
				   It appears by the manner in which the apostle introduces this complaint
				   or reproof. The occasion of his introducing it, is this: in the next
				   verse but one preceding he mentions Christ's being a high priest after
				   the order of Melchizedek: "Called of God a high priest after the order
				   of Melchizedek." This Melchizedek being in the Old Testament, which was
				   the oracles of God, held forth as an eminent type of Christ, and the
				   account we there have of Melchizedek containing many gospel mysteries,
				   these the apostle was willing to point out to the Christian Hebrews.
				   But he apprehended that through their weakness in knowledge, and little
				   acquaintance in mysteries of that nature, they would not understand
				   him; and therefore breaks off for the present from saying anything
				   about Melchizedek. Thus, in verse 11, "Of whom we have many things to
				   say, and hard to be uttered; seeing ye are dull of hearing;" i.e.,
				   there are many things concerning Melchizedek, which contain wonderful
				   gospel mysteries, and which I would take notice of to you, were it not
				   that I am afraid, that through your dullness and backwardness in
				   understanding these things, you would only be puzzled and confounded by
				   my discourse, and so receive no benefit; and that it would be too hard
				   for you, as meat that is too strong.
				
				   Then come in the words of the text: "For when, for the time, ye ought
				   to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the
				   first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have
				   need of milk, and not of strong meat." As much as to say, Indeed it
				   might have been expected of you, that you should have known enough of
				   divinity, and the holy Scriptures, to be able to understand and digest
				   such mysteries: but it is not so with you.
				
				   Again, The apostle speaks of their proficiency in such knowledge as is
				   conveyed and received by human teaching; as appears by that expression,
				   "When for the time ye ought to be teachers;" which includes not only a
				   practical and experimental, but also a doctrinal knowledge of the
				   truths and mysteries of religion.
				
				   Again, The apostle speaks of such a knowledge, whereby Christians are
				   enabled to digest strong meat; i.e., to understand those things in
				   divinity which are more abstruse and difficult to be understood, and
				   which require great skill in things of this nature. This is more fully
				   expressed in the two next verses: for everyone that useth milk, is
				   unskillful in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe. But strong
				   meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who, by reason
				   of use, have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
				   Again, It is such a knowledge, that proficiency in it shall carry
				   persons beyond the first principles of religion. As here: "Ye have need
				   that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles
				   of God." Therefore the apostle, in the beginning of the next chapter,
				   advises them, "to leave the first principles of the doctrine of Christ,
				   and go on unto perfection."
				
				   2. We may observe wherein the fault of this defect appears, viz., in
				   that they had not made proficiency according to their time. For the
				   time, they ought to have been teachers. As they were Christians, their
				   business was to learn and gain Christian knowledge. They were scholars
				   in the school of Christ; and if they had improved their time in
				   learning, as they ought to have done, they might, by the time when the
				   apostle wrote, have been fit to be teachers in this school. To whatever
				   business any one is devoted, it may be expected that his perfection in
				   it shall be answerable to the time he has had to learn and perfect
				   himself-- Christians should not always remain babes, but should grow in
				   Christian knowledge; and, leaving the food of babes, which is milk,
				   should learn to digest strong meat.
				
				   DOCTRINE: Every Christian should make a business of endeavoring to grow
				   in knowledge in divinity.
				
				   This is indeed esteemed the business of divines and ministers: it is
				   commonly thought to be their work, by the study of the Scriptures, and
				   other instructive books, to gain knowledge; and most seem to think that
				   it may be left to them, as what belongeth not to others., But if the
				   apostle had entertained this notion, he would never have blamed the
				   Christian Hebrews for not having acquired knowledge enough to be
				   teachers: or if he had thought, that this concerned Christians in
				   general, only as a thing by the by, and that their time should not, in
				   a considerable measure, be taken up with this business; he never would
				   have so much blamed them, that their proficiency in knowledge had not
				   been answerable to the time which they had had to learn.
				
				   In handling this subject, I shall show,
				
				   1. What divinity is.
				
				   2. What kind of knowledge in divinity is intended.
				
				   3. Why knowledge in divinity is necessary.
				
				   4. Why all Christians should make a business of endeavoring to grow in
				   this knowledge.
				
				   First, I shall very briefly show what divinity is.
				
				   Various definitions have been given of it by those who have treated on
				   the subject. I shall not now stand to inquire which, according to the
				   rules of art, is the most accurate definition; but shall so define or
				   describe it, as I think has the greatest tendency to convey a notion of
				   it to this auditory.
				
				   By divinity is meant, that science or doctrine which comprehends all
				   those truths and rules which concern the great business of religion.
				   There are various kinds of arts and sciences taught and learned in the
				   schools, which are conversant about various objects; about the works of
				   nature in general; as philosophy; or the visible heavens, as astronomy;
				   or the sea, as navigation; or the earth, as geography; or the body of
				   man, as physic and anatomy; or the soul of man, with regard to its
				   natural powers and qualities, as logic and pneumatology; or about human
				   government, as politics and jurisprudence. But there is one science, or
				   one certain kind of knowledge and doctrine, which is above all the
				   rest, as it is concerning God and the great business of religion: this
				   is divinity; which is not learned, as other sciences, merely by the
				   improvement of man's natural reason, but is taught by God himself in a
				   certain book that he hath given for that end, full of instruction. This
				   is the rule which God hath given to the world to be their guide in
				   searching after this kind of knowledge, and is a summary of all things
				   of this nature needful for us to know. Upon this account divinity is
				   rather called a doctrine, than an art or science.
				
				   Indeed there is what is called natural religion or divinity. There are
				   many truths concerning God, and our duty to him, which are evident by
				   the light of nature. But Christian divinity, properly so called, is not
				   evident by the light of nature; it depends on revelation. Such are our
				   circumstances now in our fallen state, that nothing which it is needful
				   for us to know concerning God, is manifest by the light of nature in
				   the manner in which it is necessary for us to know it. For the
				   knowledge of no truth in divinity is of any significance to us, any
				   otherwise than, as it some way or other belongs to the gospel scheme,
				   or as it relates to a Mediator. But the light of nature teaches us no
				   truth of divinity in this matter. Therefore it cannot be said, that we
				   come to the knowledge of any part of Christian divinity by the light of
				   nature. The light of nature teaches no truth as it is in Jesus. It is
				   only the word of God, contained in the Old and New Testament, which
				   teaches us Christian divinity.
				
				   Divinity comprehends all that is taught in the Scriptures, and so all
				   that we need know, or is to be known, concerning God and Jesus Christ,
				   concerning our duty to God, and our happiness in God. Divinity is
				   commonly defined, the doctrine of living to God and by some who seem to
				   be more accurate, the doctrine of living to God by Christ. It
				   comprehends all Christian doctrines as they are in Jesus, and all
				   Christian rules directing us in living to God by Christ. There is
				   nothing in divinity, no one doctrine, no promise, no rule, but what
				   some way or other relates to the Christian and divine life, or our
				   living to God by Christ. They all relate to this, in two respects,
				   viz., as they tend to promote our living to God here in this world, in
				   a life of faith and holiness, and also as they tend to bring us to a
				   life of perfect holiness and happiness, in the full enjoyment of God
				   hereafter--But I hasten to the
				
				   Second thing proposed, viz., To show what kind of knowledge in divinity
				   is intended in the doctrine.
				
				   Here I would observe:
				
				   1. That there are two kinds of knowledge of the things of divinity,
				   viz., speculative and practical, or in other terms, natural and
				   spiritual. The former remains only in the head. No other faculty but
				   the understanding is concerned in it. It consists in having a natural
				   or rational knowledge of the things of religion, or such a knowledge as
				   is to be obtained by the natural exercise of our own faculties, without
				   any special illumination of the Spirit of God. The latter rests not
				   entirely in the head, or in the speculative ideas of things; but the
				   heart is concerned in it: it principally consists in the sense of the
				   heart. The mere intellect, without the heart, the will or the
				   inclination, is not the seat of it. And it may not only be called
				   seeing, but feeling or tasting. Thus there is a difference between
				   having a right speculative notion of the doctrines contained in the
				   word of God, and having a due sense of them in the heart. In the former
				   consists speculative or natural knowledge of the things of divinity; in
				   the latter consists the spiritual or practical knowledge of them.
				
				   2. Neither of these is intended in the doctrine exclusively of the
				   other: but it is intended that we should seek the former in order to
				   the latter. The latter, even a spiritual and practical knowledge of
				   divinity, is of the greatest importance; for a speculative knowledge of
				   it, without a spiritual knowledge, is in vain and to no purpose, but to
				   make our condemnation the greater. Yet a speculative knowledge is also
				   of infinite importance in this respect, that without it we can have no
				   spiritual or practical knowledge; as may be shown by and by.
				
				   I have already shown, that the apostle speaks not only of a spiritual
				   knowledge, but of such knowledge as can be acquired, and communicated
				   from one to another. Yet it is not to be thought, that he means this
				   exclusively of the other,. But he would have the Christian Hebrews seek
				   the one, in order to the other. Therefore the former is first and most
				   directly intended; it is intended that Christians should, by reading
				   and other proper means, seek a good rational knowledge of the things of
				   divinity. The latter is more indirectly intended, since it is to be
				   sought by the other, as its end.
				
				   But I proceed to the third thing proposed, viz., to show the usefulness
				   and necessity of knowledge in divinity.
				
				   1. There is no other way by which any means of grace whatsoever can be
				   of any benefit, but by knowledge. All teaching is in vain, without
				   learning. Therefore, the preaching of the gospel would be wholly to no
				   purpose, if it conveyed no knowledge to the mind. There is an order of
				   men whom Christ has appointed on purpose to be teachers in his church.
				   They are to teach the things of divinity. But they teach in vain, if no
				   knowledge in these things is gained by their teaching. It is impossible
				   that their teaching and preaching should be a means of grace, or of any
				   good in the hearts of their hearers, any otherwise than by knowledge
				   imparted to the understanding. Otherwise it would be of as much benefit
				   to the auditory, if the minister should preach in some unknown tongue.
				   All the difference is, that preaching in a known tongue conveys
				   something to the understanding, which preaching in an unknown tongue
				   doth not. On this account, such preaching must be unprofitable. Men in
				   such things receive nothing, when they understand nothing; and are not
				   at all edified, unless some knowledge be conveyed; agreeably to the
				   apostle's arguing in 1 Cor. 14:2-6.
				
				   No speech can be any means of grace, but by conveying knowledge.
				   Otherwise the speech is as much lost as if there had been no man there,
				   and he that spoke, had spoken only into the air; as it follows in the
				   passage just quoted, verses 6-10. He that doth not understand, can
				   receive no faith, nor any other grace; for God deals with man as with a
				   rational creature; and when faith is in exercise, it is not about
				   something he knows not what. Therefore hearing is absolutely necessary
				   to faith; because hearing is necessary to understanding: Rom. 10:14,
				   "How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" So there
				   can be no love without knowledge. It is not according to the nature of
				   the human soul, to love an object which is entirely unknown. The heart
				   cannot be set upon an object of which there is no idea in the
				   understanding. The reasons which induce the soul to love, must first be
				   understood, before they can have a reasonable influence on the heart.
				
				   God hath given us the Bible, which is a book of instructions. But this
				   book can be of no manner of profit to us, any otherwise than as it
				   conveys some knowledge to the mind: it can profit us no more than if it
				   were written in the Chinese or Tartarian language, of which we know not
				   one word.
				
				   So the sacraments of the gospel can have a proper effect no other way,
				   than by conveying some knowledge. They represent certain things by
				   visible signs. and what is the end of signs, but to convey some
				   knowledge of the things signified? Such is the nature of man, that
				   nothing can come at the heart, but through the door of the
				   understanding: and there can be no spiritual knowledge of that of which
				   there is not first a rational knowledge. It is impossible that any one
				   should see the truth or excellency of any doctrine of the gospel, who
				   knows not what that doctrine is. A man cannot see the wonderful
				   excellency and love of Christ in doing such and such things for
				   sinners, unless his understanding be first informed how those things
				   were done. He cannot have a taste of the sweetness and divine
				   excellency of such and such things contained in divinity, unless he
				   first have a notion that there are such and such things.
				
				   2. Without knowledge in divinity, none would differ from the most
				   ignorant and barbarous heathens. The heathens remain in gross
				   heathenish darkness, because they are not instructed, and have not
				   obtained the knowledge of the truths of divinity. So if we live under
				   the preaching of the gospel, this will make us to differ from them,
				   only by conveying to us more knowledge of the things of divinity.
				
				   3. If a man have no knowledge of these things, the faculty of reason in
				   him will be wholly in vain. The faculty of reason and understanding was
				   given for actual understanding and knowledge. If a man have no actual
				   knowledge, the faculty or capacity of knowing is of no use to him. And
				   if he have actual knowledge, yet if he be destitute of the knowledge of
				   those things which are the last end of his being, and for the sake of
				   the knowledge of which he had more understanding given him than the
				   beasts; then still his faculty of reason is in vain; he might as well
				   have been a beast, as a man with this knowledge. But the things of
				   divinity are the things to know which we had the faculty of reason
				   given us. They are the things which appertain to the end of our being,
				   and to the great business for which we are made. Therefore a man cannot
				   have his faculty of understanding to any purpose, any further than he
				   hath knowledge of the things of divinity.
				
				   So that this kind of knowledge is absolutely necessary. Other kinds of
				   knowledge may be very useful. Some other sciences, such as astronomy,
				   and natural philosophy, and geography, may be very excellent in their
				   kind. But the knowledge of this divine science is infinitely more
				   useful and important than of all other sciences whatever.
				
				   I come now to the fourth, and principal thing proposed under the
				   doctrine, viz., to give the reasons why all Christians should make a
				   business of endeavoring to grow in the knowledge of divinity. This
				   implies two things.
				
				   1. That Christians ought not to content themselves with such degrees of
				   knowledge in divinity as they have already obtained. It should not
				   satisfy them that they know as much as is absolutely necessary to
				   salvation, but should seek to make progress.
				
				   2. That this endeavoring to make progress in such knowledge ought not
				   to be attended to as a thing by the by, but all Christians should make
				   a business of it: they should look upon it as a part of their daily
				   business, and no small part of it neither. It should be attended to as
				   a considerable part of the work of their high calling. The reason of
				   both these may appear in the following things.
				
				   (1.) Our business should doubtless much consist in employing those
				   faculties, by which we are distinguished from the beasts, about those
				   things which are the main end of those faculties. The reason why we
				   have faculties superior to those of the brutes given us, is, that we
				   are indeed designed for a superior employment. That which the Creator
				   intended should be our main employment, is something above what he
				   intended the beasts for, and therefore hath given us superior powers.
				   Therefore, without doubt, it should be a considerable part of our
				   business to improve those superior faculties. But the faculty by which
				   we are chiefly distinguished from the brutes, is the faculty of
				   understanding. It follows then, that we should make it our chief
				   business to improve this faculty, and should by no means prosecute it
				   as a business by the by. For us to make the improvement of this faculty
				   a business by the by, is in effect for us to make the faculty of
				   understanding itself a by faculty, if I may so speak, a faculty of less
				   importance than others; whereas indeed it is the highest faculty we
				   have.
				
				   But we cannot make a business of the improvement of our intellectual
				   faculty, any otherwise than by making a business of improving ourselves
				   in actual understanding and knowledge. So that those who make not this
				   very much their business, but, instead of improving their understanding
				   to acquire knowledge, are chiefly devoted to their inferior powers, to
				   provide wherewithal to please their senses, and gratify their animal
				   appetites, and so rather make their understanding a servant to their
				   inferior powers, than their inferior powers servants to their
				   understanding; not only behave themselves in a manner not becoming
				   Christians, but also act as if they had forgotten that they are men,
				   and that God hath set them above the brutes, by giving them
				   understanding.
				
				   God hath given to man some things in common with the brutes, as his
				   outward senses, his bodily appetites, a capacity of bodily pleasure and
				   pain, and other animal faculties: and some things he hath given him
				   superior to the brutes, the chief of which is a faculty of
				   understanding and reason. Now God never gave man those faculties
				   whereby he is above the brutes, to be subject to those which he hath in
				   common with the brutes. This would be great confusion, and equivalent
				   to making man to be a servant to the beasts. On the contrary, he has
				   given those inferior powers to be employed in subserviency to man's
				   understanding; and therefore it must be a great part of man's principal
				   business, to improve his understanding by acquiring knowledge. If so,
				   then it will follow, that it should be a main part of his business to
				   improve his understanding in acquiring divine knowledge, or the
				   knowledge of the things of divinity; for the knowledge of these things
				   is the principal end of this faculty. God gave man the faculty of
				   understanding, chiefly, that he might understand divine things.
				
				   The wiser heathens were sensible that the main business of man was the
				   improvement and exercise of his understanding. But they were in the
				   dark, as they knew not the object about which the understanding should
				   chiefly be employed. That science which many of them thought should
				   chiefly employ the understanding, was philosophy; and accordingly they
				   made it their chief business to study it. But we who enjoy the light of
				   the gospel are more happy, we are not left, as to this particular, in
				   the dark. God hath told us about what things we should chiefly employ
				   our understandings, having given us a book full of divine instructions,
				   holding forth many glorious objects about which all rational creatures
				   should chiefly employ their understandings. These instructions are
				   accommodated to persons of all capacities and conditions, and proper to
				   be studied, not only by men of learning, but by persons of every
				   character, learned and unlearned, young and old, men and women.
				   Therefore the acquisition of knowledge in these things should be a main
				   business of all those who have the advantage of enjoying the Holy
				   Scriptures.
				
				   (2.) The things of divinity are things of superlative excellency, and
				   are worthy that all should make a business of endeavoring to grow in
				   the knowledge of them. There are no things so worthy to be known as
				   these things. They are as much above those things which are treated of
				   in other sciences, as heaven is above the earth. God himself, the
				   eternal Three in one, is the chief object of this science: in the next
				   place, Jesus Christ, as Godman and Mediator, and the glorious work of
				   redemption, the most glorious work that ever was wrought: then the
				   great things of the heavenly world, the glorious and eternal
				   inheritance purchased by Christ, and promised in the gospel; the work
				   of the Holy Spirit of God on the hearts of men; our duty to God, and
				   the way in which we ourselves may become like angels, and like God
				   himself in our measure: all these are objects of this science.
				
				   Such things as these have been the main subject of the study of the
				   holy patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, and the most excellent men
				   that ever were in the world, and are also the subject of the study of
				   the angels in heaven; 1 Pet. 1:10,11,12.
				
				   These things are so excellent and worthy to be known, that the
				   knowledge of them will richly pay for all the pains and labor of an
				   earnest seeking of it. If there were a great treasure of gold and
				   pearls hid in the earth, but should accidentally be found, and should
				   be opened among us with such circumstances that all might have as much
				   as they could gather of it; would not every one think it worth his
				   while to make a business of gathering it while it should last? But that
				   treasure of divine knowledge, which is contained in the Scriptures, and
				   is provided for every one to gather to himself as much of it as he can,
				   is a far more rich treasure than any one of gold and pearls. How busy
				   are all sorts of men, all over the world, in getting riches! But this
				   knowledge is a far better kind of riches, than that after which they so
				   diligently and laboriously pursue.
				
				   3. The things of divinity not only concern ministers, but are of
				   infinite importance to all Christians. It is not with the doctrines of
				   divinity as it is with the doctrines of philosophy and other sciences.
				   These last are generally speculative points, which are of little
				   concern in human life; and it very little alters the case as to our
				   temporal or spiritual interests, whether we know them or not.
				   Philosophers differ about them, some being of one opinion, and others
				   of another. And while they are engaged in warm disputes about them,
				   others may well leave them to dispute among themselves, without
				   troubling their heads much about them; it being of little concern to
				   them, whether the one or the other be in the right.
				
				   But it is not thus in matters of divinity. The doctrines: this nearly
				   concern every one. They are about those things which relate to every
				   man's eternal salvation and happiness. The common people cannot say,
				   Let us leave these matters to ministers and divines; let them dispute
				   them out among themselves as they can; they concern not us: for they
				   are of infinite importance to every man. Those doctrines of divinity
				   which relate to the essence, attributes, and subsistencies of God,
				   concern all; as it is of infinite importance to common people, as well
				   as to ministers, to know what kind of being God is. For he is the Being
				   who hath made us all, "in whom we live, and move, and have our being;"
				   who is the Lord of all; the Being to whom we are all accountable; is
				   the last end of our being, and the only fountain of our happiness.
				
				   The doctrines also which relate to Jesus Christ and his mediation, his
				   incarnation, his life and death, his resurrection and ascension, his
				   sitting at the right hand of the Father, his satisfaction and
				   intercession, infinitely concern common people as well as divines. They
				   stand in as much need of this Saviour, and of an interest in his person
				   and offices, and the things which he hath done and suffered, as
				   ministers and divines.
				
				   The same may be said of the doctrines which relate to the manner of a
				   sinner's justification, or the way in which he becomes interested in
				   the mediation of Christ. They equally concern all; for all stand in
				   equal necessity of justification before God. That eternal condemnation,
				   to which we are all naturally exposed, is equally dreadful. So with
				   respect to those doctrines of divinity, which relate to the work of the
				   Spirit of God on the heart, in the application of redemption in our
				   effectual calling and sanctification, all are equally concerned in
				   them. There is no doctrine of divinity whatever, which doth not some
				   way or other concern the eternal interest of every Christian. None of
				   the things which God hath taught us in his word are needless
				   speculations, or trivial matters; all of them are indeed important
				   points.
				
				   4. We may argue from the great things which God hath done in order to
				   give us instruction in these things. As to other sciences, he hath left
				   us to ourselves, to the light of our own reason. But the things of
				   divinity being of infinitely greater importance to us, he hath not left
				   us to an uncertain guide; but hath himself given us a revelation of the
				   truth in these matters, and hath done very great things to convey and
				   confirm to us this revelation; raising up many prophets in different
				   ages, immediately inspiring them with his Holy Spirit, and confirming
				   their doctrine with innumerable miracles or wonderful works out of the
				   established course of nature. Yea, he raised up a succession of
				   prophets, which was upheld for several ages.
				
				   It was very much for this end that God separated the people of Israel,
				   in so wonderful a manner, from all other people, and kept them
				   separate; that to them he might commit the oracles of God, and that
				   from them they might be communicated to the world. He hath also often
				   sent angels to bring divine instructions to men; and hath often himself
				   appeared to men in miraculous symbols or representations of his
				   presence; and now in these last days hath sent his own Son into the
				   world, to be his great prophet, to teach us divinity; Heb. 1 at the
				   beginning. By means of all, God hath given a book of divine
				   instructions, which contains the sum of divinity. Now, these things
				   hath God done not only for the instruction of ministers and men of
				   learning; but for the instruction of all men, of all sorts, learned and
				   unlearned, men, women, and children. And certainly if God doth such
				   great things to teach us, we ought not to do little to learn.
				
				   God hath not made giving instructions to men in things of divinity a
				   business by the by; but a business which he hath undertaken and
				   prosecuted in a course of great and wonderful dispensations, as an
				   affair in which his heart hath been greatly engaged; which is sometimes
				   in Scripture signified by the expression of God's rising early to teach
				   us, and to send prophets and teachers to us. Jer. 7:25, "Since that day
				   that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, I
				   have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up
				   early and sending them" And so, verse 13, "I spake unto you, rising up
				   early, and speaking." This is a figurative speech, signifying, that God
				   hath not done this as a by business, but as a business of great
				   importance, in which he took great care, and had his heart much
				   engaged; because persons are wont to rise early to prosecute such
				   business as they are earnestly engaged in.-- If God hath been so
				   engaged in teaching, certainly we should not be negligent in learning;
				   nor should we make growing in knowledge a by business, but a great part
				   of the business of our lives.
				
				   5. It may be argued from the abundance of the instructions which God
				   hath given us, from the largeness of that book which God hath given to
				   teach us divinity, and from the great variety that is therein
				   contained. Much was taught by Moses of old, which we have transmitted
				   down to us; after that, other books were from time to time added; much
				   is taught us by David and Solomon; and many and excellent are the
				   instructions communicated by the prophets: yet God did not think all
				   this enough, but after this sent Christ and his apostles, by whom there
				   is added a great and excellent treasure to that holy book, which is to
				   be our rule in the study of divinity.
				
				   This book was written for the use of all; all are directed to search
				   the Scriptures. John 5:39, "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think
				   ye have eternal life; and they are they that testify of me;" and Isaiah
				   34:16, "Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and read." They that read
				   and understand are pronounced blessed. Rev. 1:3, "Blessed is he that
				   readeth, and they that understand the words of this prophecy." If this
				   be true of that particular book of the Revelation, much more is it true
				   of the Bible in general. Nor is it to be believed that God would have
				   given instructions in such abundance, if he had intended that receiving
				   instruction should be only a by concernment with us.
				
				   It is to be considered, that all those abundant instructions which are
				   contained in the Scriptures were written for that end, that they might
				   be understood; otherwise they are not instructions. That which is not
				   given that the learner may understand it, is not given for the
				   learner's instruction; and unless we endeavor to grow in the knowledge
				   of divinity, a very great part of those instructions will to us be in
				   vain; for we can receive benefit by no more of the Scriptures than we
				   understand, no more than if they were locked up in an unknown tongue.
				   We have reason to bless God that he hath given us such various and
				   plentiful instruction in his word; but we shall be hypocritical in so
				   doing, if we, after all, content ourselves with but little of this
				   instruction.
				
				   When God hath opened a very large treasure before us, for the supply of
				   our wants, and we thank him that he hath given us so much; if at the
				   same time we be willing to remain destitute of the greatest part of it,
				   because we are too lazy to gather it, this will not show the sincerity
				   of our thankfulness. We are now under much greater advantages to
				   acquire knowledge in divinity, than the people of God were of old,
				   because since that time, the canon of Scripture is much increased. But
				   if we be negligent of our advantages, we may be never the better for
				   them, and may remain with as little knowledge as they.
				
				   6. However diligently we apply ourselves, there is room enough to
				   increase our knowledge in divinity, without coming to an end. None have
				   this excuse to make for not diligently applying themselves to gain
				   knowledge in divinity, that they know all already; nor can they make
				   this excuse, that they have no need diligently to apply themselves, in
				   order to know all that is to be known. None can excuse themselves for
				   want of business in which to employ themselves. Here is room enough to
				   employ ourselves forever in this divine science, with the utmost
				   application. Those who have applied themselves most closely, have
				   studied the longest, and have made the greatest attainments in this
				   knowledge, know but little of what is to be known. The subject is
				   inexhaustible. That divine Being, who is the main subject of this
				   science, is infinite, and there is no end to the glory of his
				   perfections. His works at the same time are wonderful, and cannot be
				   found out to perfection; especially the work of redemption, which is
				   that work of God about which the science of divinity is chiefly
				   conversant, is full of unsearchable wonders.
				
				   The word of God, which is given for our instruction in divinity,
				   contains enough in it to employ us to the end of our lives, and then we
				   shall leave enough uninvestigated to employ the heads of the ablest
				   divines to the end of the world. The Psalmist found an end to the
				   things that are human; but he could never find an end to what is
				   contained in the word of God; Psalm 119:96, "I have seen an end to all
				   perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding broad." There is enough in
				   this divine science to employ the understandings of saints and angels
				   to all eternity.
				
				   7. It doubtless concerns every one to endeavor to excel in the
				   knowledge of things which pertain to his profession or principal
				   calling. If it concerns men to excel in any thing or in any wisdom or
				   knowledge at all, it certainly concerns them to excel in the affairs of
				   their main profession and work. But the calling and work of every
				   Christian is to live to God. This is said to be his high calling,
				   Phil.3:14. This is the business, and, if I may so speak, the trade of a
				   Christian, his main work, and indeed should be his only work. No
				   business should be done by a Christian, but as it is some way or other
				   a part of this. Therefore certainly the Christian should endeavor to be
				   well acquainted with those things which belong to this work, that he
				   may fulfill it, and be thoroughly furnished to it.
				
				   It becomes one who is called to be a soldier, and to go a warfare, to
				   endeavor to excel in the art of war. It becomes one who is called to be
				   a mariner, and to spend his life in sailing the ocean, to endeavor to
				   excel in the art of navigation. It becomes one who professes to be a
				   physician, and devotes himself to that work, to endeavor to excel in
				   the knowledge of those things which pertain to the art of physic. So it
				   becomes all such as profess to be Christians, and to devote themselves
				   to the practice of Christianity, to endeavor to excel in the knowledge
				   of divinity.
				
				   8. It may be argued from this, that God hath appointed an order of men
				   for this end, to assist persons in gaining knowledge in these things.
				   He hath appointed them to be teachers. 1 Cor. 12:28, "And God hath set
				   some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly
				   teachers." Eph. 4:11,12, "He gave some apostles, some prophets, some
				   evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the
				   saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
				   Christ." If God hath set them to be teachers, making that their
				   business, then he hath made it their business to impart knowledge. But
				   what kind of knowledge? Not the knowledge of philosophy, or of human
				   laws, or of mechanical arts, but of divinity.
				
				   If God hath made it the business of some to be teachers, it will
				   follow, that he hath made it the business of others to be learners; for
				   teachers and learners are correlates, one of which was never intended
				   to be without the other. God hath never made it the duty of some to
				   take pains to teach those who are not obliged to take pains to learn.
				   He hath not commanded ministers to spend themselves, in order to impart
				   knowledge to those who are not obliged to apply themselves to receive
				   it.
				
				   The name by which Christians are commonly called in the New Testament
				   is disciples, the signification of which word is scholars or learners.
				   All Christians are put into the school of Christ, where their business
				   is to learn, or receive knowledge from Christ, their common master and
				   teacher, and from those inferior teachers appointed by him to instruct
				   in his name.
				
				   9. God hath in the Scriptures plainly revealed it to be his will, that
				   all Christians should diligently endeavor to excel in the knowledge of
				   divine things. It is the revealed will of God, that Christians should
				   not only have some knowledge of things of this nature, but that they
				   should be enriched with all knowledge: 1 Cor.1:4-5, "I thank my God
				   always on your behalf, for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus
				   Christ, that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
				   and in all knowledge." So the apostle earnestly prayed, that the
				   Christian Philippians might abound more and more, not only in love, but
				   in Christian knowledge: Philip. 1:9, "And this I pray, that your love
				   may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment." So the
				   Apostle Peter advises to "give all diligence, to add to faith virtue,
				   and to virtue knowledge," 2 Pet. 1:5. And the Apostle Paul, in the next
				   chapter to that wherein is the text, counsels the Christian Hebrews,
				   leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, to go on to
				   perfection. He would by no means have them always to rest only in those
				   fundamental doctrines of repentance, and faith, and the resurrection
				   from the dead, and the eternal judgment, in which they were
				   indoctrinated when they were first baptized, and had the apostle's
				   hands laid on them, at their first initiation in Christianity. See Heb.
				   6, at the beginning.
				
				   Application
				
				   The use that I would make of this doctrine is, to exhort all diligently
				   to endeavor to gain this kind of knowledge.
				
				   Consider yourselves as scholars or disciples, put into the school of
				   Christ, and therefore be diligent to make proficiency in Christian
				   knowledge. Content not yourselves with this, that you have been taught
				   your catechism in your childhood, and that you know as much of the
				   principles of religion as is necessary to salvation. So you will be
				   guilty of what the apostle warns against, viz., going no further than
				   laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, &c.
				
				   You are all called to be Christians, and this is your profession.
				   Endeavor, therefore, to acquire knowledge in things which pertain to
				   your profession.-- Let not your teachers have cause to complain, that
				   while they spend and are spent, to impart knowledge to you, you take
				   little pains to learn. It is a great encouragement to an instructor, to
				   have such to teach as make a business of learning, bending their minds
				   to it. This makes teaching a pleasure, when otherwise it will be a very
				   heavy and burdensome task.
				
				   You all have by you a large treasure of divine knowledge, in that you
				   have the Bible in your hands; therefore be not contented in possessing
				   but little of this treasure. God hath spoken much to you in the
				   Scripture; labor to understand as much of what he saith as you can. God
				   hath made you all reasonable creatures; therefore let not the noble
				   faculty of reason or understanding lie neglected. Content not
				   yourselves with having so much knowledge as is thrown in your way, and
				   as you receive in some sense unavoidably by the frequent inculcation of
				   divine truth in the preaching of the word, of which you are obliged to
				   be hearers, or as you accidentally gain in conversation; but let it be
				   very much your business to search for it, and that with the same
				   diligence and labor with which men are wont to dig in mines of silver
				   and gold.
				
				   Especially I would advise those that are young to employ themselves in
				   this way. Men are never too old to learn; but the time of youth is
				   especially the time for learning; it is especially proper for gaining
				   and storing up knowledge. Further, to stir up all, both old and young,
				   to this duty, let me entreat you to consider,
				
				   1. If you apply yourselves diligently to this work, you will not want
				   employment, when you are at leisure from your common secular business.
				   In this way, you may find something in which you may profitably employ
				   yourselves these long winter evenings. You will find something else to
				   do, besides going about from house to house, spending one hour after
				   another in unprofitable conversation, or, at best, to no other purpose
				   but to amuse yourselves, to fill up and wear away your time. And it is
				   to be feared that very much of the time that is spent in our winter
				   evening visits, is spent to a much worse purpose than that which I have
				   now mentioned. Solomon tells us, Prov. 10:19, "That in the multitude of
				   words, there wanteth not sin." And is not this verified in those who
				   find nothing else to do for so great a part of the winter, but to go to
				   one another's houses, and spend the time in such talk as comes next, or
				   such as any one's present disposition happens to suggest? Some
				   diversion is doubtless lawful; but for Christians to spend so much of
				   their time, so many long evenings, in no other conversation than that
				   which tends to divert and amuse, if nothing worse, is a sinful way of
				   spending time, and tends to poverty of soul at least, if not to outward
				   poverty: Prov. 14:23, "In all labor there is profit; but the talk of
				   the lips tendeth only to penury!" Besides, when persons for so much of
				   their time have nothing else to do but to sit, and talk, and chat in
				   one another's chimney corners, there is great danger of falling into
				   foolish and sinful conversation, venting their corrupt dispositions, in
				   talking against others, expressing their jealousies and evil surmises
				   concerning their neighbors; not considering what Christ hath said,
				   Matt. 12:36, "Of every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
				   account in the day of judgment." If you would comply with what you have
				   heard from this doctrine, you would find something else to spend your
				   winters in, one winter after another, besides contention, or talking
				   about those public affairs which tend to contention. Young people might
				   find something else to do, besides spending their time in vain company;
				   something that would be much more profitable to themselves, as it would
				   really turn to some good account; something, in doing which they would
				   both be more out of the devil's way, the way of temptation, and be more
				   in the way of duty, and of a divine blessing. And even aged people
				   would have something to employ themselves in after they are become
				   incapable of bodily labor. Their time, as is now often the case, would
				   not lie heavy upon their hands, as they would, with both profit and
				   pleasure, be engaged in searching the Scriptures, and in comparing and
				   meditating upon the various truths which they should find there.
				
				   2. This would be a noble way of spending your time. The Holy Spirit
				   gives the Bereans this epithet, because they diligently employed
				   themselves in this business: Acts 17:11, "These were more noble than
				   those of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
				   readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those
				   things ere so." This is very much the employment of heaven. The
				   inhabitants of that world spend much of their time in searching into
				   the great things of divinity, and endeavoring to acquire knowledge in
				   them, as we are told of the angels, 1 Pet. 1:12, "Which things the
				   angels desire to look into." This will be very agreeable to what you
				   hope will be your business to all eternity, as you doubtless hope to
				   join in the same employment with the angels of light. Solomon says,
				   Prov. 25:2, "It is the honor of kings to search out a matter;" and
				   certainly, above all others, to search out divine matters. Now if this
				   be the honor even of kings, is it not equally, if not much more, your
				   honor?
				
				   3. This is a pleasant way of improving time. Knowledge is pleasant and
				   delightful to intelligent creatures, and above all the knowledge of
				   divine things; for in them are the most excellent truths, and the most
				   beautiful and amiable objects held forth to view. However tedious the
				   labor necessarily attending this business may be, yet the knowledge
				   once obtained will richly requite the pains taken to obtain it. "When
				   wisdom entereth the heart, knowledge is pleasant to the soul," Prov.
				   2:10.
				
				   4. This knowledge is exceeding useful in Christian practice. Such as
				   have much knowledge in divinity have great means and advantages for
				   spiritual and saving knowledge; for no means of grace, as was said
				   before, have their effect on the heart, otherwise than by the knowledge
				   they impart. The more you have of a rational knowledge of the things of
				   the gospel, the more opportunity will there be, when the Spirit shall
				   be breathed into your heart, to see the excellency of these things, and
				   to taste the sweetness of them. The Heathens, who have no rational
				   knowledge of the things of the gospel, have no opportunity to see the
				   excellency of them; and therefore the more rational knowledge of these
				   things you have, the more opportunity and advantage you have to see the
				   divine excellency and glory of them.
				
				   Again, The more knowledge you have of divine things, the better will
				   you know your duty; your knowledge will be of great use to direct you
				   as to your duty in particular cases. You will also be the better
				   furnished against the temptations of the devil. For the devil often
				   takes the advantage of persons' ignorance to ply them with temptations
				   which otherwise would have no hold of them. By having much knowledge,
				   you will be under greater advantages to conduct yourselves with
				   prudence and discretion in your Christian course, and so to live much
				   more to the honor of God and religion. Many who mean well, and are full
				   of a good spirit, yet, for want of prudence, conduct themselves so as
				   to wound religion. Many have a zeal of God, which doth more hurt than
				   good, because it is not according to knowledge, Rom. 10:2. The reason
				   why many good men behave no better in many instances, is not so much
				   that they want grace, as that they want knowledge.
				
				   Besides, an increase of knowledge would be a great help to profitable
				   conversation. It would supply you with matter for conversation when you
				   come together, or when you visit your neighbors: and so you would have
				   less temptation to spend the time in such conversation as tends to your
				   own and others' hurt.
				
				   5. Consider the advantages you are under to grow in the knowledge of
				   divinity. We are under far greater advantages to gain much knowledge in
				   divinity now, than God's people under the Old Testament, both because
				   the canon of Scripture is so much enlarged since that time, and also
				   because evangelical truths are now so much more plainly revealed. So
				   that common men are now in some respects under advantages to know more
				   of divinity, than the greatest prophets were then. Thus that saying of
				   Christ is in a sense applicable to us, Luke 10:23,24, "Blessed are the
				   eyes which see the things which ye see. For I tell you, that many
				   prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and
				   have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have
				   not heard them." We are in some respects under far greater advantages
				   for gaining knowledge, now in these latter ages of the church, than
				   Christians were formerly; especially by reason of the art of printing,
				   of which God hath given us the benefit, whereby Bibles and other books
				   of divinity are exceedingly multiplied, and persons may now be
				   furnished with helps for the obtaining of Christian knowledge, at a
				   much easier and cheaper rate than they formerly could.
				
				   6. We know not what opposition we may meet with in the principles which
				   we hold in divinity. We know that there are many adversaries to the
				   gospel and its truths. if therefore we embrace those truths, we must
				   expect to be attacked by the said adversaries; and unless we be well
				   informed concerning divine things, how shall we be able to defend
				   ourselves? Besides, the Apostle Peter enjoins it upon us, always to be
				   ready to give an answer to every man who asketh us a reason of the hope
				   that is in us. But this we cannot expect to do without a considerable
				   knowledge in divine things.
				
				   I shall now conclude my discourse with some directions for the
				   acquisition of this knowledge.
				
				   1. Be assiduous in reading the holy Scriptures. This is the fountain
				   whence all knowledge in divinity must be derived. Therefore let not
				   this treasure lie by you neglected. Every man of common understanding
				   who can read, may, if he please, become well acquainted with the
				   Scriptures. And what an excellent attainment would this be!
				
				   2. Content not yourselves with only a cursory reading, without
				   regarding the sense. This is an ill way of reading, to which, however,
				   many accustom themselves all their days. When you read, observe what
				   you read. Observe how things come in. Take notice of the drift of the
				   discourse, and compare one Scripture with another. For the Scripture,
				   by the harmony of the different parts of it, casts great light upon
				   itself. We are expressly directed by Christ to search the Scriptures,
				   which evidently intends something more than a mere cursory reading. And
				   use means to find out the meaning of the Scripture. When you have it
				   explained in the preaching of the word, take notice of it; and if at
				   any time a Scripture that you did not understand be cleared up to your
				   satisfaction, mark it, lay it up, and if possible remember it.
				
				   3. Procure, and diligently use other books which may help you to grow
				   in this knowledge. There are many excellent books extant, which might
				   greatly forward you in this knowledge, and afford you a very profitable
				   and pleasant entertainment in your leisure hours. There is doubtless a
				   great defect in many, that through a lothness to be at a little
				   expense, they furnish themselves with no more helps of this nature.
				   They have a few books indeed, which now and then on Sabbath days they
				   read; but they have had them so long, and read them so often, that they
				   are weary of them, and it is now become a dull story, a mere task to
				   read them.
				
				   4. Improve conversation with others to this end. How much might persons
				   promote each other's knowledge in divine things, if they would improve
				   conversation as they might; if men that are ignorant were not ashamed
				   to show their ignorance, and were willing to learn of others; if those
				   that have knowledge would communicate it, without pride and
				   ostentation; and if all were more disposed to enter on such
				   conversation as would be for their mutual edification and instruction.
				
				   5. Seek not to grow in knowledge chiefly for the sake of applause, and
				   to enable you to dispute with others; but seek it for the benefit of
				   your souls, and in order to practice. If applause be your end, you will
				   not be so likely to be led to the knowledge of the truth, but may
				   justly, as often is the case of those who are proud of their knowledge,
				   be led into error to your own perdition. This being your end, if you
				   should obtain much rational knowledge, it would not be likely to be of
				   any benefit to you, but would puff you up with pride: 1 Cor. 8:1,
				   "Knowledge puffeth up."
				
				   6. Seek to God, that he would direct you, and bless you, in this
				   pursuit after knowledge. This is the apostle's direction, James 1:5:
				   "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all
				   liberally, and upbraideth not." God is the fountain of all divine
				   knowledge. Prov. 2:6, "The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh
				   knowledge and understanding." Labor to be sensible of your own
				   blindness and ignorance, and your need of the help of God, lest you be
				   led into error, instead of true knowledge. 1 Cor. 3:18, "If any man
				   would be wise, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
				
				   8. (sic) Practice according to what knowledge you have. This will be
				   the way to know more. The Psalmist warmly recommends this way of
				   seeking knowledge in divinity, from his own experience: Psalm 119:100,
				   "I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts."
				   Christ also recommends the same: John 7:17, "If any man will do his
				   will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I
				   speak of myself."

				  a Sermon by Jonathan Edwards
				
				    "And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the
				    tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to
				    loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the

				  Introduction
				
				   The visions and revelations the apostle John had of the future events
				   of God's providence, are here introduced with a vision of the book of
				   God's decrees, by which those events were fore-ordained. This is
				   represented (Revelation 5:1) as a book in the right hand of him who sat
				   on the throne, "written within and on the back side, and sealed with
				   seven seals." Books, in the form in which they were wont of old to be
				   made, were broad leaves of parchment or paper, or something of that
				   nature, joined together at one edge, and so rolled up together, and
				   then sealed, or some way fastened together, to prevent their unfolding
				   and opening. Hence we read of the roll of a book Jer. 36:2. It seems to
				   have been such a book that John had a vision of here; and therefore it
				   is said to be "written within and on the back side," i. e. on the
				   inside pages, and also on one of the outside pages, namely, that which
				   it was rolled in, in rolling the book up together. And it is said to be
				   "sealed with seven seals," to signify that what was written in it was
				   perfectly hidden and secret; or that God's decrees of future events are
				   sealed, and shut up from all possibility of being discovered by
				   creatures, till God is pleased to make them known. We find that seven
				   is often used in Scripture as the number of perfection, to signify the
				   superlative or most perfect degree of anything, which probably arose
				   from this, that on the seventh day God beheld the works of creation
				   finished, and rested and rejoiced in them, as being complete and
				   perfect.
				
				   When John saw this book, he tells us, he "saw a strong angel
				   proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to
				   loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither
				   under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon."
				   And that he wept much, because "no man was found worthy to open and
				   read the book, neither to look thereon." And then tells us how his
				   tears were dried up, namely, that "one of the elders said unto him,
				   "Weep not, Behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed" etc.
				   as in the text. Though no man nor angel, nor any mere creature, was
				   found either able to loose the seals, or worthy to be admitted to the
				   privilege of reading the book, yet this was declared, for the comfort
				   of this beloved disciple, that Christ was found both able and worthy.
				   And we have an account in the succeeding chapters how he actually did
				   it, opening the seals in order, first one, and then another, revealing
				   what God had decreed should come to pass hereafter. And we have an
				   account in this chapter, of his coming and taking the book out of the
				   right hand of him that sat on the throne, and of the joyful praises
				   that were sung to him in heaven and earth on that occasion.
				
				   Many things might be observed in the words of the text; but it is to my
				   present purpose only to take notice of the two distinct appellations
				   here given to Christ.
				    1. He is called a Lion. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. He
				       seems to be called the Lion of the tribe of Judah, in allusion to
				       what Jacob said in his blessing of the tribe on his death-bed; who,
				       when he came to bless Judah, compares him to a lion, Gen. 49:9.
				       "Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:
				       he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who
				       shall rouse him up?" And also to the standard of the camp of Judah
				       in the wilderness on which was displayed a lion, according to the
				       ancient tradition of the Jews. It is much on account of the valiant
				       acts of David that the tribe of Judah, of which David was, is in
				       Jacob's prophetical blessing compared to a lion; but more
				       especially with an eye to Jesus Christ, who also was of that tribe,
				       and was descended of David, and is in our text called "the Root of
				       David"; and therefore Christ is here called "the Lion of the tribe
				       of Judah."
				    2. He is called a Lamb. John was told of a Lion that had prevailed to
				       open the book, and probably expected to see a lion in his vision;
				       but while he is expecting, behold a Lamb appears to open the book,
				       an exceeding diverse kind of creature from a lion. A lion is a
				       devourer, one that is wont to make terrible slaughter of others;
				       and no creature more easily falls a prey to him than a lamb. And
				       Christ is here represented not only as a Lamb, a creature very
				       liable to be slain, but a "Lamb as it had been slain," that is,
				       with the marks of its deadly wounds appearing on it.
				
				   That which I would observe from the words, for the subject of my
				   present discourse, is this, namely --
				
				   There is an admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies in Jesus
				   Christ.
				
				   The lion and the lamb, though very diverse kinds of creatures, yet have
				   each their peculiar excellencies. The lion excels in strength, and in
				   the majesty of his appearance and voice: the lamb excels in meekness
				   and patience, besides the excellent nature of the creature as good for
				   food, and yielding that which is fit for our clothing and being
				   suitable to be offered in sacrifice to God. But we see that Christ is
				   in the text compared to both, because the diverse excellencies of both
				   wonderfully meet in him, -- In handling this subject I would
				
				   [42]First, Show wherein there is an admirable conjunction of diverse
				   excellencies in Christ.
				   [43]Second, Show how this admirable conjunction of excellencies appear
				   in Christ's acts.
				   [44]Third, make application.
				
				Part One
				
				   First, I would show wherein there is an admirable conjunction of
				   diverse excellencies in Jesus Christ. which appears in three things:
				
				   [45]A) There is a conjunction of such excellencies in Christ, as, in
				   our manner of conceiving, are very diverse one from another.
				
				   [46]B) There is in him a conjunction of such really diverse
				   excellencies, as otherwise would have seemed to us utterly incompatible
				   in the same subject.
				
				   [47]C) Such diverse excellencies are exercised in him towards men that
				   otherwise would have seemed impossible to be exercised towards the same
				   object.
				
				   A) There is a conjunction of such excellencies in Christ as, in our
				   manner of conceiving, are very diverse one from another. Such are the
				   various divine perfections and excellencies that Christ is possessed
				   of. Christ is a divine person, and therefore has all the attributes of
				   God. The difference between these is chiefly relative, and in our
				   manner of conceiving them. And those which, in this sense, are most
				   diverse, meet in the person of Christ. I shall mention two instances.
				    1. There do meet in Jesus Christ infinite highness and infinite
				       condescension.
				       Christ, as he is God, is infinitely great and high above all. He is
				       higher than the kings of the earth; for he is King of kings, and
				       Lord of lords. He is higher than the heavens, and higher than the
				       highest angels of heaven. So great is he, that all men, all kings
				       and princes, are as worms of the dust before him; all nations are
				       as the drop of the bucket, and the light dust of the balance; yea,
				       and angels themselves are as nothing before him. He is so high,
				       that he is infinitely above any need of us; above our reach, that
				       we cannot be profitable to him; and above our conceptions, that we
				       cannot comprehend him. Prov. 30:4 "What is his name, and what is
				       his Son's name, if thou canst tell?" Our understandings, if we
				       stretch them never so far, cannot reach up to his divine glory. Job
				       11:8 "It is high as heaven, what canst thou do?" Christ is the
				       Creator and great Possessor of heaven and earth. He is sovereign
				       Lord of all. He rules over the whole universe, and doth whatsoever
				       pleaseth him. His knowledge is without bound. His wisdom is
				       perfect, and what none can circumvent. His power is infinite, and
				       none can resist Him. His riches are immense and inexhaustible. His
				       majesty is infinitely awful.
				       And yet he is one of infinite condescension. None are so low or
				       inferior, but Christ's condescension is sufficient to take a
				       gracious notice of them. He condescends not only to the angels,
				       humbling himself to behold the things that are done in heaven, but
				       he also condescends to such poor creatures as men; and that not
				       only so as to take notice of princes and great men, but of those
				       that are of meanest rank and degree, "the poor of the world," James
				       2:5. Such as are commonly despised by their fellow creatures,
				       Christ does not despise. I Cor. 1:28 "Base things of the world, and
				       things that are despised, hath God chosen." Christ condescends to
				       take notice of beggars Luke 16:22 and people of the most despised
				       nations. In Christ Jesus is neither "Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor
				       free" (Col. 3:11). He that is thus high condescends to take a
				       gracious notice of little children Matt. 19:14. "Suffer little
				       children to come unto me." Yea, which is more, his condescension is
				       sufficient to take a gracious notice of the most unworthy, sinful
				       creatures, those that have no good deservings, and those that have
				       infinite ill deservings.
				       Yea, so great is his condescension, that it is not only sufficient
				       to take some gracious notice of such as these, but sufficient for
				       every thing that is an act of condescension. His condescension is
				       great enough to become their friend, to become their companion, to
				       unite their souls to him in spiritual marriage. It is enough to
				       take their nature upon him, to become one of them, that he may be
				       one with them. Yea, it is great enough to abase himself yet lower
				       for them, even to expose himself to shame and spitting; yea, to
				       yield up himself to an ignominious death for them. And what act of
				       condescension can be conceived of greater? Yet such an act as this,
				       has his condescension yielded to, for those that are so low and
				       mean, despicable and unworthy!
				       Such a conjunction of infinite highness and low condescension, in
				       the same person, is admirable. We see, by manifold instances, what
				       a tendency a high station has in men, to make them to be of a quite
				       contrary disposition. If one worm be a little exalted above
				       another, by having more dust, or a bigger dunghill, how much does
				       he make of himself! What a distance does he keep from those that
				       are below him! And a little condescension is what he expects should
				       be made much of, and greatly acknowledged. Christ condescends to
				       wash our feet; but how would great men, (or rather the bigger
				       worms,) account themselves debased by acts of far less
				       condescension!
				    2. There meet in Jesus Christ, infinite justice and infinite grace.
				       As Christ is a divine person, he is infinitely holy and just,
				       hating sin, and disposed to execute condign punishment for sin. He
				       is the Judge of the world, and the infinitely just Judge of it, and
				       will not at all acquit the wicked, or by any means clear the
				       guilty.
				       And yet he is infinitely gracious and merciful. Though his justice
				       be so strict with respect to all sin, and every breach of the law,
				       yet he has grace sufficient for every sinner, and even the chief of
				       sinners. And it is not only sufficient for the most unworthy to
				       show them mercy, and bestow some good upon them, but to bestow the
				       greatest good; yea, it is sufficient to bestow all good upon them,
				       and to do all things for them. There is no benefit or blessing that
				       they can receive, so great but the grace of Christ is sufficient to
				       bestow it on the greatest sinner that ever lived. And not only so,
				       but so great is his grace, that nothing is too much as the means of
				       this good. It is sufficient not only to do great things, but also
				       to suffer in order to do it, and not only to suffer, but to suffer
				       most extremely even unto death, the most terrible of natural evils;
				       and not only death, but the most ignominious and tormenting, and
				       every way the most terrible that men could inflict; yea, and
				       greater sufferings than men could inflict, who could only torment
				       the body. He had sufferings in his soul, that were the more
				       immediate fruits of the wrath of God against the sins of those he
				       undertakes for.
				       B) There do meet in the person of Christ such really diverse
				       excellencies, which otherwise would have been thought utterly
				       incompatible in the same subject; such as are conjoined in no other
				       person whatever, either divine, human, or angelical; and such as
				       neither men nor angels would ever have imagined could have met
				       together in the same person, had it not been seen in the person of
				       Christ. I would give some instances.
				         1. In the person of Christ do meet together infinite glory and
				            lowest humility. Infinite glory, and the virtue of humility,
				            meet in no other person but Christ. They meet in no created
				            person; for no created person has infinite glory, and they
				            meet in no other divine person but Christ. For though the
				            divine nature be infinitely abhorrent to pride, yet humility
				            is not properly predicable of God the Father, and the Holy
				            Ghost, that exist only in the divine nature; because it is a
				            proper excellency only of a created nature; for it consists
				            radically in a sense of a comparative lowness and littleness
				            before God, or the great distance between God and the subject
				            of this virtue; but it would be a contradiction to suppose any
				            such thing in God.
				            But in Jesus Christ, who is both God and man, those two
				            diverse excellencies are sweetly united. He is a person
				            infinitely exalted in glory and dignity. Phil. 2:6. "Being in
				            the form of God, he thought it not robbery to be equal with
				            God." There is equal honor due to him with the Father. John
				            5:23. "That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor
				            the Father." God himself says to him, "thy throne, O God, is
				            for ever and ever," Heb. 1:8. And there is the same supreme
				            respect and divine worship paid to him by the angels of
				            heaven, as to God the Father, ver. 6. "Let all the angels of
				            God worship him."
				            But however he is thus above all, yet he is lowest of all in
				            humility. There never was so great an instance of this virtue
				            among either men or angels, as Jesus. None ever was so
				            sensible of the distance between God and him, or had a heart
				            so lowly before God, as the man Christ Jesus. Matt. 11:29.
				            What a wonderful spirit of humility appeared in him, when he
				            was here upon earth, in all his behavior! In his contentment
				            in his mean outward condition, contentedly living in the
				            family of Joseph the carpenter, and Mary his mother, for
				            thirty years together, and afterwards choosing outward
				            meanness, poverty, and contempt, rather than earthly
				            greatness; in his washing his disciples' feet, and in all his
				            speeches and deportment towards them; in his cheerfully
				            sustaining the form of a servant through his whole life, and
				            submitting to such immense humiliation at death!
				         2. In the person of Christ do meet together infinite majesty and
				            transcendent meekness. These again are two qualifications that
				            meet together in no other person but Christ. Meekness,
				            properly so called, is a virtue proper only to the creature:
				            we scarcely ever find meekness mentioned as a divine attribute
				            in Scripture; at least not in the New Testament; for thereby
				            seems to be signified, a calmness and quietness of spirit,
				            arising from humility in mutable beings that are naturally
				            liable to be put into a ruffle by the assaults of a
				            tempestuous and injurious world. But Christ, being both God
				            and man, hath both infinite majesty and superlative meekness.
				            Christ was a person of infinite majesty. It is he that is
				            spoken of, Psalm 45:3. "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most
				            mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty." It is he that is
				            mighty, that rideth on the heavens, and his excellency on the
				            sky. It is he that is terrible out of his holy places; who is
				            mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty
				            waves of the sea: before whom a fire goeth, and burneth up his
				            enemies round about; at whose presence the earth quakes, and
				            the hills melt; who sitteth on the circle of the earth, and
				            all the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers, who rebukes
				            the sea, and maketh it dry and drieth up the rivers, whose
				            eyes are as a flame of fire, from whose presence, and from the
				            glory of whose power, the wicked shall be punished with
				            everlasting destruction; who is the blessed and only
				            Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who hath
				            heaven for his throne, and the earth for his footstool, and is
				            the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose kingdom is
				            an everlasting kingdom, and of whose dominion there is no end.
				            And yet he was the most marvellous instance of meekness, and
				            humble quietness of spirit, that ever was; agreeable to the
				            prophecies of him, Matthew 21:4f "All this was done, that it
				            might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
				            Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
				            thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
				            ass." And, agreeable to what Christ declares of himself, Matt.
				            11:29. "I am meek and lowly in heart." And agreeable to what
				            was manifest in his behavior: for there never was such an
				            instance seen on earth, of a meek behavior, under injuries and
				            reproaches, and towards enemies; who, when he was reviled,
				            reviled not again. He had a wonderful spirit of forgiveness,
				            was ready to forgive his worst enemies, and prayed for them
				            with fervent and effectual prayers. With what meekness did he
				            appear in the ring of soldiers that were contemning and
				            mocking him; he was silent, and opened not his mouth, but went
				            as a lamb to the slaughter. Thus is Christ a Lion in majesty
				            and a Lamb in meekness.
				         3. There meet in the person of Christ the deepest reverence
				            towards God and equality with God. Christ, when on earth,
				            appeared full of holy reverence towards the Father. He paid
				            the most reverential worship to him, praying to him with
				            postures of reverence. Thus we read of his "kneeling down and
				            praying," Luke 22:41. This became Christ, as one who had taken
				            on him the human nature, but at the same time he existed in
				            the divine nature; whereby his person was in all respects
				            equal to the person of the Father. God the Father hath no
				            attribute or perfection that the Son hath not, in equal
				            degree, and equal glory. These things meet in no other person
				            but Jesus Christ.
				         4. There are conjoined in the person of Christ infinite
				            worthiness of good, and the greatest patience under sufferings
				            of evil.
				            He was perfectly innocent,and deserved no suffering. He
				            deserved nothing from God by any guilt of his own, and he
				            deserved no ill from men. Yea, he was not only harmless and
				            undeserving of suffering, but he was infinitely worthy; worthy
				            of the infinite love of the Father, worthy of infinite and
				            eternal happiness, and infinitely worthy of all possible
				            esteem, love, and service from all men.
				            And yet he was perfectly patient under the greatest sufferings
				            that ever were endured in this world. Heb. 12:2. "He endured
				            the cross, despising the shame." He suffered not from his
				            Father for his faults, but ours; and he suffered from men not
				            for his faults but for those things on account of which he was
				            infinitely worthy of their love and honor, which made his
				            patience the more wonderful and the more glorious. 1 Pet.
				            2:20, "For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your
				            faults, ye shall take it patiently, but if when ye do well.
				            and suffer for it, ye take it patiently; this is acceptable
				            with God. For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ
				            also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should
				            follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in
				            his mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he
				            suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that
				            judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our sins in his own
				            body on the tree, that we being dead to sin, should live unto
				            righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed." There is no
				            such conjunction of innocence, worthiness, and patience under
				            sufferings, as in the person of Christ.
				         5. In the person of Christ are conjoined an exceeding spirit of
				            obedience, with supreme dominion over heaven and earth.
				            Christ is the Lord of all things in two respects: he is so, as
				            God-man and Mediator, and thus his dominion is appointed, and
				            given him of the Father. Having it by delegation from God, he
				            is as it were the Father's vicegerent. But he is Lord of all
				            things in another respect, namely, as he is (by his original
				            nature) God; and so he is by natural right the Lord of all,
				            and supreme over all as much as the Father. Thus, he has
				            dominion over the world, not by delegation, but in his own
				            right. He is not an under God, as the Arians suppose, but to
				            all intents and purposes supreme God.
				            And yet in the same person is found the greatest spirit of
				            obedience to the commands and laws of God that ever was in the
				            universe; which was manifest in his obedience here in this
				            world. John 14:31 "As the Father gave me commandment, even so
				            I do."-- John 15:10. "Even as I have kept my Father's
				            commandments, and abide in his love." The greatness of his
				            obedience appears in its perfection, and in his obeying
				            commands of such exceeding difficulty. Never any one received
				            commands from God of such difficulty, and that were so great a
				            trial of obedience, as Jesus Christ. One of God's commands to
				            him was, that he should yield himself to those dreadful
				            sufferings that he underwent. See John 10:18. "No man taketh
				            it from me, but I lay it down of myself." "This commandment
				            received I of my Father." And Christ was thoroughly obedient
				            to this command of God. Heb. 5:8. "Though he were a Son, yet
				            he learned obedience by the things that he suffered." Philip.
				            2:8. "He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even
				            the death of the cross." Never was there such an instance of
				            obedience in man or angel as this, though he was at the same
				            time supreme Lord of both angels and men.
				         6. In the person of Christ are conjoined absolute sovereignty and
				            perfect resignation. This is another unparalleled conjunction.
				            Christ, as he is God, is the absolute sovereign of the world,
				            the sovereign disposer of all events. The decrees of God are
				            all his sovereign decrees; and the work of creation, and all
				            God's works of providence, are his sovereign works. It is he
				            that worketh all things according to the counsel of his own
				            will. Col 1:16f. "By him, and through him, and to him, are all
				            things." John 5:17. "The Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
				            Matt. 8:3. "I will, be thou clean."
				            But yet Christ was the most wonderful instance of resignation
				            that ever appeared in the world. He was absolutely and
				            perfectly resigned when he had a near and immediate prospect
				            of his terrible sufferings, and the dreadful cup that he was
				            to drink. The idea and expectation of this made his soul
				            exceeding sorrowful even unto death, and put him into such an
				            agony, that his sweat was as it were great drops or clots of
				            blood, falling down to the ground. But in such circumstances
				            he was wholly resigned to the will of God. Matt 26:39. "O my
				            Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
				            nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt". Verse 42. "O
				            my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink
				            it, thy will be done."
				         7. In Christ do meet together self-sufficiency, and an entire
				            trust and reliance on God, which is another conjunction
				            peculiar to the person of Christ.
				            As he is a divine person, he is self-sufficient, standing in
				            need of nothing. All creatures are dependent on him, but he is
				            dependent on none, but is absolutely independent. His
				            proceeding from the Father, in his eternal generation, argues
				            no proper dependence on the will of the Father; for that
				            proceeding was natural and necessary, and not arbitrary.
				            But yet Christ entirely trusted in God: -- his enemies say
				            that of him, "He trusted in God that he would deliver him,"
				            Matt. 27:43. And the apostle testifies, I Pet. 2:23. "That he
				            committed himself God."
				       C) Such diverse excellencies are expressed in him towards men, that
				       otherwise would have seemed impossible to be exercised towards the
				       same object; as particularly these three, justice, mercy, and
				       truth. The same that are mentioned in Psalm 85:10. "Mercy and truth
				       are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other."
				       The strict justice of God, and even his revenging justice, and that
				       against the sins of men, never was so gloriously manifested. as in
				       Christ. He manifested an infinite regard to the attribute of God's
				       justice, in that, when he had a mind to save sinners, he was
				       willing to undergo such extreme sufferings, rather than that their
				       salvation should be to the injury of the honor of that attribute.
				       And as he is the Judge of the world, he doth himself exercise
				       strict justice, he will not clear the guilty, nor at all acquit the
				       wicked in judgment.
				       Yet how wonderfully is infinite mercy towards sinners displayed in
				       him! And what glorious and ineffable grace and love have been and
				       are exercised by him, towards sinful men! Though he be the just
				       Judge of a sinful world, yet he is also the Savior of the world.
				       Though he be a consuming fire to sin, yet he is the light and life
				       of sinners. Rom. 3:25f. "Whom God hath set forth to be a
				       propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his
				       righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
				       forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his
				       righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of him
				       which believeth in Jesus."
				       So the immutable truth of God, in the threatenings of his law
				       against the sins of men, was never so manifested as it is in Jesus
				       Christ, for there never was any other so great a trial of the
				       unalterableness of the truth of God in those threatenings, as when
				       sin came to be imputed to his own Son. And then in Christ has been
				       seen already an actual complete accomplishment of those
				       threatenings, which never has been nor will be seen in any other
				       instance; because the eternity that will be taken up in fulfilling
				       those threatenings on others, never will be finished. Christ
				       manifested an infinite regard to this truth of God in his
				       sufferings. And, in his judging the world, he makes the covenant of
				       works, that contains those dreadful threatenings, his rule of
				       judgement. He will see to it, that it is not infringed in the least
				       jot or tittle: he will do nothing contrary to the threatenings of
				       the law, and their complete fulfilment. And yet in him we have many
				       great and precious promises, promises of perfect deliverance from
				       the penalty of the law. And this is the promise that he hath
				       promised us, even eternal life. And in him are all the promises of
				       God yea, and Amen.
				       Part Two Having thus shown wherein there is an admirable
				       conjunction of excellencies in Jesus Christ, I now proceed,
				       Secondly, To show how this admirable conjunction of excellencies
				       appears in Christ's acts, [ namely:]
				       A) in his taking of human nature,
				       B) in his earthly life,
				       C) in his sacrificial death,
				       D) in his exaltation in heaven,
				       E) in his final subduing of all evil when he returns in glory.]
				       A) It appears in what Christ did in taking on him our nature.
				       In this act, his infinite condescension wonderfully appeared, That
				       he who was God should become man; that the word should be made
				       flesh, and should take on him a nature infinitely below his
				       original nature! And it appears yet more remarkably in the low
				       circumstances of his incarnation: he was conceived in the womb of a
				       poor young woman, whose poverty appeared in this, when she came to
				       offer sacrifices of her purification, she brought what was allowed
				       of in the law only in case of poverty, as Luke 2:24. "According to
				       what Is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two
				       young pigeons." This was allowed only in case the person was so
				       poor that she was not able to offer a lamb. Lev. 12:8.
				       And though his infinite condescension thus appeared in the manner
				       of his incarnation, yet his divine dignity also appeared in it; for
				       though he was conceived in the womb of a poor virgin, yet he was
				       conceived there by the power of the Holy Ghost. And his divine
				       dignity also appeared in the holiness of his conception and birth.
				       Though he was conceived in the womb of one of the corrupt race of
				       mankind, yet he was conceived and born without sin; as the angel
				       said to the blessed Virgin, Luke 1:35. "The Holy Ghost shall come
				       upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee,
				       therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall
				       be called the Son of God."
				       His infinite condescension marvelously appeared in the manner of
				       his birth. He was brought forth in a stable because there was no
				       room for them in the inn. The inn was taken up by others, that were
				       looked upon as persons of greater account. The Blessed Virgin,
				       being poor and despised, was turned or shut out. Though she was in
				       such necessitous circumstances, yet those that counted themselves
				       her betters would not give place to her; and therefore, in the time
				       of her travail, she was forced to betake herself to a stable; and
				       when the child was born, it was wrapped in swaddling clothes, and
				       laid in a manger. There Christ lay a little infant, and there he
				       eminently appeared as a lamb.
				       But yet this feeble infant, born thus in a stable, and laid in a
				       manger, was born to conquer and triumph over Satan, that roaring
				       lion. He came to subdue the mighty powers of darkness, and make a
				       show of them openly, and so to restore peace on earth, and to
				       manifest God's good-will towards men, and to bring glory to God in
				       the highest, according as the end of his birth was declared by the
				       joyful songs of the glorious hosts of angels appearing to the
				       shepherds at the same time that the infant lay in the manger;
				       whereby his divine dignity was manifested.
				       B) This admirable conjunction of excellencies appears in the acts
				       and various passages of Christ's life.
				       Though Christ dwelt in mean outward circumstances, whereby his
				       condescension and humility especially appeared, and his majesty was
				       veiled; yet his divine divinity and glory did in many of his acts
				       shine through the veil, and it illustriously appeared, that he was
				       not only the Son of man, but the great God.
				       Thus, in the circumstances of his infancy, his outward meanness
				       appeared; yet there was something then to show forth his divine
				       dignity, in the wise men's being stirred up to come from the east
				       to give honor to him their being led by a miraculous star, and
				       coming and falling down and worshipping him, and presenting him
				       with gold, frankincense, and myrrh. His humility and meekness
				       wonderfully appeared in his subjection to his mother and reputed
				       father when he was a child. Herein he appeared as a lamb. But his
				       divine glory broke forth and shone when, at twelve years old, he
				       disputed with doctors in the temple. In that he appeared, in some
				       measure, as the Lion of the tribe of Judah.
				       And so, after he entered on his public ministry, his marvellous
				       humility and meekness was manifested in his choosing to appear in
				       such mean outward circumstances; and in being contented in them,
				       when he was so poor that he had not where to lay his head, and
				       depended on the charity of some of his followers for his
				       subsistence, as appears by Luke 8. at the beginning. How meek,
				       condescending, and familiar his treatment of his disciples; his
				       discourses with them, treating them as a father his children, yea,
				       as friends and companions. How patient, bearing such affliction and
				       reproach, and so many injuries from the scribes and Pharisees, and
				       others. In these things he appeared as a Lamb.
				       And yet he at the same time did in many ways show forth his divine
				       majesty and glory, particularly in the miracles he wrought, which
				       were evidently divine works, and manifested omnipotent power, and
				       so declared him to be the Lion of the tribe of Judah. His wonderful
				       and miraculous works plainly showed him to be the God of nature; in
				       that it appeared by them that he had all nature in his hands, and
				       could lay an arrest upon it, and stop and change its course as he
				       pleased. In healing the sick, and opening the eyes of the blind,
				       and unstopping the ears of the deaf, and healing the lame, he
				       showed that he was the God that framed the eye, and created the
				       ear, and was the author of the frame of man's body. By the dead's
				       rising at his command, it appeared that he was the author and
				       fountain of life, and that "God the Lord, to whom belong the issues
				       from death." By his walking on the sea in a storm, when the waves
				       were raised, he showed himself to be that God spoken of in Job 9:8.
				       "That treadeth on the waves of the sea." By his stilling the storm,
				       and calming the rage of the sea, by his powerful command, saying,
				       "Peace, be still," he showed that he has the command of the
				       universe, and that he is that God who brings things to pass by the
				       word of his power, who speaks and it is done, who commands and it
				       stands fast; Psalm 115:7. "Who stilleth the noise of the seas, the
				       noise of their waves." And Psalm 107:29. "That maketh the storm a
				       calm, so that the waves thereof are still." And Psalm 139:8f. "O
				       Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee, or to thy
				       faithfulness round about thee? Thou rulest the raging of the sea:
				       when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them." Christ, by
				       casting out devils, remarkably appeared as the Lion of the tribe of
				       Judah, and showed that he was stronger than the roaring lion, that
				       seizes whom he may devour. He commanded them to come out, and they
				       were forced to obey. They were terribly afraid of him; they fall
				       down before him, and beseech him not so torment them. He forces a
				       whole legion of them to forsake their hold, by his powerful word;
				       and they could not so much as enter into the swine without his
				       leave. He showed the glory of his omniscience, by telling the
				       thoughts of men; as we have often an account. Herein he appeared to
				       be that God spoken of, Amos 4:13. "That declareth unto man what is
				       his thought." Thus, in the midst of his meanness and humiliation,
				       his divine glory appeared in his miracles, John 2:11. "This
				       beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested
				       forth his glory."
				       And though Christ ordinarily appeared without outward glory, and in
				       great obscurity, yet at a certain time he threw off the veil, and
				       appeared in his divine majesty, so far as it could be outwardly
				       manifested to men in this frail state, when he was transfigured in
				       the mount. The apostle Peter, 2 Pet. 1:16,17. was an "eye-witness
				       of his majesty, when he received from God the Father honor and
				       glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent
				       glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; which
				       voice that came from heaven they heard, when they were with him in
				       the holy mount."
				       And at the same time that Christ was wont to appear in such
				       meekness, condescension, and humility, in his familiar discourses
				       with his disciples, appearing therein as the Lamb of God; he was
				       also wont to appear as The Lion of the tribe of Judah, with divine
				       authority and majesty, in his so sharply rebuking the scribes and
				       Pharisees, and other hypocrites.
				       C) This admirable conjunction of excellencies remarkably appears in
				       his offering up himself a sacrifice for sinners in his last
				       sufferings.
				       As this was the greatest thing in all the works of redemption, the
				       greatest act of Christ in that work; so in this act especially does
				       there appear that admirable conjunction of excellencies that has
				       been spoken of. Christ never so much appeared as a lamb, as when he
				       was slain: "He came like a lamb to the slaughter," Isaiah 53:7.
				       Then he was offered up to God as a lamb without blemish, and
				       without spot: then especially did he appear to be the anti-type of
				       the lamb of the passover: 1 Cor 5:7. "Christ our Passover
				       sacrificed for us." And yet in that act he did in an especial
				       manner appear as the Lion of the tribe of Judah; yea, in this above
				       all other acts, in many respects, as may appear in the following
				       things.
				         1. Then was Christ in the greatest degree of his humiliation, and
				            yet by that, above all other things, his divine glory appears.
				            Christ's humiliation was great, in being born in such a low
				            condition, of a poor virgin, and in a stable. His humiliation
				            was great, in being subject to Joseph the carpenter, and Mary
				            his mother, and afterwards living in poverty, so as not to
				            have where to lay his head; and in suffering such manifold and
				            bitter reproaches as he suffered, while he went about
				            preaching and working miracles. But his humiliation was never
				            so great as it was, in his last sufferings, beginning with his
				            agony in the garden, till he expired on the cross. Never was
				            he subject to such ignominy as then, never did he suffer so
				            much pain in his body, or so much sorrow in his soul; never
				            was he in so great an exercise of his condescension, humility,
				            meekness, and patience, as he was in these last sufferings;
				            never was his divine glory and majesty covered with so thick
				            and dark a veil; never did he so empty himself and make
				            himself of no reputation, as at this time.
				            And yet, never was his divine glory so manifested, by any act
				            of his, as in yielding himself up to these sufferings. When
				            the fruit of it came to appear, and the mystery and ends of it
				            to be unfolded in its issue, then did the glory of it appear,
				            then did it appear as the most glorious act of Christ that
				            ever he exercised towards the creature. This act of his is
				            celebrated by the angels and hosts of heaven with peculiar
				            praises, as that which is above all others glorious, as you
				            may see in the context, (Revelation 5:9-12) "And they sang a
				            new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to
				            open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain and hast redeemed
				            us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and
				            people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and
				            priests: and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld, and I
				            heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the
				            beasts, and the elders: and the number of them was ten
				            thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,
				            saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to
				            receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
				            honor, and glory, and blessing."
				         2. He never in any act gave so great a manifestation of love to
				            God, and yet never so manifested his love to those that were
				            enemies to God, as in that act.
				            Christ never did any thing whereby his love to the Father was
				            so eminently manifested, as in his laying down his life, under
				            such inexpressible sufferings, in obedience to his command and
				            for the vindication of the honor of his authority and majesty;
				            nor did ever any mere creature give such a testimony of love
				            to God as that was.
				            And yet this was the greatest expression of his love to sinful
				            men who were enemies to God; Rom. 5:10. "When we were enemies,
				            we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son." The
				            greatness of Christ's love to such, appears in nothing so much
				            as in its being dying love. That blood of Christ which fell in
				            great drops to the ground, in his agony, was shed from love to
				            God's enemies, and his own. That shame and spitting, that
				            torment of body, and that exceeding sorrow, even unto death,
				            which he endured in his soul, was what he underwent from love
				            to rebels against God to save them from hell, and to purchase
				            for them eternal glory. Never did Christ so eminently show his
				            regard to God's honor, as in offering up himself a victim to
				            Justice. And yet in this above all, he manifested his love to
				            them who dishonored God, so as to bring such guilt on
				            themselves, that nothing less than his blood could atone for
				            it.
				         3. Christ never so eminently appeared for divine justice, and yet
				            never suffered so much from divine Justice, as when he offered
				            up himself a sacrifice for our sins.
				            In Christ's great sufferings did his infinite regard to the
				            honor of God's justice distinguishingly appear, for it was
				            from regard to that that he thus humbled himself.
				            And yet in these sufferings, Christ was the target of the
				            vindictive expressions of that very justice of God. Revenging
				            justice then spent all its force upon him, on account of our
				            guilt; which made him sweat blood, and cry out upon the cross,
				            and probably rent his vitals--broke his heart, the fountain of
				            blood, or some other blood vessels--and by the violent
				            fermentation turned his blood to water. For the blood and
				            water that issued out of his side, when pierced by the spear,
				            seems to have been extravasated blood, and so there might be a
				            kind of literal fulfilment of Psalm 22:14. "I am poured out
				            like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is
				            like wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels." And this
				            was the way and means by which Christ stood up for the honor
				            of God's justice, namely, by thus suffering its terrible
				            executions. For when he had undertaken for sinners, and had
				            substituted himself in their room, divine justice could have
				            its due honor no other way than by his suffering its revenges.
				            In this the diverse excellencies that met in the person of
				            Christ appeared, namely, his infinite regard to God's justice,
				            and such love to those that have exposed themselves to it, as
				            induced him thus to yield himself a sacrifice to it.
				         4. Christ's holiness never so illustriously shone forth as it did
				            in his last sufferings, and yet he never was to such a degree
				            treated as guilty.
				            Christ's holiness never had such a trial as it had then, and
				            therefore never had so great a manifestation. When it was
				            tried in this furnace it came forth as gold, or as silver
				            purified seven times. His holiness then above all appeared in
				            his steadfast pursuit of the honor of God, and in his
				            obedience to him. For his yielding himself unto death was
				            transcendently the greatest act of obedience that ever was
				            paid to God by any one since the foundation of the world.
				            And yet then Christ was in the greatest degree treated as a
				            wicked person would have been. He was apprehended and bound as
				            a malefactor. His accusers represented him as a most wicked
				            wretch. In his sufferings before his crucifixion, he was
				            treated as if he had been the worst and vilest of mankind, and
				            then, he was put to a kind of death, that none but the worst
				            sort of malefactors were wont to suffer, those that were most
				            abject in their persons, and guilty of the blackest crimes.
				            And he suffered as though guilty from God himself, by reason
				            of our guilt imputed to him; for he who knew no sin, was made
				            sin for us; he was made subject to wrath, as if he had been
				            sinful himself. He was made a curse for us.
				            Christ never so greatly manifested his hatred of sin, as
				            against God, as in his dying to take away the dishonor that
				            sin had done to God; and yet never was he to such a degree
				            subject to the terrible effects of God's hatred of sin, and
				            wrath against it, as he was then. in this appears those
				            diverse excellencies meeting in Christ, namely, love to God,
				            and grace to sinners.
				         5. He never was so dealt with, as unworthy, as in his last
				            sufferings, and yet it is chiefly on account of them that he
				            is accounted worthy.
				            He was therein dealt with as if he had not been worthy to
				            live: they cry out, "Away with him! away with him! Crucify
				            him." John 19:15. And they prefer Barabbas before him. And he
				            suffered from the Father, as one whose demerits were infinite,
				            by reason of our demerits that were laid upon him.
				            And yet it was especially by that act of his subjecting
				            himself to those sufferings that he merited, and on the
				            account of which chiefly he was accounted worthy of the glory
				            of his exaltation. Philip. 2:8, 9. "He humbled himself, and
				            became obedient unto death; wherefore God hath highly exalted
				            him." And we see that it is on this account chiefly, that he
				            is extolled as worthy by saints and angels in the context:
				            "Worthy," say they, "is the Lamb that was slain." This shows
				            an admirable conjunction in him of infinite dignity, and
				            infinite condescension and love to the infinitely unworthy.
				         6. Christ in his last sufferings suffered most extremely from
				            those towards whom he was then manifesting his greatest act of
				            love.
				            He never suffered so much from his Father, (though not from
				            any hatred to him, but from hatred to our sins,) for he then
				            forsook him, or took away the comforts of his presence; and
				            then "it pleased the Lord to bruise him, and put him to
				            grief." as Isaiah 53:10. And yet he never gave so great a
				            manifestation of love to God as then, as has been already
				            observed.
				            So Christ never suffered so much from the hands of men as he
				            did then; and yet never was in so high an exercise of love to
				            men. He never was so ill treated by his disciples; who were so
				            unconcerned about his sufferings, that they .would not watch
				            with him one hour, in his agony; and when he was apprehended,
				            all forsook him and fled, except Peter, who denied him with
				            oaths and curses. And yet then he was suffering, shedding his
				            blood, and pouring out his soul unto death for them. Yea, he
				            probably was then shedding his blood for some of them that
				            shed his blood, for whom he prayed while they were crucifying
				            him; and who were probably afterwards brought home to Christ
				            by Peter's preaching. (Compare Luke 23:34. Acts 2:23,36,37,41.
				            and chap. 3:17. and chap. 4.) This shows an admirable meeting
				            of justice and grace in the redemption of Christ.
				         7. It was in Christ's last sufferings, above all, that he was
				            delivered up to the power of his enemies; and yet by these,
				            above all, he obtained victory over his enemies.
				            Christ never was so in his enemies' hands, as in the time of
				            his last sufferings. They sought his life before; but from
				            time to time they were restrained, and Christ escaped out of
				            their hands, and this reason is given for it, that his time
				            was not yet come. But now they were suffered to work their
				            will upon him, he was in a great degree delivered up to the
				            malice and cruelty of both wicked men and devils. And
				            therefore when Christ's enemies came to apprehend him, he says
				            to them, Luke 22:53. "When I was daily with you in the temple
				            ye stretched forth no hand against me: but this is your hour,
				            and the power of darkness."
				            And yet it was principally by means of those sufferings that
				            he conquered and overthrew his enemies. Christ never so
				            effectually bruised Satan's head, as when Satan bruised his
				            heel. The weapon with which Christ warred against the devil,
				            and obtained a most complete victory and glorious triumph over
				            him, was the cross, the instrument and weapon with which he
				            thought he had overthrown Christ, and brought on him shameful
				            destruction. Col. 2:14,15. "Blotting out the handwriting of
				            ordinances,--nailing it to his cross: and having spoiled
				            principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly,
				            triumphing over them in it." In his last sufferings, Christ
				            sapped the very foundations of Satan's kingdom, he conquered
				            his enemies in their own territories, and beat them with their
				            own weapons as David cut off Goliath's head with his own
				            sword. The devil had, as it were, swallowed up Christ, as the
				            whale did Jonah-- but it was deadly poison to him, he gave him
				            a mortal wound in his own bowels. He was soon sick of his
				            morsel, and was forced to do by him as the whale did by Jonah.
				            To this day he is heart-sick of what he then swallowed as his
				            prey. In those sufferings of Christ was laid the foundation of
				            all that glorious victory he has already obtained over Satan,
				            in the overthrow of his heathenish kingdom in the Roman
				            empire, and all the success the gospel has had since; and also
				            of all his future and still more glorious victory that is to
				            be obtained in the earth. Thus Samson's riddle is most
				            eminently fulfilled, Judges 14:14. "Out of the eater came
				            forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness." And
				            thus the true Samson does more towards the destruction of his
				            enemies at his death than in his life, in yielding up himself
				            to death, he pulls down the temple of Dagon, and destroys many
				            thousands of his enemies, even while they are making
				            themselves sport in his sufferings--and so he whose type was
				            the ark, pulls down Dagon, and breaks off his head and hands
				            in his own temple, even while he is brought in there as
				            Dagon's captive. (1 Samuel 5:1-4)
				            Thus Christ appeared at the same time, and in the same act, as
				            both a lion and a lamb. He appeared as a lamb in the hands of
				            his cruel enemies; as a lamb in the paws, and between the
				            devouring jaws, of a roaring lion; yea, he was a lamb actually
				            slain by this lion: and yet at the same time, as the Lion of
				            the tribe of Judah, he conquers and triumphs over Satan;
				            destroying his own destroyer; as Samson did the lion that
				            roared upon him, when he rent him as he would a kid. And in
				            nothing has Christ appeared so much as a lion, in glorious
				            strength destroying his enemies, as when he was brought as a
				            lamb to the slaughter. In his greatest weakness he was most
				            strong; and when he suffered most from his enemies, he brought
				            the greatest confusion on his enemies.
				            Thus this admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies was
				            manifest in Christ, in his offering up himself to God in his
				            last sufferings.
				            D) It is still manifest in his acts, in his present state of
				            exaltation in heaven. Indeed, in his exalted state, he most
				            eminently appears in manifestation of those excellencies, on
				            the account of which he is compared to a lion; but still he
				            appears as a lamb; Rev. 14:1. "And I looked, and lo, a Lamb
				            stood on mount Sion"; as in his state of humiliation he
				            chiefly appeared as a lamb, and yet did not appear without
				            manifestation of his divine majesty and power, as the Lion of
				            the tribe of Judah. Though Christ be now at the right-hand of
				            God, exalted as King of heaven, and Lord of the universe; yet
				            as he still is in the human nature, he still excels in
				            humility. Though the man Christ Jesus be the highest of all
				            creatures in heaven, yet he as much excels them all in
				            humility as he doth in glory and dignity, for none sees so
				            much of the distance between God and him as he does. And
				            though he now appears in such glorious majesty and dominion in
				            heaven, yet he appears as a lamb in his condescending, mild,
				            and sweet treatment of his saints there, for he is a Lamb
				            still, even amidst the throne of his exaltation, and he that
				            is the Shepherd of the whole flock is himself a Lamb, and goes
				            before them in heaven as such. Rev. 7:17. "For the Lamb, which
				            is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead
				            them unto living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away
				            all tears from their eyes." Though in heaven every knee bows
				            to him, and though the angels fall down before him adoring
				            him, yet he treats his saints with infinite condescension,
				            mildness, and endearment. And in his acts towards the saints
				            on earth, he still appears as a lamb, manifesting exceeding
				            love and tenderness in his intercession for them, as one that
				            has had experience of affliction and temptation. He has not
				            forgot what these things are, nor has he forgot how to pity
				            those that are subject to them. And he still manifests his
				            lamb-like excellencies, in his dealings with his saints on
				            earth, in admirable forbearance, love, gentleness, and
				            compassion. Behold him instructing, supplying, supporting, and
				            comforting them; often coming to them, and manifesting himself
				            to them by his Spirit, that he may sup with them, and they
				            with him. Behold him admitting them to sweet communion,
				            enabling them with boldness and confidence to come to him, and
				            solacing their hearts. And in heaven Christ still appears, as
				            it were, with the marks of his wounds upon him, and so appears
				            as a Lamb as it had been slain, as he was represented in
				            vision to St John, in the text, when he appeared to open the
				            book sealed with seven seals, which is part of the glory of
				            his exaltation.
				            E) And lastly, this admirable conjunction of excellencies will
				            be manifest in Christ's acts at the last judgement.
				            He then, above all other times, will appear as the Lion of the
				            tribe of Judah in infinite greatness and majesty, when he
				            shall come in the glory of his Father, with all the holy
				            angels, and the earth shall tremble before him, and the hills
				            shall melt. This is he (Rev. 20:11.) "that shall sit on a
				            great white throne, before whose face the earth and heaven
				            shall flee away." He will then appear in the most dreadful and
				            amazing manner to the wicked. The devils tremble at the
				            thought of that appearance, and when it shall be, the kings,
				            and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains.
				            and the mighty men, and every bond-man and every free-man,
				            shall hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the
				            mountains, and shall cry to the mountains and rocks to fall on
				            them, to hide them from the face and wrath of the Lamb. And
				            none can declare or conceive of the amazing manifestations of
				            wrath in which he will then appear towards these, or the
				            trembling and astonishment the shrieking and gnashing of
				            teeth, with which they shall stand before his judgment-seat,
				            and receive the terrible sentence of his wrath.
				            And yet he will at the same time appear as a Lamb to his
				            saints; he will receive them as friends and brethren, treating
				            them with infinite mildness and love. There shall be nothing
				            in him terrible to them, but towards them he will clothe
				            himself wholly with sweetness and endearment. The church shall
				            be then admitted to him as his bride; that shall be her
				            wedding-day. The saints shall all be sweetly invited to come
				            with him to inherit the kingdom, and reign in it with him to
				            all eternity.
				            Part Three [I would now show how the aforesaid teaching is of
				            benefit to us, in that
				            A) it gives us insight into the names of Christ in Scripture,
				            B) it encourages us to accept him as our Savior,
				            C) it encourages us to accept him as our Friend.]
				            A) From this doctrine we may learn one reason why Christ is
				            called by such a variety of names, and held forth under such a
				            variety of representations, in Scripture. It is the better to
				            signify and exhibit to us that variety of excellencies that
				            meet together and are conjoined in him. Many appellations are
				            mentioned together in one verse Isaiah 9:6. "For unto us a
				            Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government
				            shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
				            Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father,
				            the Prince of Peace." It shows a wonderful conjunction of
				            excellencies, that the same person should be a Son, born and
				            given, and yet be the everlasting Father, without beginning or
				            end, that he should be a Child, and yet be he whose name is
				            Counsellor, and the mighty God; and well may his name, in whom
				            such things are conjoined, be called wonderful.
				            By reason of the same wonderful conjunction, Christ is
				            represented by a great variety of sensible things, that are on
				            some account excellent. Thus in some places he is called a
				            Sun, as Mal. 4:2, in others a Star, Numb. 24:17. And he is
				            especially represented by the Morning star, as being that
				            which excels all other stars in brightness, and is the
				            forerunner of the day, Rev. 22:16. And, as in our text, he is
				            compared to a lion in one verse, and a lamb in the next, so
				            sometimes he is compared to a roe or young hart, another
				            creature most diverse from a lion. So in some places he is
				            called a rock, in others he is compared to a pearl. In some
				            places he is called a man of war, and the Captain of our
				            Salvation, in other places he is represented as a bridegroom.
				            In the second chapter of Canticles, the first verse, he is
				            compared to a rose and a lily, that are sweet and beautiful
				            flowers; in the next verse but one, he is compared to a tree
				            bearing sweet fruit. In Isaiah 53:2 he is called a Root out of
				            a dry ground; but elsewhere, instead of that, he is called the
				            Tree of Life, that grows (not in a dry or barren ground, but)
				            "in the midst of the paradise of God." Rev. 2:7.
				            B) Let the consideration of this wonderful meeting of diverse
				            excellencies in Christ induce you to accept of him, and close
				            with him as your Savior. As all manner of excellencies meet in
				            him, so there are concurring in him all manner of arguments
				            and motives, to move you to choose him for your Savior, and
				            every thing that tends to encourage poor sinners to come and
				            put their trust in him: his fullness and all-sufficiency as a
				            Savior gloriously appear in that variety of excellencies that
				            has been spoken of.
				            Fallen man is in a state of exceeding great misery, and is
				            helpless in it; he is a poor weak creature, like an infant
				            cast out in its blood in the day that it is born. But Christ
				            is the lion of the tribe of Judah; he is strong, though we are
				            weak; he hath prevailed to do that for us which no creature
				            else could do. Fallen man is a mean despicable creature, a
				            contemptible worm; but Christ, who has undertaken for us, is
				            infinitely honorable and worthy. Fallen man is polluted, but
				            Christ is infinitely holy; fallen man is hateful, but Christ
				            is infinitely lovely; fallen man is the object of God's
				            indignation, but Christ is infinitely dear to him. We have
				            dreadfully provoked God, but Christ has performed that
				            righteousness which is infinitely precious in God's eyes.
				            And here is not only infinite strength and infinite
				            worthiness, but infinite condescension, and love and mercy, as
				            great as power and dignity. If you are a poor, distressed
				            sinner, whose heart is ready to sink for fear that God never
				            will have mercy on you, you need not be afraid to go to
				            Christ, for fear that he is either unable or unwilling to help
				            you. Here is a strong foundation, and an inexhaustible
				            treasure, to answer the necessities of your poor soul, and
				            here is infinite grace and gentleness to invite and embolden a
				            poor, unworthy, fearful soul to come to it. If Christ accepts
				            of you, you need not fear but that you will be safe, for he is
				            a strong Lion for your defense. And if you come, you need not
				            fear but that you shall be accepted; for he is like a Lamb to
				            all that come to him, and receives then with infinite grace
				            and tenderness. It is true he has awful majesty, he is the
				            great God, and infinitely high above you; but there is this to
				            encourage and embolden the poor sinner, that Christ is man as
				            well as God; he is a creature, as well as the Creator, and he
				            is the most humble and lowly in heart of any creature in
				            heaven or earth. This may well make the poor unworthy creature
				            bold in coming to him. You need not hesitate one moment; but
				            may run to him, and cast yourself upon him. You will certainly
				            be graciously and meekly received by him. Though he is a lion,
				            he will only be a lion to your enemies, but he will be a lamb
				            to you. It could not have been conceived, had it not been so
				            in the person of Christ, that there could have been so much in
				            any Savior, that is inviting and tending to encourage sinners
				            to trust in him. Whatever your circumstances are, you need not
				            be afraid to come to such a Savior as this. Be you never so
				            wicked a creature, here is worthiness enough; be you never so
				            poor, and mean, and ignorant a creature, there is no danger of
				            being despised, for though he be so much greater than you, he
				            is also immensely more humble than you. Any one of you that is
				            a father or mother, will not despise one of your own children
				            that comes to you in distress: much less danger is there of
				            Christ's despising you, if you in your heart come to him.
				            Here let me a little expostulate with the poor, burdened,
				            distressed soul.
				              1. What are you afraid of, that you dare not venture your
				                 soul upon Christ? Are you afraid that he cannot save you,
				                 that he is not strong enough to conquer the enemies of
				                 your soul? But how can you desire one stronger than "the
				                 almighty God"? as Christ is called, Isa. 9:6. Is there
				                 need of greater than infinite strength? Are you afraid
				                 that he will not be willing to stoop so low as to take
				                 any gracious notice of you? But then, look on him, as he
				                 stood in the ring of soldiers, exposing his blessed face
				                 to be buffeted and spit upon by them! Behold him bound
				                 with his back uncovered to those that smote him! And
				                 behold him hanging on the cross! Do you think that he
				                 that had condescension enough to stoop to these things,
				                 and that for his crucifiers, will be unwilling to accept
				                 of you, if you come to him? Or, are you afraid that if he
				                 does accept you, that God the Father will not accept of
				                 him for you? But consider, will God reject his own Son,
				                 in whom his infinite delight is, and has been, from all
				                 eternity, and who is so united to him, that if he should
				                 reject him he would reject himself?
				              2. What is there that you can desire should be in a Savior,
				                 that is not in Christ? Or, wherein should you desire a
				                 Savior should be otherwise than Christ is? What
				                 excellency is there wanting? What is there that is great
				                 or good; what is there that is venerable or winning; what
				                 is there that is adorable or endearing; or, what can you
				                 think of that would be encouraging, which is not to be
				                 found in the person of Christ? Would you have your Savior
				                 to be great and honorable, because you are not willing to
				                 be beholden to a mean person? And, is not Christ a person
				                 honorable enough to be worthy that you should be
				                 dependent on him? Is he not a person high enough to be
				                 appointed to so honorable a work as your salvation? Would
				                 you not only have a Savior of high degree, but would you
				                 have him, notwithstanding his exaltation and dignity, to
				                 be made also of low degree, that he might have experience
				                 of afflictions and trials, that he might learn by the
				                 things that he has suffered, to pity them that suffer and
				                 are tempted? And has not Christ been made low enough for
				                 you? and has he not suffered enough? Would you not only
				                 have him possess experience of the afflictions you now
				                 suffer, but also of that amazing wrath that you fear
				                 hereafter, that he may know how to pity those that are in
				                 danger, and afraid of it? This Christ has had experience
				                 of, which experience gave him a greater sense of it, a
				                 thousand times, than you have, or any man living has.
				                 Would you have your Savior to be one who is near to God,
				                 that so his mediation might be prevalent with him? And
				                 can you desire him to be nearer to God than Christ is,
				                 who is his only-begotten Son, of the same essence with
				                 the Father? And would you not only have him near to God,
				                 but also near to you, that you may have free access to
				                 him? And would you have him nearer to you than to be in
				                 the same nature, united to you by a spiritual union, so
				                 close as to be fitly represented by the union of the wife
				                 to the husband, of the branch to the vine, of the member
				                 to the head; yea, so as to be one spirit? For so he will
				                 be united to you, if you accept of him. Would you have a
				                 Savior that has given some great and extraordinary
				                 testimony of mercy and love to sinners, by something that
				                 he has done, as well as by what he says? And can you
				                 think or conceive of greater things than Christ has done?
				                 Was it not a great thing for him, who was God, to take
				                 upon him human nature: to be not only God, but man
				                 thenceforward to all eternity? But would you look upon
				                 suffering for sinners to be a yet greater testimony of
				                 love to sinners, than merely doing, though it be ever so
				                 extraordinary a thing that he has done? And would you
				                 desire that a Savior should suffer more than Christ has
				                 suffered for sinners? What is there wanting, or what
				                 would you add if you could, to make him more fit to be
				                 your Savior?
				            But further, to induce you to accept of Christ as your Savior,
				            consider two things particularly.
				              1. How much Christ appears as the Lamb of God in his
				                 invitations to you to come to him and trust in him. With
				                 what sweet grace and kindness does he, from time to time,
				                 call and invite you, as Prov. 8:4. "Unto you, O men, I
				                 call, and my voice is to the sons of men." And Isaiah
				                 55:1-3 "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
				                 waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat--
				                 yea come, buy wine and milk without money, and without
				                 price." How gracious is he here in inviting every one
				                 that thirsts, and in so repeating his invitation over and
				                 over, "Come ye to the waters, come, buy and eat - - yea
				                 come!" Mark the excellency of that entertainment which he
				                 invites you to accept of; "Come, buy wine and milk!" your
				                 poverty, having nothing to pay for it, shall be no
				                 objection, "Come, he that hath no money, come without
				                 money, and without price!" What gracious arguments and
				                 expostulations he uses with you! "Wherefore do ye spend
				                 money for that which is not bread? and your labor for
				                 that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me,
				                 and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight
				                 itself in fatness." As much as to say, It is altogether
				                 needless for you to continue laboring and toiling for
				                 that which can never serve your turn, seeking rest in the
				                 world, and in your own righteousness -- I have made
				                 abundant provision for you, of that which is really good,
				                 and will fully satisfy your desires, and answer your end,
				                 and I stand ready to accept of you: you need not be
				                 afraid; If you will come to me, I will engage to see all
				                 your wants supplied, and you made a happy creature. As he
				                 promises in the third verse, "Incline your ear, and come
				                 unto me: Hear, and your soul shall live, and I will make
				                 an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies
				                 of David." And so Prov. 9 at the beginning. How gracious
				                 and sweet is the invitation there! "Whoso is simple, let
				                 him turn in hither;" let you be never so poor, ignorant,
				                 and blind a creature, you shall be welcome. And in the
				                 following words Christ sets forth the provision that he
				                 has made for you, "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of
				                 the wine which I have mingled." You are in a poor
				                 famishing state, and have nothing wherewith to feed your
				                 perishing soul; you have been seeking something, but yet
				                 remain destitute. Hearken, how Christ calls you to eat of
				                 his bread, and to drink of the wine that he hath mingled!
				                 And how much like a lamb does Christ appear in Matt. 9:28
				                 30. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
				                 and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and
				                 learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
				                 shall find rest to your souls. For my yoke is easy, and
				                 my burden is light." O thou poor distressed soul! whoever
				                 thou art, consider that Christ mentions thy very case
				                 when he calls to them who labor and are heavy laden! How
				                 he repeatedly promises you rest if you come to him! In
				                 the 28th verse he says, "I will give you rest." And in
				                 the 29th verse, "Ye shall find rest to your souls." This
				                 is what you want. This is the thing you have been so long
				                 in vain seeking after. O how sweet would rest be to you,
				                 if you could but obtain it! Come to Christ, and you shall
				                 obtain it. And hear how Christ, to encourage you,
				                 represents himself as a lamb! He tells you, that he is
				                 meek and lowly in heart, and are you afraid to come to
				                 such a one! And again, Rev. 3:20. "Behold, I stand at the
				                 door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the
				                 door, I will come in to him, and I will sup with him and
				                 he with me." Christ condescends not only to call you to
				                 him, but he comes to you; he comes to your door, and
				                 there knocks. He might send an officer and seize you as a
				                 rebel and vile malefactor, but instead of that, he comes
				                 and knocks at your door, and seeks that you would receive
				                 him into your house, as your Friend and Savior. And he
				                 not only knocks at your door, but he stands there
				                 waiting, while you are backward and unwilling. And not
				                 only so, but he makes promises what he will do for you,
				                 if you will admit him, what privileges he will admit you
				                 to; he will sup with you, and you with him. And again,
				                 Rev. 22:16,17. "I am the root and the offspring of David,
				                 and the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the
				                 bride say, Come. And let him that heareth, say, Come. And
				                 let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will let him
				                 take of the water of life freely." How does Christ here
				                 graciously set before you his own winning attractive
				                 excellency! And how does he condescend to declare to you
				                 not only his own invitation, but the invitation of the
				                 Spirit and the bride, if by any means he might encourage
				                 you to come! And how does he invite every one that will,
				                 that they may "take of the water of life freely," that
				                 they may take it as a free gift, however precious it be,
				                 and though it be the Water of life.
				              2. If you do come to Christ, he will appear as a Lion, in
				                 his glorious power and dominion, to defend you. All those
				                 excellencies of his, in which he appears as a lion, shall
				                 be yours, and shall be employed for you in your defense,
				                 for your safety, and to promote your glory, he will be as
				                 a lion to fight against your enemies. He that touches
				                 you, or offends you, will provoke his wrath, as he that
				                 stirs up a lion. Unless your enemies can conquer this
				                 Lion, they shall not be able to destroy or hurt you;
				                 unless they are stronger than he, they shall not be able
				                 to hinder your happiness. Isaiah 31:4. "For thus hath the
				                 Lord spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion
				                 roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is
				                 called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their
				                 voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them; so shall
				                 the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and
				                 for the hill thereof."
				            C) Let what has been said be improved to induce you to love
				            the Lord Jesus Christ, and choose him for your friend and
				            portion. As there is such an admirable meeting of diverse
				            excellencies in Christ, so there is every thing in him to
				            render him worthy of your love and choice, and to win and
				            engage it. Whatsoever there is or can be desirable in a
				            friend, is in Christ, and that to the highest degree that can
				            be desired.
				            Would you choose for a friend a person of great dignity? It is
				            a thing taking with men to have those for their friends who
				            are much above them; because they look upon themselves honored
				            by the friendship of such. Thus, how taking would it be with
				            an inferior maid to be the object of the dear love of some
				            great and excellent prince. But Christ is infinitely above
				            you, and above all the princes of the earth; for he is the
				            King of kings. So honorable a person as this offers himself to
				            you, in the nearest and dearest friendship.
				            And would you choose to have a friend not only great but good?
				            In Christ infinite greatness and infinite goodness meet
				            together, and receive lustre and glory one from another. His
				            greatness is rendered lovely by his goodness. The greater any
				            one is without goodness, so much the greater evil; but when
				            infinite goodness is joined with greatness, it renders it a
				            glorious and adorable greatness. So, on the other hand, his
				            infinite goodness receives lustre from his greatness. He that
				            is of great understanding and ability, and is withal of a good
				            and excellent disposition, is deservedly more esteemed than a
				            lower and lesser being with the same kind inclination and good
				            will. Indeed goodness is excellent in whatever subject it be
				            found; it is beauty and excellency itself, and renders all
				            excellent that are possessed of it; and yet most excellent
				            when joined with greatness. The very same excellent qualities
				            of gold render the body in which they are inherent more
				            precious, and of greater value, when joined with greater than
				            when with lesser dimensions. And how glorious is the sight, to
				            see him who is the great Creator and supreme Lord of heaven
				            and earth, full of condescension, tender pity and mercy,
				            towards the mean and unworthy! His almighty power, and
				            infinite majesty and self-sufficiency, render his exceeding
				            love and grace the more surprising And how do his
				            condescension and compassion endear his majesty, power, and
				            dominion, and render those attributes pleasant, that would
				            otherwise be only terrible! Would you not desire that your
				            friend, though great and honorable, should be of such
				            condescension and grace, and so to have the way opened to free
				            access to him, that his exaltation above you might not hinder
				            your free enjoyment of his friendship? -- And would you choose
				            not only that the infinite greatness and majesty of your
				            friend should be, as it were, mollified and sweetened with
				            condescension and grace; but would you also desire to have
				            your friend brought nearer to you? Would you choose a friend
				            far above you, and yet as it were upon a level with you too?
				            Though it be taking with men to have a near and dear friend of
				            superior dignity, yet there is also an inclination in them to
				            have their friend a sharer with them in circumstances. Thus is
				            Christ. Though he be the great God, yet he has, as it were,
				            brought himself down to be upon a level with you, so as to
				            become man as you are that he might not only be your Lord, but
				            your brother, and that he might be the more fit to be a
				            companion for such a worm of the dust. This is one end of
				            Christ's taking upon him man's nature, that his people might
				            be under advantages for a more familiar converse with him than
				            the infinite distance of the divine nature would allow of. And
				            upon this account the church longed for Christ's incarnation,
				            Cant. 8:1. "O that thou wert my brother that sucked the breast
				            of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss
				            thee, yea, I should not be despised." One design of God in the
				            gospel is to bring us to make God the object of our undivided
				            respect, that he may engross our regard every way, that
				            whatever natural inclination there is in our souls, he may be
				            the centre of it; that God may be all in all. But there is an
				            inclination in the creature, not only to the adoration of a
				            Lord and Sovereign, but to complacence in some one as a
				            friend, to love and delight in some one that may be conversed
				            with as a companion. And virtue and holiness do not destroy or
				            weaken this inclination of our nature. But so hath God
				            contrived in the affair of our redemption, that a divine
				            person may be the object even of this inclination of our
				            nature. And in order hereto, such a one is come down to us,
				            and has taken our nature, and is become one of us, and calls
				            himself our friend, brother, and companion. Psalm 122:8. "For
				            my brethren and companions' sake, will I now say, Peace be
				            within thee."
				            But is it not enough in order to invite and encourage you to
				            free access to a friend so great and high, that he is one of
				            infinite condescending grace, and also has taken your own
				            nature, and is become man? But would you, further to embolden
				            and win you, have him a man of wonderful meekness and
				            humility? Why, such a one is Christ! He is not only become man
				            for you, but far the meekest and most humble of all men, the
				            greatest instance of these sweet virtues that ever was, or
				            will be. And besides these, he has all other human
				            excellencies in the highest perfection. These, indeed, are no
				            proper addition to his divine excellencies. Christ has no more
				            excellency in his person, since his incarnation, than he had
				            before; for divine excellency is infinite, and cannot be added
				            to. Yet his human excellencies are additional manifestations
				            of his glory and excellency to us, and are additional
				            recommendations of him to our esteem and love, who are of
				            finite comprehension. Though his human excellencies are but
				            communications and reflections of his divine, and though this
				            light, as reflected, falls infinitely short of the divine
				            fountain of light in its immediate glory; yet the reflection
				            shines not without its proper advantages, as presented to our
				            view and affection. The glory of Christ in the qualifications
				            of his human nature, appears to us in excellencies that are of
				            our own kind, and are exercised in our own way and manner, and
				            so, in some respect, are peculiarly fitted to invite our
				            acquaintance and draw our affection. The glory of Christ as it
				            appears in his divinity, though far brighter, more dazzles our
				            eyes, and exceeds the strength of our sight or our
				            comprehension; but, as it shines in the human excellencies of
				            Christ, it is brought more to a level with our conceptions,
				            and suitableness to our nature and manner, yet retaining a
				            semblance of the same divine beauty, and a savor of the same
				            divine sweetness. But as both divine and human excellencies
				            meet together in Christ, they set off and recommend each other
				            to us. It tends to endear the divine majesty and holiness of
				            Christ to us, that these are attributes of one in our nature,
				            one of us, who is become our brother, and is the meekest and
				            humblest of men. It encourages us to look upon these divine
				            perfections, however high and great; since we have some near
				            concern in and liberty freely to enjoy them. And on the other
				            hand, how much more glorious and surprising do the meekness,
				            the humility, obedience, resignation, and other human
				            excellencies of Christ appear, when we consider that they are
				            in so great a person, as the eternal Son of God, the Lord of
				            heaven and earth!
				            By your choosing Christ for your friend and portion, you will
				            obtain these two infinite benefits.
				              1. Christ will give himself to you, with all those various
				                 excellencies that meet in him, to your full and
				                 everlasting enjoyment. He will ever after treat you as
				                 his dear friend; and you shall ere long be where he is,
				                 and shall behold his glory, and dwell with him, in most
				                 free and intimate communion and enjoyment.
				                 When the saints get to heaven, they shall not merely see
				                 Christ, and have to do with him as subjects and servants
				                 with a glorious and gracious Lord and Sovereign, but
				                 Christ will entertain them as friends and brethren. This
				                 we may learn from the manner of Christ's conversing with
				                 his disciples here on earth: though he was their
				                 Sovereign Lord, and did not refuse, but required, their
				                 supreme respect and adoration, yet he did not treat them
				                 as earthly sovereigns are wont to do their subjects. He
				                 did not keep them at an aweful distance, but all along
				                 conversed with them with the most friendly familiarity,
				                 as a father amongst a company of children, yea, as with
				                 brethren. So he did with the twelve, and so he did with
				                 Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. He told his disciples, that he
				                 did not call them servants, but friends, and we read of
				                 one of them that leaned on his bosom: and doubtless he
				                 will not treat his disciples with less freedom and
				                 endearment in heaven. He will not keep them at a greater
				                 distance for his being in a state of exaltation; but he
				                 will rather take them into a state of exaltation with
				                 him. This will be the improvement Christ will make of his
				                 own glory, to make his beloved friends partakers with
				                 him, to glorify them in his glory, as he says to his
				                 Father, John 17:22, 23. "And the glory which thou hast
				                 given me, have I given them, that they may be one, even
				                 as we are one I in them" etc. We are to consider, that
				                 though Christ is greatly exalted, yet he is exalted, not
				                 as a private person for himself only, but as his people's
				                 head; he is exalted in their name, and upon their
				                 account, as the first fruits, and as representing the
				                 whole harvest. He is not exalted that he may be at a
				                 greater distance from them, but that they may be exalted
				                 with him. The exaltation and honor of the head is not to
				                 make a greater distance between the head and the members,
				                 but the members have the same relation and union with the
				                 head they had before, and are honored with the head; and
				                 instead of the distance being greater, the union shall be
				                 nearer and more perfect. When believers get to heaven,
				                 Christ will conform them to himself, as he is set down in
				                 his Father's throne, so they shall sit down with him on
				                 his throne, and shall in their measure be made like him.
				                 When Christ was going to heaven, he comforted his
				                 disciples with the thought, that after a while, he would
				                 come again and take them to himself, that they might be
				                 with him. And we are not to suppose that when the
				                 disciples got to heaven, they found him keeping a greater
				                 distance than he used to do. No, doubtless, be embraced
				                 them as friends, and welcomed them to his and their
				                 Father's house, and to his and their glory. They who had
				                 been his friends in this world, who had been together
				                 with him here, and had together partaken of sorrows and
				                 troubles, are now welcomed by him to rest, and to partake
				                 of glory with him. He took them and led them into his
				                 chambers, and showed them all his glory; as he prayed,
				                 John 17:24. "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast
				                 given me, be with me, that they may behold the glory
				                 which thou hast given me." And he led them to his living
				                 fountains of waters, and made them partake of his
				                 delights, as he prays John 17:13. "That my joy may be
				                 fulfilled in themselves," and set them down with him at
				                 his table in his kingdom, and made them partake with him
				                 of his dainties, according to his promise, Luke 22:30,
				                 and led them into his banqueting house, and made them to
				                 drink new wine with him in the kingdom of his heavenly
				                 Father, as he foretold them when he instituted the Lord's
				                 supper, Matt. 26:29.
				                 Yea the saints' conversation with Christ in heaven shall
				                 not only be as intimate, and their access to him as free,
				                 as of the disciples on earth, but in many respects much
				                 more so; for in heaven, that vital union shall be
				                 perfect, which is exceeding imperfect here. While the
				                 saints are in this world, there are great remains of sin
				                 and darkness to separate or disunite them from Christ,
				                 which shall then all be removed. This is not a time for
				                 that full acquaintance, and those glorious manifestations
				                 of love, which Christ designs for his people hereafter;
				                 which seems to be signified by his speech to Mary
				                 Magdalene, when ready to embrace him, when she met him
				                 after his resurrection; John 20:17. "Jesus saith unto
				                 her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my
				                 Father."
				                 When the saints shall see Christ's glory and exaltation
				                 in heaven, it will indeed possess their hearts with the
				                 greater admiration and adoring respect, but it will not
				                 awe them into any separation, but will serve only to
				                 heighten their surprise and joy, when they find Christ
				                 condescending to admit them to such intimate access, and
				                 so freely and fully communicating himself to them. So
				                 that if we choose Christ for our friend and portion, we
				                 shall hereafter be so received to him, that there shall
				                 be nothing to hinder the fullest enjoyment of him, to the
				                 satisfying the utmost cravings of our souls. We may take
				                 our full swing at gratifying our spiritual appetite after
				                 these holy pleasures. Christ will then say, as in Cant.
				                 5:1. "Eat, O friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly O
				                 beloved." And this shall be our entertainment to all
				                 eternity! There shall never be any end of this happiness,
				                 or any thing to interrupt our enjoyment of it, or in the
				                 least to molest us in it!
				              2. By your being united to Christ, you will have a more
				                 glorious union with and enjoyment of God the Father, than
				                 otherwise could be. For hereby the saints' relation to
				                 God becomes much nearer; they are the children of God in
				                 a higher manner than otherwise could be. For, being
				                 members of God's own Son, they are in a sort partakers of
				                 his relation to the Father: they are not only sons of God
				                 by regeneration, but by a kind of communion in the
				                 sonship of the eternal Son. This seems to be intended,
				                 Gal. 4:4-6. "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,
				                 made under the law, to redeem them that are under the
				                 law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And
				                 because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
				                 his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." The
				                 church is the daughter of God not only as he hath
				                 begotten her by his word and Spirit but as she is the
				                 spouse of his eternal Son.
				                 So we being members of the Son, are partakers in our
				                 measure of the Father's love to the Son, and complacence
				                 in him. John 17:23. "I in them, and thou in me, -- Thou
				                 hast loved them as thou hast loved me." And ver. 26.
				                 "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in
				                 them." And chap. 16:27. "The Father himself loveth you,
				                 because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came
				                 out from God." So we shall, according to our capacities,
				                 be partakers of the Son's enjoyment of God, and have his
				                 joy fulfilled in ourselves, John 17:13. And by this means
				                 we shall come to an immensely higher, more intimate and
				                 full enjoyment of God, than otherwise could have been.
				                 For there is doubtless an infinite intimacy between the
				                 Father and the Son which is expressed by his being in the
				                 bosom of the Father. And saints being in him, shall, in
				                 their measure and manner, partake with him in it, and of
				                 the blessedness of it.
				                 And thus is the affair of our redemption ordered, that
				                 thereby we are brought to an immensely more exalted kind
				                 of union with God, and enjoyment of him, both the Father
				                 and the Son, than otherwise could have been. For Christ
				                 being united to the human nature, we have advantage for a
				                 more free and full enjoyment of him, than we could have
				                 had if he had remained only in the divine nature. So
				                 again, we being united to a divine person, as his
				                 members, can have a more intimate union and intercourse
				                 with God the Father, who is only in the divine nature,
				                 than otherwise could be. Christ, who is a divine person,
				                 by taking on him our nature, descends from the infinite
				                 distance and height above us, and is brought nigh to us;
				                 whereby we have advantage for the full enjoyment of him.
				                 And, on the other hand, we, by being in Christ a divine
				                 person, do as it were ascend up to God, through the
				                 infinite distance, and have hereby advantage for the full
				                 enjoyment of him also.
				            This was the design of Christ, that he, and his Father, and
				            his people, might all be united in one. John 17:21 23. "That
				            they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee
				            -- that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe
				            that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou hast given
				            me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are
				            one; I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect
				            in one." Christ has brought it to pass, that those whom the
				            Father has given him should be brought into the household of
				            God, that he and his Father, and his people, should be as one
				            society, one family; that the church should be as it were
				            admitted into the society of the blessed Trinity.

				WICKED MEN USEFUL IN THEIR DESTRUCTION ONLY
				
				  Ezekiel 15:2-4 -- Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree? Or
				  than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? Shall wood be taken
				  thereof to do any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel
				  thereon? Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; The fire devoureth both
				  the ends of it, and the midst of it is burnt: Is it meet for any work?
				
				   THE visible church of God is here compared to the vine tree, as is
				   evident by God's own explanation of the allegory, in verses 6, 7, and
				   8. "Therefore thus saith the Lord God, As the vine tree among the trees
				   of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give
				   the inhabitants of Jerusalem," &c. And it may be understood of mankind
				   in general. We find man often in scripture compared to a vine. So in
				   chapter 32 of Deuteronomy, "Their vine is the vine of Sodom, and of the
				   fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall." And Psalm lxxx.
				   8. "Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt;" verse 14. "Look down from
				   heaven, behold, and visit this vine." And Canticles ii. 15. "The foxes
				   that spoil the vines; for our vines have tender grapes." Isaiah v. at
				   the beginning, "My beloved hath a vineyard, and he planted it with the
				   choicest vine." Jeremiah ii. 2l. "I had planted thee a noble vine."
				   Hosea x. 1. "Israel is an empty vine." So in chapter 15 of John,
				   visible Christians are compared to the branches of a vine.
				
				   Man is very fitly represented by the vine. The weakness and dependence
				   of the vine on other things which support it, well represents to us
				   what a poor, feeble, dependent creature man is, and how, if left to
				   himself, he must fall into mischief, and cannot help himself. The
				   visible people of God are fitly compared to a vine, because of the care
				   and cultivation of the husbandman, or vine dresser. The business of
				   husbandmen in the land of Israel was very much in their vineyards,
				   about vines; and the care they exercised to fence them, to defend them,
				   to prune them, to prop them up, and to cultivate them, well represented
				   that merciful care which God exercises towards his visible people; and
				   this latter is often in scripture expressly compared to the former.
				
				   In the words now read is represented,
				
				   1. How wholly useless and unprofitable, even beyond other trees, a vine
				   is, in case of unfruitfulness: "What is a vine tree more than any tree,
				   or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?" i.e. if it do
				   not bear fruit. Men make much more of a vine than of other trees; they
				   take great care of it, to wall it in, to dig about it, to prune it, and
				   the like. It is much more highly esteemed than any one of the trees of
				   the forest; they are despised in comparison with it. And if it bear
				   fruit, it is indeed much preferable to other trees; for the fruit of it
				   yields a noble liquor; as it is said in Jotham's parable, Judges ix.
				   13. "And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
				   cheereth God and man?"
				   But if it bear no fruit, it is more unprofitable than the trees of the
				   forest; for the wood of them is good for timber; but the wood of the
				   vine is fit for no work; as in the text, "Shall wood be taken thereof
				   to do any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel
				   thereon?"
				
				   2. The only thing for which a vine is useful, in case of barrenness,
				   viz. for fuel: "Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel." It is
				   wholly consumed; no part of it is worth a saving, to make any
				   instrument of it, for any work.
				
				  DOCTRINE
				
				   If men bring forth no fruit to God, they are wholly useless, unless in
				   their destruction.
				   For the proof of this doctrine, I shall show,
				   1. That it is very evident, that there can be but two ways in which man
				   can be useful, viz. either in acting, or in being acted upon, and
				   disposed of.
				   2. That man can no otherwise be useful actively than by bringing forth
				   fruit to God.
				   3. That if he bring not forth fruit to God, there is no other way in
				   which he can be passively useful, but in being destroyed.
				   4. In that way he may be useful without bearing fruit.
				
				   I. There are but two ways in which man can be useful, viz. either in
				   acting or being acted upon. If man be an useful sort of creature, he
				   must be so either actively or passively: There is no medium. If he be
				   useful to any purpose, he must be so either in acting himself, or else
				   in being disposed of by some other; either in doing something himself
				   to that purpose, or else in having something done upon him by some
				   other to that purpose. What can be more plain, than that if man do
				   nothing himself, and nothing be done with him or upon him by any other,
				   he cannot be any way at all useful? If man do nothing himself to
				   promote the end of his existence, and no other being do any thing with
				   him to promote this end, then nothing will be done to promote this end;
				   and so man must be wholly useless. So that there are but two ways in
				   which man can be useful to any purpose, viz. either actively or
				   passively, either in doing something himself, or in being the subject
				   of something done to him.
				
				   II. Man cannot be useful actively, any otherwise than in bringing forth
				   fruit to God, than in serving God, and living to his glory. This is the
				   only way wherein he can be useful in doing; and that for this reason,
				   that the glory of God is the very thing for which man was made, and to
				   which all other ends are subordinate. Man is not an independent being,
				   but he derives his being from another; and therefore hath his end
				   assigned him by that other: And he that gave him his being, made him
				   for the end now mentioned. This was the very design and aim of the
				   Author of man, this was the work for which he made him, viz. to serve
				   and glorify his Maker.
				
				   Other creatures are made for inferior purposes. Inferior creatures were
				   made for inferior purposes. But it is to be observed, that man is the
				   creature that is highest, and nearest to God, of any in this lower
				   world; and therefore his business is with God, although other creatures
				   are made for lower ends. There my be observed a kind of gradation, or
				   gradual ascent, in the order of the different kinds of creatures, from
				   the meanest clod of earth to man, who hath a rational and immortal
				   soul. A plant, an herb, or tree, is superior in nature to a stone or
				   clod, because it hath a vegetable life. The brute creatures are a
				   degree higher still; for they have sensitive life. But man, having a
				   rational soul, is the highest of this lower creation, and is next to
				   God; therefore his business is with God.
				
				   Things without life, as earth, water, &c. are subservient to things
				   above them, as the grass, herbs and trees. These vegetables are
				   subservient to that order of creatures which is next above them, the
				   brute creation; they are for food to them. Brute creatures, again, are
				   made for the use and service of the order above them; they are made for
				   the service of mankind. But man being the highest of this lower
				   creation, the next step from him is to God. He therefore is made for
				   the service and glory of God. This is the whole work and business of
				   man; it is his highest end, to which all other ends are subordinate.
				
				   If it had not been for this end, there never would have been any such
				   sort of creature as man; there would have been no occasion for it.
				   Other inferior ends may be answered as well, without any such creature
				   as man. There would have been no sort of occasion for making so noble a
				   creature, and endowing him with such faculties, only to enjoy earthly
				   good, to eat, and to drink, and to enjoy sensual things. Brute
				   creatures, without reason, are capable of these things, as well as man;
				   Yea, if no higher end be aimed at than to enjoy sensitive good, reason
				   is rather an hinderance than an help. It doth but render man the more
				   capable of afflicting himself with care, and fears of death, and other
				   future evils, and of vexing himself with many anxieties, from which
				   brute creatures are wholly free, and therefore can gratify their senses
				   with less molestation. Besides, reason doth but make men more capable
				   of molesting and impeding one another in the gratification of their
				   senses. If man have no other end to seek but to gratify his senses,
				   reason is nothing but an impediment.
				
				   Therefore if man be not made to serve and glorify his Creator, it is
				   wholly to no purpose that such a creature is made. Doubtless then the
				   all wise God, who doth all things in infinite wisdom, hath made man for
				   this end. And this is agreeable to what he hath taught us in many
				   places in the scriptures. This is the great end for which man was made,
				   and for which he was made such a creature as he is, having a body and
				   soul, bodily senses, and rational powers. For this is he placed in such
				   circumstances as he is, and the earth is given him for a possession.
				   For this he hath dominion given him over the rest of the creatures of
				   this world. For this the sun shines on him, and the moon and stars are
				   for signs and seasons to him, and the rain falls on him, and the earth
				   yields him her increase.
				
				   All other ends of man are subordinate to this. There are inferior ends
				   for which man was made. Men were made for one another; made for their
				   friends and neighbors, and for the good of the public. But all these
				   inferior ends are designed to be subordinate to the higher end of
				   glorifying God; and therefore man cannot be actively useful, or
				   actively answer any purpose, otherwise than by actively glorifying God,
				   or bringing forth fruit to God. Because,
				
				   1. That is not actively useful which doth not actively answer its end.
				   That which doth not answer its end is in vain; for that is the meaning
				   of the proposition, that any thing is in vain. So that which doth not
				   actively answer its end, is, as to its own activity, in vain.
				
				   2. That is as to its own activity altogether useless which actively
				   answers only subordinate ends, without answering the ultimate end; and
				   that because the ultimate end is the end of subordinate ends. The
				   notion of a supreme end is, that it is the end of all inferior ends.
				   Subordinate ends are to no purpose, only as they stand related to the
				   highest end. The very notion of a subordinate end is, that it is in
				   order to a further end. Therefore these inferior ends are good for
				   nothing though they be obtained, unless they also obtain their end.
				   Inferior ends are not aimed at for their own sake, but only for the
				   sake of the ultimate end. Therefore he that fails of his great end of
				   all, doth as much altogether fail of his end, and is as much to no
				   purpose, as if he did not obtain his subordinate end.
				
				   I will illustrate this by two or three examples. The subordinate end of
				   the underpinning of an house is to support the house; and the
				   subordinate end of the windows is to let in the light. But the ultimate
				   end of the whole is the benefit of the inhabitants. Therefore, if the
				   house be never inhabited, the whole is in vain. The underpinning is in
				   vain, though it be ever so strong and support the building ever so
				   well. The windows also are wholly in vain, though they be ever so large
				   and clear, and though they obtain the subordinate end of letting in the
				   light: They are as much in vain, as if they let in no light.
				
				   So the subordinate end of the husbandman in ploughing and sowing, and
				   well manuring his field is, that it may bring forth a crop. But his
				   more ultimate end is, that food may be provided for him and his family.
				   Therefore though his inferior end be obtained, and his field bring
				   forth ever so good a crop, yet if after all it be consumed by fire, or
				   otherwise destroyed, he ploughed and sowed his field as much in vain,
				   as if the seed had never sprung up.
				   So if man obtain his subordinate ends ever so fully; yet if he
				   altogether fail of his ultimate end, he is wholly an useless creature.
				   Thus if men be very useful in temporal things to their families, or
				   greatly promote the temporal interest of the neighborhood, or of the
				   public; yet if no glory be brought to God by it, they are altogether
				   useless. If men actively bring no glory to God, they are, as to their
				   own activity, altogether useless, how much soever they may promote the
				   benefit of one another. How much soever one part of mankind may
				   subserve another; yet if the end of the whole be not answered, every
				   part is useless.
				
				   Thus if the parts of a clock subserve ever so well one to another,
				   mutually to assist each other in their motions; one wheel moving
				   another ever so regularly; yet if the motion never reach the hand or
				   the hammer, it is altogether in vain, as much as if it stood still. As
				   in a clock one wheel moves another, and that another, till at last the
				   motion comes to the hand and hammer, which immediately respect the eye
				   and the ear, otherwise all the motions are in vain; so it is in the
				   world, one man was made to be useful to another, and one part of
				   mankind to another; but the use of the whole is to bring glory to God
				   the maker or else all is in vain; and however a man may serve among his
				   fellow creatures, in a private or public capacity, upon the whole he is
				   in vain.
				
				   It may perhaps be objected, that a wicked man may, by being serviceable
				   to the public, be useful to many who do bring forth fruit to God, and
				   thus glorify him.
				
				   Answer 1. If he be so, he is no further useful than he brings glory to
				   God. It all hath an ultimate respect to that glory that is brought to
				   God, and is useful no further; as the motion of no one wheel of a clock
				   is any further useful, than as it finally respects the right pointing
				   of the hand, and striking of the hammer.
				
				   Answer 2. When it is thus, wicked men are useful only accidentally, and
				   not designedly. Although a wicked man may, by being serviceable to good
				   men, do what will be an advantage to them to their bringing forth fruit
				   to God; yet that serviceableness is not what he aims at; this is not
				   his end; he doth not look so far for an ultimate end. And how ever this
				   end be obtained, no thanks are due to him; it is as to him accidental.
				   He is only the occasion, and not the designing cause of it. That fruit
				   which is brought forth to the glory of God, is not brought forth by
				   him, but by others.
				   The usefulness of such a man, being not designed, is not to be
				   attributed to him as though it were his fruit. He is not useful as a
				   man, or as a rational creature, because he is not so designedly. He is
				   useful as things without life may be. Things without life may he useful
				   to put the godly under advantages to bring forth fruit, as the timber
				   and stones with which his house is built, the wool and flax with which
				   he is clothed; but the fruit which is brought forth to God's glory,
				   cannot be said for all that to be the fruit of these lifeless things,
				   but of the godly man who makes use of them. So it is when wicked men
				   put the godly under advantages to glorify God, as Cyrus, and
				   Artaxerxes, and others have done.
				
				   III. If men bring not forth fruit to God, there is no other way in
				   which they can be useful passively, but in being destroyed. They are
				   fit for nothing else.
				
				   1. They are not fit to be suffered to continue always in this world.
				   God suffers them to live for the present, but it is only for a certain
				   season. They are here in a transitory state. It is not fit that this
				   world should be the constant abode of those who bring forth no fruit to
				   God. It is not fit that the barren tree should be allowed always to
				   stand in the vineyard. The husbandman lets it stand for a while, till
				   he digs about it, dungs it, and proves it to be incurable, or till a
				   convenient time to cut it down come; but it is not fit that such a tree
				   should stand here always. It is not fit that they who bring forth no
				   fruit to God, should be suffered to live always in a world which is so
				   full of the goodness of God, or that his goodness should be spent upon
				   them forever.
				
				   This world, though it is fallen, and is under a curse, and is a
				   miserable place to what it once was, yet is full of the streams of
				   divine goodness. But it is not fit that those who bring forth no fruit
				   to God, should always be continued in partaking of these streams. There
				   are these three different states ; a state wherein is nothing but good,
				   which is the state of the blessed in heaven; a state wherein is a
				   mixture of good and evil, which is the earthly state ; and a state
				   wherein is nothing but evil, which is the state of eternal destruction
				   and damnation. Now they that bring forth no fruit to God, are not fit
				   for either of the former; it is not fit that they should be continued
				   in the enjoyment of any of the goodness of God.
				
				   It is not fit that an unprofitable, unfruitful creature, who will not
				   glorify his Creator, should always live here to devour the fruits of
				   the earth, and consume the fruits of divine bounty; to have the good
				   things of this life, as God's wool and his flax, his corn, and wine,
				   and oil, spent with him in vain. While a man lives in this world, the
				   other creatures of the world are subjected to him. The brute creatures
				   serve him with their labor and with their lives. The sun, moon, and
				   stars, the clouds, fields and trees, all serve him. But it is not fit
				   that these creatures should always be made to serve him, who brings
				   forth no fruit to the Creator. Why should God always keep his creatures
				   in subjection to that man, who will not be subject to him? Why should
				   the creation be always kept in such bondage, as to be subject to wicked
				   men? The creatures are made subject to vanity for a little time; God
				   hath subjected them to wicked men, and given them for their use. This
				   however he would not have done, but as it is only for a little while;
				   and the creatures can bear it through the hope of approaching
				   deliverance; and otherwise it would have been intolerable. Romans viii.
				   20. "For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
				   reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope."
				
				   The creature doth, as it were, groan by reason of this subjection to
				   wicked men, although it be but for a while. Romans viii.22. "For we
				   know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together
				   until now." Therefore surely it would be no way fit that wicked men,
				   who do no good, and bring forth no fruit to God, should live here
				   always, to have the various creatures subservient to them, as they are
				   now. The earth can scarcely bear wicked men during that short time for
				   which they stay here, but is ready to spew thee out. It is no way fit,
				   therefore, that it should be forced to bear them always.
				   Men who bring forth no fruit to God are cumberers of the ground. Luke
				   xiii. 7 "And it is not meet that they should be suffered to cumber the
				   ground always." God cannot be glorified in this way of disposing of
				   unfruitful persons. If such men should be suffered to live always in
				   such a state as this, it would be so far from being to the glory of
				   God, that it would be to the disparagement of the wisdom of God, to
				   continue them in a state so unsuitable for them, forever spending the
				   fruits of his bounty in vain upon them. It would also be a
				   disparagement to his justice; for this is a world where, "all things
				   come alike to all, and there is one event to the righteous and to the
				   wicked." If there were no other state but this for wicked men to be in,
				   justice could not possibly take place. It would also reflect upon the
				   holiness of God. Forever to uphold this world for an habitation of such
				   persons, and forever to continue the communications of his bounty and
				   goodness to them, would appear as though he were disposed to
				   countenance and encourage sin and wickedness.
				
				   2. If men do not bring forth fruit to God, they are not fit to be
				   disposed of in heaven. Heaven, above all others, is the most improper
				   place for them. Every thing appertaining to that state is unsuitable
				   for them. The company is most unsuitable. The original inhabitants of
				   that world are the angels. But what a disagreeable union would that be,
				   to unite wicked men and angels in the same society? The employments of
				   that world are unsuitable. The employments are serving and glorifying
				   God. How unsuitable then would it be to plant barren trees in that
				   heavenly paradise, trees that would bring forth no fruit to the divine
				   glory? The enjoyments of heaven are unsuitable. The enjoyments are holy
				   and spiritual enjoyments, the happiness of beholding the glory of God,
				   and praising his name, and the like. But these enjoyments are as
				   unsuitable as can be to the carnal earthly minds of wicked men. They
				   would be no enjoyments to them; but on the contrary would be most
				   disagreeable, and what they cannot relish, but entirely nauseate.
				
				   The design of heaven is unsuitable to them. The design of God in making
				   heaven was, that it might be a place of holy habitation, for the reward
				   of the righteous, and not an habitation for wicked men. It would
				   greatly reflect on the wisdom of God to dispose of wicked men there;
				   for it would be the greatest confusion. But God is not the author of
				   confusion, I Corinthians xiv. 33. It would be contrary to the holiness
				   of God, to take wicked men so near to himself into his glorious
				   presence, to dwell forever in that part of the creation which is, as it
				   were, his own palace, and to sit at his table. We read in Psalm v. 4.
				   "Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall
				   evil dwell with thee." Therefore it would doubtless be impossible that
				   the end of the existence of wicked men should be in any wise answered
				   by the placing of them in heaven.
				
				   IV. Men who bring forth no fruit to God, yet in suffering destruction
				   may be useful. Although they be not useful actively, or by any thing
				   which they do; yet they may be useful in what they may suffer; just as
				   a barren tree, which is no way useful standing in the vineyard, yet may
				   be good fuel, and be very useful in the fire. God can find use for the
				   most wicked men; he hath his use for vessels of wrath as well as for
				   vessels of mercy; as in an house there is use for vessels unto
				   dishonor, as well as for vessels unto honor. 2 Timothy ii. 20. "In a
				   great house there are not only vessels of gold, and of silver, but also
				   of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor."
				   Proverbs xvi. 4. "The Lord hath made all things for himself; yea, even
				   the wicked for the day of evil." I shall briefly take notice of what
				   ends God accomplishes by it.
				
				   1. Unfruitful persons are of use in their destruction for the glory of
				   God's justice. It was the will of God to glorify his justice, as well
				   as his mercy, on his creatures. The vindictive justice of God is a
				   glorious attribute, as well as his mercy; and the glory of this
				   attribute appears in the everlasting destruction and ruin of the barren
				   and unfruitful.
				   The glory of divine justice in the perdition of ungodly men appears
				   wonderful and glorious in the eyes of the saints and angels in heaven.
				   Hence we have an account, that they sing praises to God, and extol his
				   justice at the sight of the awful judgments which he inflicts on wicked
				   men. Revelation xvi. 5, "Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art and
				   wast, and art to come, because thou hast judged thus; for they have
				   shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood
				   to drink; for they are worthy:" And Revelation xix. 1, 2: "And after
				   these things I heard a great voice, saying, Alleluia: Salvation, and
				   glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and
				   righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore, which
				   did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood
				   of his servants at her hand."
				
				   2. Unfruitful persons in their destruction are of use for God to
				   glorify his majesty upon them. The awful majesty of God remarkably
				   appears in those dreadful and amazing punishments which he inflicts on
				   those who rise up against him, and contemn him. A sense of the majesty
				   of an earthly prince is supported very much by a sense of its being a
				   dreadful thing to affront him. God glorifies his own majesty in the
				   destruction of wicked men; and herein he appears infinitely great, in
				   that it appears to be an infinitely dreadful thing to offend him. How
				   awful doth the majesty of God appear in the dreadfulness of his anger!
				   This we may learn to be one end of the damnation of the wicked, from
				   Romans ix. 22. "What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his
				   power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath
				   fitted to destruction?"
				   It is often spoken of God, that he is a terrible God. It is a part of
				   the majesty and glory of God, that he is a terrible God. God tells
				   Pharaoh, that for this cause he raised him up, that he might show his
				   power in him, and that his name might be declared through all the
				   earth, in his destruction. Exodus ix. 15, 16; and again, chapter xiv.
				   17: "I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his
				   chariots, and upon his horsemen."
				
				   3. The destruction of the unfruitful is of use, to give the saints a
				   greater sense of their happiness, and of God's grace to them. The
				   wicked will be destroyed and tormented in the view of the saints, and
				   other inhabitants of heaven. This we are taught in Revelation xiv. 10.
				   "The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured
				   out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation ; and he shall be
				   tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels,
				   and in the presence of the Lamb." And in Isaiah lxvi. 24. "And they
				   shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have
				   transgressed against me : For their worm shall not die, neither shall
				   their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."
				
				   When the saints in heaven shall look upon the damned in hell, it will
				   serve to give them a greater sense of their own happiness, seeing how
				   vastly different their case is from their own. The view of the doleful
				   condition of the damned will make them the more prize their own
				   blessedness. When they shall see how dreadful the anger of God is, it
				   will make them the more prize his love. They will rejoice so much the
				   more that they are not the objects of God's anger, but of his favor;
				   that they are not the subjects of his dreadful wrath, but are treated
				   as his children, are taken near to him, to dwell in the everlasting
				   embraces of his love.
				
				   When they shall see the misery of the damned, it will give them a
				   greater sense of the distinguishing grace and love of God to them, that
				   God should from all eternity set his love on them, and make so great a
				   difference between them and others who are of the same species with
				   them, are no worse by nature than they, and have deserved no worse of
				   God than they. When they shall look upon the misery of the damned, and
				   consider how different their own state is from theirs, and that it is
				   only free and sovereign grace that makes the difference, what a great
				   sense will this give them of the wonderful grace of God to them! And
				   how will it heighten their praises! With how much greater admiration
				   and exultation of soul will they sing of the free and sovereign grace
				   of God to them!
				
				   When they shall look upon the damned, and see their misery, how will
				   heaven ring with the praises of God's justice towards the wicked, and
				   his grace towards the saints! And with how much greater enlargement of
				   heart will they praise Jesus Christ their Redeemer, that ever he was
				   pleased to set his love upon them, his dying love! And that he should
				   so distinguish them as to spill his blood, and make his soul an
				   offering, to redeem them from that so great misery, and to bring them
				   to such exceeding happiness!
				
				   With what love and ecstasy will they sing that song in Revelation v. 9.
				   10. "Thou art worthy: For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God
				   by thy blood, out of every tongue, and kindred, and people, and nation;
				   and hast made us unto our God kings and priests." One end which the
				   apostle mentions why God appointed vessels of wrath, is the more to
				   make known the wonderfulness of his mercy towards the saints. In Romans
				   ix. 22, 23. there are two ends mentioned: "What if God, willing to show
				   his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long
				   suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?" That is one end,
				   then another is mentioned immediately after: "And that he might make
				   known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had
				   afore prepared unto glory ?"
				
				  APPLICATION
				
				   I. Hence we may learn, how just and righteous God is in the destruction
				   of those who bring forth no fruit to God. Seeing there is no other way
				   in which they can be useful, or in which the end of their being can be
				   obtained, certainly it is most just that God should thus dispose of
				   them. Why should God be frustrated of his end through their
				   perverseness? If men will not do the work for which he hath made and
				   fitted them; if they, through a spirit of opposition and rebellion
				   against God, refuse; yet why should God suffer himself to be
				   disappointed of his end in making them? It doth not become the infinite
				   greatness and majesty of God, to suffer himself to be disappointed and
				   frustrated by the wickedness and perverseness of sinful worms of the
				   dust. If God should suffer this, it would seem to argue, either a want
				   of wisdom in God to fix upon a good end, or a want of power to
				   accomplish it.
				
				   God made all men that they might be useful; and if they will not be
				   useful in their conduct and actions, how just is it that God should
				   make them useful in their sufferings! God made all men for his own
				   glory; and if they, contrary to the revealed will of God, refuse to
				   glorify him actively and willingly, how just is it that God should
				   glorify himself upon them in what he doth with them!
				
				   It hath been shown, that there is no other way wherein this can be
				   done, but by their destruction. Surely, therefore, it must be just and
				   righteous that God should destroy them.
				
				   Men are under no natural necessity of being put to this use of
				   glorifying God in their sufferings. God gives them opportunity of
				   glorifying him in doing, in bringing forth fruit, puts them under
				   advantages for it, and uses many means to bring them to it. But if they
				   will not be useful this way, it is very just that God should make them
				   useful in the only remaining way in which they can be useful, viz. in
				   their destruction. God is not forward to put them to this use. He tells
				   us, that he hath "no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the
				   wicked turn from his way, and live;" Ezekiel xxxiii. 11. God represents
				   the destruction of sinners as a work to which he is backward; yet it is
				   meet that they should be destroyed, rather than that they should be
				   suffered to frustrate God of the end of their being. Who can blame the
				   husbandman for cutting down and burning a barren tree, after he hath
				   digged about it, and dunged it, and used all proper means to make it
				   fruitful?
				   Let those among us consider this, who have lived all their lives
				   hitherto unprofitably, and never have brought forth any fruit to God's
				   glory, notwithstanding all the means that have been used with them.
				   Consider how just it would be if God should utterly destroy you, and
				   glorify himself upon you in that way; and what a wonder of patience it
				   is, that God hath not done it before now.
				
				   II. This subject ought to put you upon examining yourselves, whether
				   you be not wholly useless creatures. You have now heard, that those who
				   bring forth no fruit to God, are, as to any good they do, wholly
				   useless. Inquire, therefore, whether you have ever in your lives
				   brought forth any fruit to God. Have you ever done any thing from a
				   gracious respect to God, or out of love to God? By only seeking your
				   worldly interest, you do not bring forth fruit to God. It is toot
				   bringing forth fruit to God, for you to come to public worship on the
				   Sabbath, to pray in your families, and other such like things, merely
				   in compliance with the general custom. It is not to bring forth fruit
				   to God, that you be sober, moral and religious, only to be seen of men,
				   or out of respect to your own credit and honor. How is that for God
				   which is only for the sake of custom, or the esteem of men?
				
				   It is not to bring forth fruit to God, for men to pray, and read, and
				   hear, and to be strict and diligent in religious and moral duties,
				   merely from the fear of hell. What thanks are due to you for not loving
				   your own misery, and for being willing to take some pains to escape
				   burning in hell to all eternity? There is ne'er a devil in hell but
				   would gladly do the same. Hosea x. 1. "Israel is an empty vine; he
				   bringeth forth fruit unto himself."
				   There is no fruit brought forth to God, where there is nothing done in
				   any wise from love to God, or from any true respect to him. God looketh
				   at the heart. He doth not stand in need of our services, neither is he
				   benefited by any thing that we can do. He doth not receive any thing of
				   us, because it benefits him, but only as a suitable testimony of our
				   love and respect to him. This is the fruit that he seeks. Men
				   themselves will not accept of those shows of friendship, which they
				   think are hypocritical, and come not from the heart. How much less
				   should God, who searcheth the hearts and trieth the reins of the
				   children of men! John iv. 23. "God is a spirit, and they that worship
				   him must worship him in spirit and in truth."
				   Inquire, therefore, whether you ever in your lives did the least thing
				   out of love to God. Have you not done all for yourselves? Zechariah
				   vii. 5, 6. "When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month,
				   even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even unto me? And
				   when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did ye not eat for yourselves,
				   and drink for yourselves? "
				
				   III. Another use of this subject may be of conviction and humiliation
				   to those who never have brought forth any fruit to God. If, upon
				   examination, you find that you have never in all your lives done any
				   thing out of a true respect to God, then it hath been demonstrated,
				   that, as to any thing which you do, you are altogether useless
				   creatures. And consider, what a shameful thing it is for such rational
				   beings as you are, and placed under such advantages for usefulness, yet
				   to be wholly useless, and to live in the world to no purpose!
				
				   We esteem it a very mean character in any person, that he is a
				   worthless, insignificant person; and to be called so is taken as a
				   great reproach. But consider seriously, whether you can clear
				   yourselves of this character. Set reason to work; can you rationally
				   suppose, that you do in any measure answer the end for which God gave
				   you your being, and made you of a nature superior to the beasts? But
				   that you may be sensible what cause you have to be ashamed of your
				   unprofitableness, consider the following things.
				
				   1. How much God hath bestowed upon you, in the endowments of your
				   nature. God hath made you rational, intelligent creatures, hath endowed
				   you with noble powers, those endowments wherein the natural image of
				   God consists. You are vastly exalted in your nature above other kinds
				   of creatures here below. You are capable of a thousand times as much as
				   any of the brute creatures. He hath given you a power of understanding,
				   which is capable of vastly extending itself, of looking back to the
				   beginning of time, and of considering what was before the world was,
				   and of looking forward beyond the end of time. It is capable of
				   extending beyond the utmost limits of the universe; and is a faculty
				   whereby you are akin to angels, and are capable even of knowing God, of
				   contemplating the divine Being, and his glorious perfections,
				   manifested in his works and in his word. You have souls capable of
				   being the habitation of the Holy Spirit of God, and his divine grace.
				   You are capable of the noble employments of angels.
				
				   How lamentable and shameful it is, that such a creature should be
				   altogether useless, and live in vain! How lamentable that such a noble
				   and excellent piece of divine workmanship should fail of its end, and
				   be to no purpose! Was it ever worth while for God to make you such a
				   creature, with such a noble nature, and so much above other kinds of
				   creatures, only to eat, and drink, and gratify your sensual appetites?
				   How lamentable and shameful to you, that such a noble tree should be
				   more useless than any tree of the forest; that man, whom God hath thus
				   set in honor, should make himself more worthless than the beasts that
				   perish!
				
				   2. How much God hath done for you in the creation of the world. He made
				   the earth, and seas, and all the fulness of them, for the use of man,
				   and hath given them to him. Psalm cxv. 16. "The earth hath he given to
				   the children of men." He made the vast variety of creatures for man's
				   use and service. Genesis i. 28. "Have dominion over the fish of the
				   sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
				   moveth upon the earth." For the same purpose he made all the plants,
				   and herbs, and trees of the field. Genesis i. 29. "I have given you
				   every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and
				   every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree, yielding seed; to you
				   it shall be for meat." He made the sun in the heavens, that glorious
				   luminary, that wonderful globe of light, to give light to man, and to
				   constitute the difference between day and night. He also made the moon,
				   and the vast multitude of stars, for the use of man, to be to him for
				   signs and seasons.
				
				   What great provision hath God made for man! What a vast variety of good
				   things for food, and otherwise to be for his convenience, to put him
				   under advantages to be useful! How lamentable is it, that after all
				   these things he should be an useless creature in the world!
				
				   3. How much is done for you in the course of God's common providence!
				   Consider how nature is continually laboring for you. The sun is, at it
				   were, in a ferment for mankind, unweariedly running his course from
				   year to year, and from day to day, and spending his rays upon man, to
				   put him under advantage to be useful; every day giving him light that
				   he may have opportunity to behold the glorious wisdom of God, and to
				   see and serve God. The winds and clouds are continually laboring for
				   you, and the waters are going in a constant circulation, ascending in
				   the air from the seas, descending in rain, gathering in streams and
				   rivers, returning to the sea, and again ascending and descending, for
				   you. The earth is continually laboring to bring forth her fruit for
				   your support. The trees of the field are laboring and spending their
				   strength for you. And how many of the poor brute creatures are
				   continually laboring for you, and spending their strength for you! How
				   much of the earth is spent upon you! How many of God's creatures are
				   devoured by you! How many of the lives of the living creatures of God
				   are destroyed for your sake, for your support and comfort!
				
				   Now, how lamentable will it be, if, after all, you be altogether
				   useless, and live to no purpose! What mere cumberers of the ground will
				   you be! Agreeably to Luke xiii. 7. Nature, which thus continually
				   labors for you, will be burdened with you. This seems to be what the
				   apostle means, Romans viii. 20, 21, 22, where he tells us, that the
				   creation is made subject to vanity, and brought into the bondage of
				   corruption; and that the whole creation groans, and travails in pain,
				   under this bondage.
				
				   4. How much is done for you in the use of the means of grace. How much
				   hath God done to provide you with suitable means and advantages for
				   usefulness! How many prophets hath God sent into the world, in
				   different ages, inspiring them with his Holy Spirit, and enabling them
				   to work many miracles to confirm their word, whereby you now have the
				   written word of God to instruct you!
				
				   How great a thing hath God done for you, to give you opportunity and
				   advantage to be useful, in that he hath sent his own Son into the
				   world! He who is really and truly God, united himself to the human
				   nature, and became a man, to be a prophet an teacher to you and other
				   sinners. Yea, he laid down his life to make atonement for sin, that you
				   might have encouragement to serve God with hopes of acceptance.
				
				   How many ordinances have been instituted for you! How much of the labor
				   of the ministers of God hath been spent upon you! Is not that true
				   concerning you which is written in Isaiah v. at the beginning,
				   concerning the vineyard planted in a very fruitful hill, and fenced and
				   cultivated with peculiar care and pains, which yet proved unfruitful?
				   How much hath the dresser of the vineyard digged about the barren tree,
				   and dunged it, and yet it remains barren!
				
				   Consider what a shame it is that you should live in vain, when all the
				   other creatures, that are inferior to you, do glorify their Creator,
				   according to their nature. You who are so highly exalted in the world,
				   are more useless than the brute creation; yea, than the meanest worms,
				   or things without life, as earth and stones: For they all do answer
				   their end, in the way in which nature hath fitted them for it; none of
				   them fail of it. They are all useful in their places, all render their
				   proper tribute of praise to their Creator; while you are mere nuisances
				   in the creation, and burdens to the earth; as any tree of the forest is
				   more useful than the vine, if it bear not fruit.
				
				   IV. Let me, in a farther application of this doctrine, exhort you by
				   all means to bring forth fruit to God. Let it be your constant endeavor
				   to be in this way actively useful in the world. Here consider three
				   things.
				
				   1. What an honor it will be to such poor creatures as you are, to bring
				   forth fruit to the divine glory. What is such a poor worm as man, that
				   he should be enabled to bring forth any fruit to God! It is the
				   greatest honor of the nature of man, that God hath given him a capacity
				   of glorifying the great Creator. It is what no other creature in this
				   lower world can do, in the same manner as man. There is no creature in
				   the visible world that is capable of actively glorifying God, but man.
				
				   2. In bringing forth fruit to God, you will be so profitable to none as
				   to yourselves; you cannot thereby be profitable to God. Job xxii. 2.
				   "Can a man be profitable to God?" You may thereby be profitable to your
				   fellow creatures; yet not so much as to yourselves. The fruit which you
				   bring forth to God will be a greater benefit to yourselves than to any
				   one living. You will be more useful to yourselves than to any one else.
				   Although you are under a natural obligation to bring forth fruit to
				   God, yet God doth not require it of you without a reward. He will
				   richly reward you for it. In requiring you to bring forth fruit to him,
				   he doth but require you to bring forth fruit to your own happiness. You
				   will taste the sweetness of your own fruit. It will be most profitable
				   for you in this world to bring forth fruit to God; it will be
				   exceedingly to your benefit while here. It will be pleasant to you to
				   lead a fruitful and holy life; the pleasure will be beyond the labor.
				   Beside this, God hath promised to such a life everlasting rewards,
				   unspeakable, infinite benefits. So that by it you will infinitely
				   advance your own interest.
				
				   3. If you remain thus unprofitable, and be not actively useful, surely
				   God will obtain his end of you, in your destruction. He will say
				   concerning the barren tree, "Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?"
				   Christ, in John xv. 6, tells us, "if a man abide not in me, he is cast
				   forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them
				   into the fire, and they are burned." This is spoken of the barren
				   branches in the vine. How would you yourselves do in such a case with a
				   barren tree in an orchard, or with weeds and tares in your fields?
				   Doubtless, it were in your power, you would utterly destroy them.
				
				   God will have his end; he will accomplish it. Though all men and devils
				   unite their endeavors, they cannot frustrate God in any thing; and
				   "though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished;"
				   Proverbs xi. 1. God hath sworn by his great name, that he will have his
				   glory of men, whether they will actively glorify him or no. Numbers
				   xiv. 21, 22, 23. "But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled
				   with the glory of the Lord. Because all those men which have seen my
				   glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and
				   have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
				   voice; surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
				   fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me, see it."
				
				   "The ax lieth at the root of the trees; and every tree which bringeth
				   not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire;" Matthew
				   iii. 10. The end of those men who bring forth nothing but briers and
				   thorns is to be burned, as in Hebrews vi. 7, 8. "For the earth which
				   drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs
				   meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: But
				   that which beareth thorns and briers, is rejected, and is nigh unto
				   cursing; whose end is to be burned." So we read of the tares, Matthew
				   xiii. 30. "Let both grow together until the harvest ; and in the time
				   of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
				   tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them;" and in verses 40, 41,
				   42, "As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so
				   shall it be at the end of the world. The Son of man shall send forth
				   his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that
				   offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace
				   of fire: There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
				
				   So it is said of the chaff, Matthew iii. 12. "Whose fan is in his hand,
				   and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the
				   garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
				
				   If you continue not to bring forth any fruit to the divine glory, as
				   you have hitherto done, hell will be the only fit place for you. It is
				   a place prepared on purpose to be a receptacle of such persons. In hell
				   nature ceases to labor any more for sinners: The sun doth not run his
				   course to shine upon them, the earth doth not bring forth her fruit to
				   be consumed upon them there. There they will have no opportunity to
				   consume the fruits of divine goodness on their lusts. In hell they can
				   prejudice or encumber nothing, upon which God sets any value. There the
				   faithful servants and ministers of God will no longer spend their
				   strength in vain upon them. When the barren tree is in the fire, the
				   servants of the husbandman are freed from any further labor or toil in
				   digging about it, and manuring it.
				
				   In hell they will no more have opportunity to clog and discourage the
				   flourishing of religion, and to destroy much good, as they often do in
				   this world. In hell they will no more have opportunity to corrupt
				   others by their ill example. In hell they will no more have it in their
				   power to offend the godly; they may hurt and torment one another; but
				   the godly will be out of their reach. In hell there will be no
				   ordinances, no Sabbaths, no sacraments, no sacred things, for them to
				   profane and defile by their careless and hypocritical attendance.
				
				   Hell, therefore, if you remain unfruitful and cumberers of the ground,
				   will be the fittest place for you, and there you will surely have your
				   portion assigned you. There God will get himself honor upon you; there
				   he will magnify himself in your ruin, in the presence of the holy
				   angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and will be praised upon that
				   account by the saints, at the day of judgment; and by all the host of
				   heaven throughout everlasting ages.

				The Vain Self-Flatteries of the Sinner
				
				  Psalm 36:2 -- For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
				  found to be hateful.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   IN the foregoing verse, David says, that the transgression of the
				   wicked said within his heart, "that there is no fear of God before his
				   eyes;" that is, when he saw that the wicked went on in sin, in an
				   allowed way of wickedness, it convinced him, that he was not afraid of
				   those terrible judgments, and of that wrath with which God hath
				   threatened sinners If he were afraid of these he could never go on so
				   securely in sin, as he doth.
				
				   In our text he gives the reason why the wicked did not fear. It was a
				   strange thing that men, who enjoyed such light as they did in the land
				   of Israel, who read and heard those many awful threatenings which were
				   written in the book of the law, should not be afraid to go on in sin.
				   But saith the Psalmist, They flatter themseIves in their own eyes: They
				   have something or other which they make a foundation of encouragement,
				   whereby they persuade themselves that they shall escape those
				   judgments; and that makes them put far away the evil day.
				
				   In this manner he proceeds, until his iniquity be found to be hateful;
				   that is, until he finds by experience that it is a more dreadful thing
				   to sin against God, and break his holy commands, than he imagined. He
				   thinks sin to be sweet, and hides it as a sweet morsel under his
				   tongue: He loves it, and flatters himself in it, till at length he
				   finds, by experience, that it is bitter as gall and wormwood. Though he
				   thinks the commission of sin to be lovely, yet he will find the fruit
				   of it to be hateful, and what he cannot endure. Proverbs xxiii. 32. "At
				   last it will bite like a serpent, and sting like an adder."
				
				   Here observe,
				
				   1. The subject spoken of is the wicked man, of whom the Psalmist had
				   been speaking in the foregoing verse.
				   2. His action in flattering himself in his own eyes; i.e. he makes
				   himself and his case to appear to himself, or in his own eyes, better
				   than it is.
				   3. How long he continues so to do, until his iniquity be found to be
				   hateful. 'Which may be taken for his sin itself, the wicked will see
				   how odious sin is to God', when he shall feel the effects of his
				   hatred, and how hateful to angels and saints; or rather the cause is
				   here put for the effect, the tree for its fruit, and he will find his
				   iniquity to be hateful, as he will find the hatefulness and feel the
				   terribleness of the fruit of his iniquity.
				
				  DOCTRINE
				
				   Wicked men generally flatter themselves with hopes of escaping
				   punishment, till it actually comes upon them.
				
				   There are but few sinners who despair, who give up the cause and
				   conclude with themselves, that they shall go to hell; yet there are but
				   few who do not go to hell. It is to be feared that men go to hell every
				   day out of this country; yet very few of them suffer themselves to
				   believe, that they are in any great danger of that punishment. They go
				   on sinning and travelling in the direct road to the pit; yet by one
				   mean or other they persuade themselves that they shall never fall into
				   it,
				   In my present discourse, I shall,
				
				   1. Mention some things in confirmation of the doctrine, that sinners
				   flatter themselves with the hope of impunity.
				   2. Mention some of the various ways wherein sinners flatter themselves
				   in that hope.
				   3. Show that sinners generally go on flattering themselves, till
				   punishment actually overtakes them.
				   I. I am to mention some things in confirmation of the doctrine, that
				   sinners flatter themselves with the hope of future impunity.
				
				   1. We are so taught in the word of God. Beside our text, you may see,
				   Deuteronomy xxix. 18, 19. "Lest there should be among you man, or
				   woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the
				   Lord our God. Lest there should he among you a root that beareth gall
				   and wormwood, "and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this
				   curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace,
				   though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to
				   thirst." Where it is supposed that they whose hearts turn away from
				   God, and are roots that bear gall and wormwood, generally bless
				   themselves in their hearts, saying, we shall have peace.
				
				   See also Psalm xlix. 17,18. "When he dieth, he shall carry nothing
				   away: His glory shall not descend after him, though while he lived, he
				   blessed his soul." And Psalm 1:21. "These things thou hast done. and I
				   kept silence: Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as
				   thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thee."
				
				   2. It is very evident, that sinners flatter themselves that they shall
				   escape punishment, by this, that otherwise they would be in dreadful
				   and continual distress. Otherwise, as long as they are in sin, they
				   could never live and go about so cheerfully as they now do: Their lives
				   would be filled with sorrow and mourning, and they would be in
				   continual uneasiness and distress; as much as those that are exercised
				   with some violent pain of body. But it is evident that it is not in
				   fact so; it is apparent that men are careless and secure; that they are
				   not much concerned about future punishment, and that they cheerfully
				   pursue their business and recreations. Therefore they undoubtedly
				   flatter themselves, that they shall not be eternally miserable in hell,
				   as they are threatened in the word of God
				
				   3. It is evident that they flatter themselves with hopes that they
				   shall escape punishment, as otherwise they would certainly be
				   restrained at least from many of those sins in which they now live:
				   They would not proceed in wilful courses of sin. The transgression of
				   the wicked convinced the Psalmist, and is enough to convince every one,
				   that there is no fear of God before his eyes, and that he flatters
				   himself in his own eyes. It would be impossible for men allowedly from
				   day to day to do those very things, which they know are threatened with
				   everlasting destruction, if they did not some way encourage themselves,
				   they should nevertheless escape that destruction.
				
				   II. I shall mention some of the various ways wherein sinners flatter
				   themselves in their own eyes.
				
				   1. Some flatter themselves with a secret hope, that there is no such
				   thing as another world. They hear a great deal of preaching, and a
				   great deal of talk about hell, and about the eternal judgment; but
				   those things do not seem to them to be real. They never saw any thing
				   of them; they never saw hell, never saw the devils and damned spirits;
				   and therefore are ready to say with themselves, How do I know that
				   there is any such thing as another world? When the beasts die, there is
				   an end of them, and how do I know but that it will be so with me?
				   Perhaps all these things are nothing but the inventions of men, nothing
				   but cunningly devised fables.
				
				   Such thoughts are apt to rise in the minds of sinners, and the devil
				   sets in to enforce them. Such thoughts are an ease to them; therefore
				   they wish they were true, and that makes them the more ready to think
				   that they are indeed true. So that they are hardened in the way of sin,
				   by infidelity and atheistical thoughts. Psalm xiv. 1. " The fool hath
				   said in his heart, There is no God." Psalm xciv. 6, 7. "They slay the
				   widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, the
				   Lord shall not see; neither shall the God of Jacob regard it,"
				
				   2. Some flatter themselves that death is a great way off, and that they
				   shall hereafter have much opportunity to seek salvation; and they think
				   if they earnestly seek it, though it be a great while hence, they shall
				   obtain. Although they see no reason to conclude that they shall live
				   long, and perhaps they do not positively conclude that they shall; yet
				   it doth not come into their minds that their lives are really
				   uncertain, and that it is doubtful whether they will live another year.
				   Such a thought as this doth not take any hold of them. And although
				   they do not absolutely determine that they shall live to old age or to
				   middle age, yet they secretly flatter themselves with such an
				   imagination. They are disposed to believe so, and do so far believe it,
				   that they act upon it and run the venture of it.
				
				   Men will believe that things will be as they choose to have them,
				   without reason, and sometimes without the appearance of reason, as is
				   most apparent in this case, Psalm xlix. 11. "Their inward thought is,
				   that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to
				   all generations; they call their lands after their own names."
				
				   The prepossession and desire of men to have it so, is the principal
				   thing that makes them believe so. However, there are several other
				   things which they use as arguments to flatter themselves. Perhaps they
				   think with themselves, that since they are at present in health, or in
				   youth, or that since they are useful men, do a great deal of good, and
				   both them selves and others pray for the continuance of their lives;
				   they are not likely to be removed by death very soon.
				
				   If they shall live many years in the world, they think that it is very
				   probable they shall be converted before they die; as they expect
				   hereafter to have much more convenient opportunities to become
				   converted, than they have now. And by some means or other, they think
				   they shall get through their work before they arrive at old age.
				
				   3. Some flatter themselves that they lead moral and orderly lives, and
				   therefore think that they shall not be damned. They think with
				   themselves that they live not in any vice, that they take care to wrong
				   no man, are just and honest dealers, that they are not addicted to hard
				   drinking, or to uncleanness, or to bad language; that they keep the
				   Sabbath strictly, are constant attendants on the public worship, and
				   maintain the worship of God in their families. Therefore they hope that
				   God will not cast them into hell. They see not why God should be so
				   angry with them as that would imply, seeing they are so orderly and
				   regular in their walk; they see not that they have done enough to anger
				   him to that degree. And if they have angered him, they imagine they
				   have also done a great deal to pacify him.
				
				   If they be not as yet converted, and it be necessary that they should
				   experience any other conversion in order to their salvation, they hope
				   that their orderly and strict lives will move God to give them
				   converting grace. They hope that surely God will not see those that
				   live as they do go to hell. Thus they flatter themselves, as those we
				   read of. Luke xviii. 9. "That trusted in themselves that they were
				   righteous."
				
				   4. Some make the advantages under which they live an occasion of self
				   flattery. They flatter themselves, because they live in a place where
				   the gospel is powerfully preached and among a religious people, where
				   many have been converted; and they think it will be much easier for
				   them to be saved on that account. Thus they abuse the grace of God to
				   their destruction; they do that which the scriptures call despising the
				   riches of God's goodness: Romans ii. 4. "Or despisest thou the riches
				   of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering; not knowing that
				   the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?"
				
				   Some flatter themselves, because they are born of godly parents, who
				   are dear to God, who have often and earnestly prayed for them, they
				   hope that their prayers will be heard; and that encourages them to go
				   on in the way of neglecting their souls. The Jews had great dependence
				   upon this, that they were the children of Abraham: John viii. 33. they
				   make their boast. "We be Abraham's seed; and in verse 39. "Abraham is
				   our father."
				
				   5. Some flatter themselves with their own intentions. They intend to
				   neglect themselves, and give themselves liberty for a while longer, and
				   then to reform. Though now they neglect their souls, and are going on
				   in sin; yet they intend ere long to bestir themselves, to leave off
				   their sins, and to set themselves to seek God. They hear that there is
				   great encouragement for those who earnestly seek God, that they shall
				   find him. So they intend to do; they propose to seek with a great deal
				   of earnestness. They are told, that there are many who seek to enter
				   the kingdom of heaven, who shall not be able; but they intend, not only
				   to seek, but To STRIVE However, for the present they allow themselves
				   in their ease, sloth, and pleasure, minding only earthly things.
				
				   Or if they should be seized with some mortal distemper, and should draw
				   near to the grave, before the time which they lay out in their minds
				   for reformation, they think how earnestly they would pray and cry to
				   God for mercy; and as they hear God is a merciful God, who taketh no
				   delight in the death of sinners, they hence flatter themselves that
				   they shall move God to have pity on them.
				
				   There are but few who are sinners, and know themselves to be such, who
				   do not encourage themselves with intentions of future repentance and
				   reformation; but few who do not flatter themselves, that they shall in
				   good earnest set themselves to seek God some time or other. Hell is
				   full of GOOD INTENDERS who never proved to be TRUE PERFORMERS: Acts
				   xxiv. 25. "Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I
				   will call for thee."
				
				   6. There are some who flatter themselves, that they do and have done, a
				   great deal for their salvation, and therefore hope they shall obtain,
				   when indeed they neither do what they ought to do, nor what they might
				   do in their present state of unregeneracy; nor are they in any likely
				   way to be converted They think they are striving, when they neglect
				   many moral and some instituted duties; nor do they exert themselves as
				   if it were for their lives; they are not violent for the kingdom of
				   leaven.
				
				   There are doubtless many such; many are concerned, and are seeking, and
				   do many things, and think that they are in a very fair way to obtain
				   the kingdom of God; yet there is great danger that thy will prove at
				   last to be some of the foolish virgins, and be found without oil in
				   their vessels.
				
				   7. Some hope by their strivings to obtain salvation of themselves. They
				   have a secret imagination, that they shall, by degrees, work in
				   themselves sorrow and repentance of sin, and love towards God and Jesus
				   Christ. Their striving is not so much an earnest seeking to God, as a
				   striving to do them selves that which is the work of God. Many who are
				   now seeking have this imagination, and labor, reach, pray, hear sermons
				   and go to private meetings, with the view of making themselves holy,
				   and of working in themselves holy affections.
				
				   Many, who only project and design to turn to God hereafter, are apt to
				   think that it is an easy thing to be converted, that it is a thing
				   which will be in their own power at any time, when they shall earnestly
				   set themselves to it.
				
				   8. Some sinners flatter themselves that they are already converted.
				   They sit down and rest in a false hope, persuading themselves that all
				   their sins are pardoned; that God loves them; that they shall go to
				   heaven when they die; and that they need trouble themselves no more:
				   Revelation iii. 17. "Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with
				   goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art
				   wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."
				
				   III. Sinners very generally go on flattering themselves in some or
				   other of these ways, till their punishment actually overtakes them.
				   These are the baits by which Satan catches souls, and draws them into
				   his snare. They are such self flatteries as these that keep men from
				   seeing what danger they are in, and that make them go securely on in
				   the way they are in, "as the bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not
				   that it is for his life."
				
				   Those that flatter themselves with hopes of living a great while longer
				   in the world, very commonly continue so to do till death comes. Death
				   comes upon them when they expect it not; they look upon it as a great
				   way off, when there is but a step between them and death. They thought
				   not of dying at that time, nor at anytime near it. When they were
				   young, they proposed to live a good while longer; and if they happen to
				   live till middle age, they still maintain the same thought, that they
				   are not yet near death; and so that thought goes along with them as
				   long as they live, or till they are just about to die.
				
				   Men often have a dependence on their own righteousness, and as long as
				   they live are never brought off from it. Multitudes uphold themselves
				   with their own intentions, till all their prospects are dashed in
				   pieces by death. They put off the work which they have to do till such
				   a time; and when that comes, they put it off to another time, until
				   death, which cannot be put off, overtakes them. There are many also
				   that hold a false hope, a persuasion that they belong to God; and as
				   long as they live, by all the marks and signs which are given of a true
				   convert, they never will be persuaded to let go their hope, till it is
				   rent from them by death.
				
				   Thus men commonly uphold themselves, and make themselves easy, till
				   hell fire makes them uneasy. Everlasting ruin comes upon them as a
				   snare, and all their hopes are at once cut off, and turned into
				   everlasting despair: I. Thessalonians v. 3. "When they shall say, Peace
				   and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
				   woman with child; and they shall not escape."
				
				  APPLICATION
				
				   1. Hence we learn one reason why there are but few saved, and why so
				   many perish from under the gospel. All men know that they must die, and
				   all that sit under the light of the gospel have been told many a time,
				   that after this there is an other world; that there are but two states
				   in that other world, a state of eternal happiness, and a state of
				   eternal misery; that there is but one way of escaping the misery and
				   obtaining the blessedness of eternity, which is by obtaining an
				   interest in Christ, through faith in him; and that this life is the
				   only opportunity of obtaining an interest in Christ. Yet men are so
				   much given to flatter themselves in those ways which we have mentioned,
				   that there are but few that seasonably take care of their salvation.
				   Indeed they cannot but be in some measure concerned about their souls;
				   yet they flatter themselves with one thing or other, so that they are
				   kept steadily and uninterruptedly going on in the broad way to
				   destruction.
				
				   2. Hence we learn the reason why awakening truths of scripture, and
				   awakening sermons, make no more impression upon men. It is in itself a
				   wonderful and surprising thing, that God's denunciations of eternal
				   misery, and threatenings of casting sinners into the lake that burneth
				   with fire and brimstone for ever and ever, do not affect them, do not
				   startle them. But the truth is, they flatter themselves, by such means
				   as we have mentioned, that this dreadful misery is not for them; that
				   they shall escape it, though multitudes of others are involved in it.
				   They take not these threatenings to themselves; they seem to think that
				   they do not belong to them.
				
				   How many are there in this congregation, who, for all the awakening
				   sermons they have heard, are yet secure in sin! And who, although they
				   are sensible that they are in a Christless condition, and are still
				   going on in sin, yet intend to go to heaven, and expect that by some
				   means or other they shall arrive there. They are often told, that God
				   is very angry with them; yet they think God is a very merciful God, and
				   they shall be able to pacify him. If they be told how uncertain life
				   is, that doth not awaken them, because they flatter themselves with
				   long life. If they be told how dangerous it is to delay the business of
				   religion, they promise themselves, that they will hereafter engage in
				   it with more earnestness than others, and so obtain the end, the
				   salvation of their souls. Others, when they are told that many shall
				   seek who shall not he able to obtain, think surely, that they, having
				   done so much for salvation, shall not be denied.
				
				   3. Let every sinner examine himself, whether he do not flatter himself
				   in some of those ways which have been mentioned. What is it in your own
				   minds which makes you think it is safe for you to delay turning to God?
				   What is it that encourages you to run such a venture as you do by
				   delaying this necessary work? Is it that you hope there is no such
				   state as heaven or hell, and have a suspicion that there is no God ? Is
				   It this that makes you secure ? Or is it that you are not much afraid
				   but that you shall have opportunity enough a great while hence to mind
				   such things? Is it an intention of a future seeking a more convenient
				   season? And are you persuaded that God will hearken to you then, after
				   you shall have so long turned a deaf ear to his commands and gracious?
				   Are you encouraged to commit sin, because you hope to repent of it? Are
				   you encouraged by the mercy of God to be his enemies? And do you
				   resolve still to provoke him to anger, because you think he is easily
				   pacified ?
				
				   Or do you think that your conversion is in your own power, and that you
				   can turn to God when you please? Is it because you have been born of
				   godly parents that you are so secure? Or do you imagine that you are in
				   a fair way to be converted? Do you think that what you have done in
				   religion will engage God to pity you, and that he never can have the
				   heart to condemn one who has lived in so orderly a manner? Or do you
				   think that you are indeed converted already? And doth that encourage
				   you to take a liberty in sinning ? Or are you secure, because you are
				   so stupid as to think nothing about these things? Do you let these
				   concerns wholly alone, and scarcely ever think at all how it will be
				   with you after you are dead?
				
				   Certainly it must be one or more of these things which keeps you in
				   your security, and encourages you to go on in sin. Examine, therefore,
				   and see which of them it is.
				
				   4. By the text and doctrine be persuaded to leave off thus flattering
				   yourselves in your own eyes. You are therein informed, that those who
				   do as you do commonly continue so doing till their punishment actually
				   comes upon them. Thereby you may be convinced of the vanity of all such
				   flatteries. Be afraid of that which you are sure is the devil's bait:
				   "Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird," Proverbs
				   i. 17.
				
				   You are not only told in the scriptures, that sinners are generally
				   thus allured to hell, but your own reason may convince you that it is
				   so. For doubtless other sinners have as much ground to hope to escape
				   punishment as you; and it is evident, that they generally do hope to
				   escape. Men under the gospel almost universally think they shall not go
				   to hell: If it were otherwise, they could have no peace or comfort in
				   the world. Yet what multitudes have we reason to conclude go down from
				   under the preaching of the gospel to the pit of destruction! Now, this
				   is surely enough to convince any sober, prudent person of the folly of
				   such flattery, and of the folly of every one that doth not immediately
				   set about his great work with his might. If you could have access to
				   the damned, you would hear many of them curse themselves, for thus
				   flattering themselves while they lived in this world; and you would
				   have the same doctrine preached to you by their wailings and yellings
				   which is now preached to you from the pulpit.
				
				   If your temptation to security be unbelief of the fundamental doctrines
				   of religion, such as the being of God, of another world, and an eternal
				   judgment, you may consider, that though that makes you secure at
				   present, yet it will not do always, it will not stand by when you come
				   to die. The fool often in health saith, There is no God; but when he
				   comes to die, he cannot rest in any such supposition. Then he is
				   generally so much convinced in his own conscience, that there is a God,
				   that he is in dreadful amazement for fear of his eternal wrath. It is
				   folly, therefore, to flatter yourselves with any supposition now which
				   you will not then be able to hold.
				
				   If you depend on long life, consider how many who have depended on the
				   same thing, and had as much reason to depend on it as you, have died
				   within your remembrance.
				
				   Is it because you are outwardly of an orderly life and conversation,
				   that you think you shall be saved ? How unreasonable is it to suppose,
				   that God should be so obliged by those actions, which he knows are not
				   done from the least respect or regard to him, but wholly with a private
				   view! Is it because you are under great advantages that you are not
				   much afraid but that you shall some time or other be converted, and
				   therefore neglect yourselves and your spiritual interests? And were not
				   the people of Bethsaida, Chorazin and Capernaum, under as great
				   advantages as you, when Christ himself preached the gospel to them,
				   almost continually, and wrought such a multitude of miracles among
				   them? Yet he says, that it shall be more tolerable in the day of
				   judgment for Sodom and Gomorrah, than for those cities.
				
				   Do you expect you shall be saved, however you neglect yourselves,
				   because you were born of godly parents? hear what Christ saith, Matthew
				   iii. 9. ''Think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our
				   father." Do you flatter yourselves that you shall obtain mercy, though
				   others do not, because you intend hereafter to seek it more earnestly
				   than others? Yet you deceive yourselves, if you think that you intend
				   better than many of those others, or better than many who are now in
				   hell once intended.
				
				   If you think you are in a way of earnest seeking, consider, whether or
				   no you do not mind other things yet more? If you imagine that you have
				   it in your own power to work yourselves up to repentance, consider,
				   that you must assuredly give up that imagination before you can have
				   repentance wrought in you. If you think yourselves already converted,
				   and that encourages you to give yourselves the greater liberty in
				   sinning, this is a certain sign that you are not converted.
				
				   Wherefore abandon all these ways of flattering yourselves; no longer
				   follow the devil's bait; and let nothing encourage you to go on in sin;
				   but immediately and henceforth seek God with all your heart, and soul,
				   and strength.

				THE FUTURE PUNISHMENT OF THE WICKED
				UNAVOIDABLE AND INTOLERABLE
				
				    Ezekiel 22:14 -- Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong in the
				    days that I shall deal with thee? I the Lord save spoken it, and will do it.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   IN the former part of this chapter, we have a dreadful catalogue of the
				   sins of Jerusalem; as you may see from the first to the thirteenth
				   verse. In the thirteenth, which is the verse preceeding the text, God
				   manifests his great displeasure and fearful wrath against them for
				   those their iniquities. "Behold, I have smitten mine hand at thy
				   dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been
				   in the midst of thee." The expression of God's smiting his hand,
				   signifies the greatness of his anger, and his preparing himself, as it
				   were to execute wrath answerable to their heinous crimes. It is an
				   allusion to what we sometimes see in men when they are surprised, by
				   seeing or hearing of some horrid offence, or most intolerable injury,
				   which very much stirs their spirits, and animates them with high
				   resentment; on such an occasion they will rise up in wrath and smite
				   their hands together, as an expression of the heat of their
				   indignation, and full resolution to be avenged on those who have
				   committed the injury; as in chap. xxi. 7. " I will also smite mine
				   hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the Lord have said
				   it,"
				
				   Then, in the text, the punishment of that people is represented.
				
				   1. The nature of their punishment is more generally represented in that
				   therein God will undertake to deal with them: God here threatens to
				   deal with the sinners in Jerusalem. The prophets could do nothing with
				   them. God had sent them one after another; but those sinners were too
				   strong for them, and beat one, and killed another. Therefore now God
				   himself undertakes to deal with them.
				
				   2. Their punishment is more particularly represented in three things,
				   viz. The intolerableness, the remedilessness, and the unavoidableness
				   of it.
				
				   (1.) The intolerableness of it: Can thine heart endure?
				   (2.) The remedilessness, or the impossibility of their doing any thing
				   for their own relief: Can thine hands be strong?
				   (3.) The unavoidableness of it: I the Lord have spoken it, and will do
				   it.
				
				  DOCTRINE
				
				   Since God hath undertaken to deal with impenitent sinners, they shall
				   neither shun the threatened misery, nor deliver themselves out of it,
				   nor can they bear it.
				
				   In handling this doctrine, I shall,
				
				   1. Show what is implied in God's undertaking to deal with inpenitent
				   sinners.
				   2. That therefore they cannot avoid punishment.
				   3. That they cannot in any measure deliver themselves from it, or do
				   any thing for their own relief under it.
				   4. That they cannot bear it.
				   5. I shall answer an inquiry; and then proceed to the use.
				
				   I. I shall show what is implied in God's undertaking to deal with
				   impenitent sinners...Others are not able to deal with them. They baffle
				   all the means used with them by those that are appointed to teach and
				   to rule over them. They will not yield to parents, or to the counsels,
				   warning, or reproofs of ministers. They prove obstinate and
				   stiff-hearted. Therefore God undertakes to deal with them This implies
				   the following things:
				
				   1. That God will reckon with them, and take of them satisfaction to his
				   justice. In this world God puts forth his authority to command them;
				   and to require subjection to him. In his commands he is very positive,
				   strictly requiring of them the performance of such and such duties, and
				   as positively forbidding such and such things which were contrary to
				   their duty. But they have no regard to these commands. God continues
				   commanding, and they continue rebelling. They make nothing of God's
				   authority. God threatens, but they despise his threatening They make
				   nothing of dishonoring God; they care not how much their behavior is to
				   the dishonor of God. He offers them mercy, if they will repent and
				   return; but they despise his mercy as well as his wrath. God calleth,
				   but they refuse. Thus they are continually plunging themselves deeper
				   and deeper in debt, and at the same time imagine they shall escape the
				   payment of the debt, and design entirely to rob God of his due.
				
				   But God hath undertaken to right himself. He will reckon with them; he
				   hath undertaken to see that the debts due to him are paid. All their
				   sins are written in his book; not one of them is forgotten, and every
				   one must be paid. If God be wise enough, and strong enough, he will
				   have full satisfaction: he will exact the very uttermost farthing. He
				   undertakes it as his part, as what belongs to him, to see himself
				   righted, wherein he hath been wronged Deut. xxii. 35. "To me belongeth
				   vengeance." Ibid. vii. 10. "He will not be slack to him that hateth
				   him; he will repay him to his face."
				
				   2. He hath undertaken to vindicate the honor of his Majesty. His
				   Majesty they despise. They hear that he is a great God; but they
				   despise his greatness; they look upon him worthy of contempt, and treat
				   him accordingly. They hear of him by the name of a great King; but his
				   authority they regard not, and sometimes trample upon it for years
				   together. But God hath not left the honor of his Majesty wholly to
				   their care. Though they now trample it in the dust, yet that is no sign
				   that it will finally be lost. If God had left it wholly in their hands,
				   it would indeed be lost. But God doth not leave his honor and his glory
				   with his enemies; it is too precious in his eyes to be so neglected. He
				   hath reserved the care of it to himself: He will see to it that his own
				   injured Majesty is vindicated. If the honor of God, upon which sinners
				   trample, finally lie in the dust, then it will be because he is not
				   strong enough to vindicate himself. He hath sworn that great oath in
				   Numbers xiv. 2 1. "As truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled
				   with the glory of the Lord."
				
				   Sinners despise his Son, and trample him under their feet. But he will
				   see, if he cannot make the glory of his Son appear, with respect to
				   them; that all the earth may know how evil a thing it is to despise the
				   Son of God. God intends that all men and angels, all heaven and all
				   earth, shall see whether he be sufficient to magnify himself upon
				   sinners who now despise him. He intends that the issue of things with
				   respect to them shall be open, that all men may see it.
				
				   3. He hath undertaken to subdue impenitent sinners. Their hearts while
				   in this world are very unsubdued. They lift up their heads and conduct
				   themselves very proudly and contemptuously, and often sin with an high
				   hand. They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues walk
				   through the earth. They practically say as Pharaoh did, "Who is the
				   Lord? I know not the Lord, neither will I obey his voice." Job xxi. 4
				   1. "They say to God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of
				   thy ways."
				
				   Some, who cover their sin with specious show, who put on a face of
				   religion, and a demure countenance and behavior, yet have this spirit
				   secretly reigning in their breasts. Notwithstanding all their fair
				   show, and good external carriage, they despise God in their hearts, and
				   have the weapons of war about them, though they are secret enemies, and
				   carry their swords under their skirts. They have most proud, stubborn,
				   and rebellious hearts, which are ready to rise in opposition, to
				   contend with him, and to find fault with his dispensations. Their
				   hearts are full of pride, enmity, stubbornness, and blasphemy, which
				   work in them many ways, while they sit under the preaching of the word,
				   and while the spirit of God is striving with them; and they always
				   continue to oppose and resist God as long as they live in the world;
				   they never lay down the weapons of their rebellion."
				
				   But God hath undertaken to deal with them and to subdue them; and those
				   proud and stubborn hearts, which will not yield to the power of God's
				   word, shall be broken by the power of his hand. If they will not be
				   willing subjects to the golden sceptre, and will not yield to the
				   attractives of his love, they shall be subject to the force of the iron
				   rod, whether they will or no.
				
				   Them that proudly set up their own righteousness, and their own wills
				   against God, God hath undertaken to bring down; and without doubt, it
				   will be done. He hath undertaken to make those who are now regardless
				   of God, regard him. They shall know that he is Jehovah. Now they will
				   not own that he is the Lord; but they shall know it, Isa. xxvi. 11.
				   "Lord, when thine hand is lifted up, they will not see: But they shall
				   see."
				
				   Now wicked men not only hate God, but they slight him; they are not
				   afraid of him. But, he will subdue their contempt. When he shall come
				   to take them in hand, they will hate him still; but they will not
				   slight him; they will not make light of his power as they now do; they
				   will see and feel too much of the infinity of his power to slight it
				   They are now wont to slight his wrath; but then they will slight it no
				   more, they will be infinitely far from it, they will find by sufficient
				   experience that his wrath is not to be slighted: They will learn this
				   to their cost, and they never will forget it.
				
				   4. God hath undertaken to rectify their judgments. Now they will not be
				   convinced of those things which God tells them in his word. Ministers
				   take much pains to convince them, but all is in vain. Therefore God
				   will undertake to convince them, and he will do it effectually. Now
				   they will not be convinced of the truth of divine things. They have
				   indeed convincing arguments set before them; they hear and see enough
				   to convince them; yet so prone are they to unbelief and Atheism, that
				   divine things never seem to them to be real. But God will hereafter
				   make them seem real.
				
				   Now they are always doubting of the truth of the Scriptures,
				   questioning whether they be the word of God, and whether the
				   threatenings of Scripture be true. but God hath undertaken to convince
				   them that those threatenings are true, and he will make them to know
				   that they are true, so that they will never doubt any more for ever.
				   They will be convinced by dear experience....Now they are always
				   questioning whether there be any such place as hell. They hear much
				   about it, but it always seems to them like a dream. But God will make
				   it seem otherwise than a dream....Now they are often told of the vanity
				   of the world; but we may as well preach to the beasts, to persuade them
				   of the vanity of earthly things. But God will undertake to convince
				   them of this; he will hereafter give them a thorough conviction of it,
				   so that they shall have a strong sense of the vanity of all these
				   things.
				
				   Now ministers often tell sinners of the great importance of an interest
				   in Christ, and that that is the one thing needful. They are also told
				   the folly of delaying the care of their souls, and how much it concerns
				   them to improve their opportunity. But the instructions of ministers do
				   not convince them, therefore God will undertake to convince them.
				   Impenitent sinners, while in this world, hear how dreadful hell is. But
				   they will not believe that it is so dreadful as ministers represent.
				   They cannot think that they shall to all eternity suffer such exquisite
				   and horrible torments. But they shall be taught and convinced to
				   purpose, that the representations ministers give of those torments,
				   agreeable to the word of God, are no bugbears; and that the wrath of
				   God is indeed as dreadful as they declare. Since God hath undertaken to
				   deal with sinners, and to rectify their judgments in these matters, and
				   he will do it thoroughly; for his work is perfect; when he undertakes
				   to do things, he doth not do them by halves; therefore before he shall
				   have done with sinners, be will convince them effectually, so that they
				   shall never be in danger of relapsing into their former errors any
				   more. He will convince them of their folly and stupidity in
				   entertaining such notions as they now entertain.
				
				   Thus God hath undertaken to deal with obstinate unbelievers. They carry
				   things on in great confusion; but we need not be dismayed at it: Let us
				   wait, and we shall see that God will rectify things. Sinners will not
				   always continue to rebel and despise with impunity. The honor of God
				   will in due time be vindicated; and they shall be subdued and
				   convicted, and shall give an account. There is no sin, not so much as
				   an idle word that they shall speak, but they must give an account of
				   it; Matth. xii 36. And their sins must be fully balanced, and
				   recompensed, and satisfaction obtained. Because judgment against their
				   evil works is not speedily executed, their hearts are fully set in them
				   to do evil. Yet God is a righteous judge; he will see that judgment is
				   executed in due time.
				
				   I come now,
				
				   II. To show, that therefore impenitent sinners shall not avoid their
				   due punishment....God hath undertaken to inflict it; he hath engaged to
				   do it; he takes it as his work, as what properly belongs to him, and we
				   may expect it of him. If he hath sworn by his life, that he will do it;
				   and if he hath power sufficient; if he is the living God, doubtless we
				   shall see it done. And that God hath declared that he will punish
				   impenitent sinners, is manifest from, many scriptures; as Deut.
				   xxxii.41. "I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward
				   them that hate me." Deut. vii. 10. "He will not be slack to him that
				   hateth him: He will repay him to his face." Exod. xxxiv. 7. "That will
				   by no means clear the guilty." Nahum i. 3. "The Lord is slow to anger,
				   and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked."
				   God saith in the text, "I the Lord hath spoken it, and will do it;"
				   which leaves no room to doubt of the actual fulfilment of the
				   threatening in its utmost extent....Some wicked men have flattered
				   themselves, that although God hath threatened very dreadful things to
				   wicked men for their sins, yet in his heart he never intends to fulfil
				   his threatenings, but only to terrify them, and make them afraid, while
				   they live. But would the infinitely holy God, who is not a man that he
				   should lie, and who speaketh no vain words, utter himself in this
				   manner: I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it; I have not only
				   threatened, but I will also fufill my threatenings; when at the same
				   time these words did not agree with his heart, but he secretly knew
				   that though he had spoken, yet he intended not to do it? Who is he that
				   dares to entertain such horrid blasphemy in his heart?
				
				   No; let no impenitent sinner flatter himself so vainly and foolishly.
				   If it were indeed only a man, a being of like impotency and mutability
				   with themselves, who had undertaken to deal with them; they might
				   perhaps with some reason flatter themselves; that they should find some
				   means to avoid the threatened punishment. But since an omniscient,
				   omnipotent, immutable God hath undertaken, vain are all such hopes.
				
				   There is no hope that possibly they may steal away to heaven, though
				   they die unconverted. There is no hope that they can deceive God by any
				   false show of repentance and faith, and so be taken to heaven through
				   mistake; for the eyes of God are as a flame of fire; they perfectly see
				   through every man; the inmost closet of the heart is all open to him
				
				   There is no hope of escaping the threatened punishment by sinking into
				   nothing at death, like brute creatures Indeed, many wicked men upon
				   their deathbeds wish for this. If it were so, death would be nothing to
				   them in comparison with what it now is. But all such wishes are vain.
				
				   There is no hope of their escaping without notice, when they leave the
				   body. There is no hope that God, by reason of the multiplicity of
				   affairs which ho hath to mind, will happen to overlook them, and not
				   take notice of them, when they come to die; and so that their souls
				   will slip away privately, and hide themselves in some secret corner,
				   and so escape divine vengeance.
				
				   There is no hope that they shall be missed in a crowd at the day of
				   judgment, and that they can have opportunity to hide themselves in some
				   cave or den of the mountains, or in any secret hole of the earth; and
				   that while so doing, they will not be minded, by reason of the many
				   things which will be the objects of attention on that day....Neither is
				   there any hope that they will be able to crowd themselves in among the
				   multitude of the saints at the right hand of the Judge, and so go to
				   heaven undiscovered....Nor is there any hope that God will alter his
				   mind, or that he will repent of what he hath said; for he is not the
				   son of man that lie should repent. Hath he said, and shall he not do
				   it? Hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? When did God ever
				   undertake to do any thing and fail?
				
				   I come now,
				
				   III. To show, that as impenitent sinners cannot shun the threatened
				   punishment; so neither can they do any thing to deliver themselves from
				   it, or to relieve themselves under it. This is implied in those words
				   of the text, Can thine hand. be strong? It is with our hands that we
				   make and accomplish things for ourselves. But the wicked in hell will
				   have no strength of hand to accomplish any thing at all for themselves,
				   or to bring to pass any deliverance, or any degree of relief.
				
				   1. They will not he able in that conflict to overcome their enemy, and
				   so to deliver themselves. God, who will then undertake to deal with
				   them, and will gird himself with might to execute wrath, will be their
				   enemy, and will act the part of an enemy with a witness; and they will
				   have no strength to oppose him. Those who live negligent of their souls
				   under the light of the gospel, act as if they supposed, that they
				   should be able here after to make their part good with God. 1 Cor. x.
				   22. "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he
				   ?"...But they will have no power, no might to resist that omnipotence,
				   which will be engaged against them.
				
				   2. They will have no strength in their hands to do any thing to appease
				   God, or in the least to abate the fierceness of his wrath. They will
				   not be able to offer any satisfaction: they will not be able to procure
				   God's pity. Though they cry, God will not hear them. They will find no
				   price to offer to God, in order to purchase any favor, or to pay any
				   part of their debt.
				
				   3. They will not be able to find any to befriend them, and intercede
				   with God for them. They had the offer of a mediator often made them in
				   this world; but they will have no offers of such a nature in hell. None
				   will befriend them. They will have no friend in HELL; all there will be
				   their enemies. They will have no friend in heaven: 'None of the saints
				   or angels will befriend them; or if they should, it would be to no
				   purpose. There will be no creature that will have any power to dellver
				   them, nor will any ever pity them.
				
				   4. Nor will they ever be able to make their escape. They will find no
				   means to break prison and flee. In hell, they will be reserved in
				   chains of darkness for ever and ever. Malefactors have often found
				   means to break prison, and escape the hand of, civil justice. But none
				   ever escaped out of the prison of hell, which is God's prison. It is a
				   strong prison: it is beyond any finite power, or the united strength of
				   all wicked men and devils, to unlock, or break open the door of that
				   prison. Christ hath the key of hell; "he shuts and no man opens."
				
				   5. Nor will they ever be able to find any thing to relieve them in
				   hell. They will never find any resting place there; any place of
				   respite; any secret corner, which will be cooler than the rest, where
				   they may have a little respite, a small abatement of the extremity of
				   their torment. They never will be able to find any cooling stream or
				   fountain, in any part of that world of torment; no, nor so much as a
				   drop of water to cool their tongues. They will find no company to give
				   them any comfort, or to do them the least good. They will find no
				   place, where they can remain, and rest, and take breath for one minute:
				   For they will be tormented with fire and brimstone; and will have no
				   rest day nor night for ever and ever.
				
				   Thus impenitent sinners will be able neither to shun the punishment
				   threatened, nor to deliver themselves from it, nor to find any relief
				   under it.
				
				   I come now,
				
				   IV. To show, that neither will they be able to bear it. Neither will
				   their bands be strong to deliver t}themselves from it, nor will their
				   hearts be able to endure it. It is common with men, when they meet with
				   calamities in this world, in the first place to endeavor to shun them.
				   But if they find, that they cannot shun them, then after they are come,
				   they endeavor to deliver themselves from them as soon as they can; or
				   at least, to order things so, as to deliver themselves in some degree.
				   But if they find that they can by no means deliver themselves, and see
				   that the case is so that they must bear them; then they set themselves
				   to bear them: they fortify their spirits, and take up a resolution,
				   that they will support themselves under them as well as they can.
				
				   But it will be utterly in vain for impenitent sinners to think to do
				   thus with respect to the torments of hell. They will not be able to
				   endure them, or at all to support themselves under them: the torment
				   will be immensely beyond their strength. What will it signify for a
				   worm, which is about to be pressed under the weight of some great rock,
				   to be let fall with its whole weight upon it, to collect its strength,
				   to set itself to bear up the weight of the rock, and to preserve itself
				   from being crushed by it? Much more in vain will it be for a poor
				   damned soul, to endeavor to support itself under the weight of the
				   wrath of Almighty God. What is the strength of man, who is but a worm,
				   to support himself against the power of Jehovah, and against the
				   fierceness of his wrath? What is man's strength, when set to bear up
				   against the exertions of infinite power? Matt. xxi. 44, "Whosoever
				   shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall
				   fall, it will grind him to powder."
				
				   When sinners hear of hell torments, they sometimes think with
				   themselves: Well, if it shall come to that, that I must go to hell, I
				   will bear it as well as I can: as if by clothing themselves with
				   resolution and firmness of mind, they would be able to support
				   themselves in some measure; when, alas! they will have no resolution,
				   no courage at all. However they shall have prepared themselves, and
				   collected their strength; yet as soon as they shall begin to feel that
				   wrath, their hearts will melt and be as water. However before they may
				   seem to harden their hearts, in order to prepare themselves to bear,
				   yet the first moment they feel it, their hearts will become like wax
				   before the furnace. Their courage and resolution will be all gone in an
				   instant; it will vanish away like a shadow in the twinkling of an eye.
				   The stoutest and most sturdy will have no more courage than the
				   feeblest infant: let a man be an infant, or a giant, it will be all
				   one. They will not be able to keep alive any courage, any strength, any
				   comfort, any hope at all.
				
				   I come now as was proposed,
				
				   V. To answer an inquiry which may naturally be raised concerning these
				   things.
				
				   Inquiry. Some may be ready to say, If this be the case, if impenitent
				   sinners can neither shun future punishment, nor deliver themselves from
				   it, nor bear it; then what will become of them?
				
				   Answer. They will wholly sink down into eternal death. There will be
				   that sinking of heart, of which we now cannot conceive. We see how it
				   is with the body when in extreme pain. The nature of the body will
				   support itself for a considerable time under very great pain, so as to
				   keep from wholly sinking. There will be great struggles, lamentable
				   groans and panting, and it may be convulsions. These are the
				   strugglings of nature to support itself under the extremity of the
				   pain. There is, as it were, a great lothness in nature to yield to it;
				   it cannot bear wholly to sink.
				
				   But yet sometimes pain of body is so very extreme and exquisite, that
				   the nature of the body cannot support itself under it; however loth it
				   may be to sink, yet it cannot bear the pain; there are a few struggles,
				   and throes, and pantings, and it may be a shriek or two, and then
				   nature yields to the violence of the torments, sinks down, and the body
				   dies. This is the death of the body. So it will be with the soul in
				   hell; it will have no strength or power to deliver itself and its
				   torment and horror will be so great, so mighty, so vastly
				   disproportioned to its strength, that having no strength in the least
				   to support itself, although it be infinitely contrary to the nature and
				   inclination of the soul utterly to sink; yet it will sink, it will
				   utterly and totally sink, without the least degree of remaining
				   comfort, or strength, or courage, or hope. And though it will never be
				   annihilated, its being and perception will never be abolished, yet such
				   will be the infinite depth of gloominess that it will sink into, that
				   it will be in a state of death, eternal death.
				
				   The nature of man desires happiness; it is the nature of the soul to
				   crave and thirst after well-being; and if it be under misery, it
				   eagerly pants after relief; and the greater the misery is, the more
				   eagerly doth it struggle for help. But if all relief be withholden, all
				   strength overborne, all support utterly gone; then it sinks into the
				   darkness of death.
				   We can conceive but little of the matter; we cannot conceive what that
				   sinking of the soul in such a case is. But to help your conception,
				   imagine yourself to be cast into a fiery oven, or of a great furnace,
				   where your pain would be as much greater than that occasioned by
				   accidentally touching a coal of fire, as the heat is greater. Imagine
				   also that your body were to lie there for a quarter of an hour, all the
				   while full of quick sense; what horror would you feel at the entrance
				   of such a furnace! And how long would that quarter of an hour seem to
				   you! And after you had endured it for one minute, how overbearing would
				   it be to you to think that you had it to endure the other fourteen!
				
				   But what would be the effect on your soul, if you knew you must lie
				   there enduring that torment to the full for twenty-four hours! And how
				   much greater would be the effect, if you knew you must endure it for a
				   whole year; and how vastly greater still, if you knew you must endure
				   it for a thousand years! O then, how would your heart sink, if you
				   thought, if you knew, that you must bear it forever and ever! That
				   there would be no end! That after millions of millions of ages, your
				   torment would be no nearer to an end, than ever it was; and that you
				   never, never should be delivered!
				
				   But your torment in hell will be immensely greater than this
				   illustration represents. How then will the heart of a poor creature
				   sink under it! How utterly inexpressible and inconceivable must the
				   sinking of the soul be in such a case!
				   This is the death threatened in the law. This is dying in the highest
				   sense of the word. This is to die sensibly; to die and know it; to be
				   sensible of the gloom of death. This is to be undone; this is worthy of
				   the name of destruction. This sinking of the soul under an infinite
				   weight, which it cannot bear, is the gloom of hell. We read in
				   Scripture of the blackness of darkness; this is it, this is the very
				   thing. We read in Scripture of sinners being lost, and of their losing
				   their souls: this is the thing intended; this is to lose the soul: they
				   that are the subjects of this are utterly lost.
				
				  APPLICATION
				
				   This subject may be applied in a use of awakening to impenitent
				   sinners. What hath been said under this doctrine is for thee, O
				   impenitent sinner, O poor wretch, who art in the same miserable state
				   in which thou camest into the world, excepting that thou art loaded
				   with vastly greater guilt by thine actual sins. These dreadful things
				   which thou hast heard are for thee, who art yet unconverted, and still
				   remainest an alien and stranger, without Christ and without God in the
				   world. They are for thee, who to this day remainest an enemy to God,
				   and a child of the devil, even in this remarkable season, when others
				   both here and elsewhere, far and near, are flocking to Christ; for thee
				   who hearest the noise, the fame of these things, but knowest nothing of
				   the power of godliness in thine own heart.
				
				   Whoever thou art, whether young or old, little or great, if thou art in
				   a Christless, unconverted state, this is the wrath, this is the death
				   to which thou art condemned. This is the wrath that abideth on thee;
				   this is the hell over which thou hangest, and into which thou art ready
				   to drop every day and every night.
				
				   If thou shalt remain blind, and hard, and dead in sin a little longer,
				   this destruction will come upon thee: God hath spoken and he will do
				   it. It is vain for thee to flatter thyself with hopes that thou shalt
				   avoid it, or to say in thine heart, perhaps it will not be; perhaps it
				   will not be just so; perhaps things have been represented worse than
				   they are. If thou wilt not be convinced by the word preached to thee by
				   men in the name of God, God himself will undertake to convince thee,
				   Ezekiel xiv. 4, 7, 8.
				
				   Doth it seem to thee not real that thou shalt suffer such a dreadful
				   destruction, because it seems to thee that thou dust not deserve it?
				   And because thou dust not see any thing so horrid in thyself, as to
				   answer such a dreadful punishment? Why is it that thy wickedness doth
				   not seem bad enough to deserve this punishment? The reason is, that
				   thou lovest thy wickedness; thy wickedness seems good to thee; it
				   appears lovely to thee; thou dust not see any hatefulness in it, or to
				   be sure, any such hatefulness as to answer such misery.
				
				   But know, thou stupid, blind, hardened wretch, that God doth not see,
				   as thou seest with thy polluted eyes: thy sins in his sight are
				   infinitely abominable.-Thou knowest that thou hast a thousand and a
				   thousand times made light of the Majesty of God. And why should not
				   that Majesty, which thou hast thus despised, be manifested in the
				   greatness of thy punishment? Thou hast often heard what a great and
				   dreadful God Jehovah is; but thou hast made so light of it, that thou
				   hast not been afraid of him, thou hast not been afraid to sin against
				   him, nor to go on day after day, by thy sins, to provoke him to wrath,
				   nor to cast his commands under foot, and trample on them. Now why may
				   not God, in the greatness of thy destruction, justly vindicate and
				   manifest the greatness of that Majesty, which thou hast despised?
				
				   Thou hast despised the mighty power of God; thou hast not been afraid
				   of it. Now why is it not fit that God should show the greatness of his
				   power in thy ruin? What king is there who will not show his authority
				   in the punishment of those subjects that despise it! And who will not
				   vindicate his royal majesty in executing vengeance on those that rise
				   in rebellion? And art thou such a fool as to think that the great King
				   of heaven and earth, before whom all other kings are so many
				   grasshoppers, will not vindicate his kingly Majesty on such
				   contemptuous rebels as thou art?-Thou art very much mistaken if thou
				   thinkest so. If thou be regardless of God's Majesty, be it known to
				   thee, God is not regardless of his own Majesty; he taketh care of the
				   honor of it, and he will vindicate it.
				
				   Think it not strange that God should deal so severely with thee, or
				   that the wrath which thou shalt suffer should be so great. For as great
				   as it is, it is no greater than that love of God which thou hast
				   despised. The love of God, and his grace, condescension, and pity to
				   sinners in sending his Son into the world to die for them, is every
				   whit as great and wonderful as this inexpressible wrath. This mercy
				   hath been held forth to thee, and described in its wonderful greatness
				   hundreds of times, and as often hath it been offered to thee; but thou
				   wouldst not accept Christ; thou wouldst not have this great love of
				   God; thou despisedst God's dying love; thou trampledst the benefits of
				   it under foot. Now why shouldst thou not have wrath as great as that
				   love and mercy which thou despisest and rejectest? Doth it seem
				   incredible to thee, that God should so harden his heart against a poor
				   sinner, as so to destroy him, and to bear him down with infinite power
				   and merciless wrath? And is this a greater thing than it is for thee to
				   harden thy heart, as thou hast done, against infinite mercy, and
				   against the dying love of God?
				
				   Doth it seem to thee incredible, that God should be so utterly
				   regardless of the sinner's welfare, as so to sink him into an infinite
				   abyss of misery? Is this shocking to thee? And is it not at all
				   shocking to thee, that thou shouldst be so utterly regardless as thou
				   hast been of the honor and glory of the infinite God?
				   It arises from thy foolish stupidity and senselessness, and is because
				   thou hast a heart of stone, that thou art so senseless of thine own
				   wickedness as to think thou hast not deserved such a punishment, and
				   that it is to thee incredible that it will be inflicted upon thee.-But
				   if, when all is said and done, thou be not convinced, wait but a little
				   while, and thou wilt be convinced: God will undertake to do the work
				   which ministers cannot do. -Though judgment against thine evil works be
				   not yet executed, and God now let thee alone, yet he will soon come
				   upon thee with his great power, and then thou shalt know what God is,
				   and what thou art.
				
				   Flatter not thyself, that if these things shall prove true, and the
				   worst shall come, thou wilt set thyself to bear it as well as thou
				   canst. What will it signify to set thyself to bear, and to collect thy
				   strength to support thyself, when thou shalt fall into the hands of
				   that omnipotent King, Jehovah? He that made thee, can make his sword
				   approach unto thee. His sword is not the sword of man, nor is his wrath
				   the wrath of man. If it were, possibly stoutness might be maintained
				   under it. But it is the fierceness of the wrath of the great God, who
				   is able to baffle and dissipate all thy strength in a moment. He can
				   fill thy poor soul with an ocean of wrath, a deluge of fire and
				   brimstone; or he can make it ten thousand times fuller of torment than
				   ever an oven was full of fire; and at the same time, can fill it with
				   despair of ever seeing an end to its torment, or any rest from its
				   misery: and then where will be thy strength? What will become of thy
				   courage then? What will signify thine attempts to bear?
				
				   What art thou in the hands of the great God, who made heaven and earth
				   by speaking a word? What art thou, when dealt with by that strength,
				   which manages all this vast universe, holds the globe of the earth,
				   directs all the motions of the heavenly bodies from age to age, and,
				   when the fixed time shall come, will shake all to pieces? There are
				   other wicked beings a thousand times stronger than thou: there are the
				   great leviathans, strong and proud spirits, of a gigantic stoutness and
				   hardiness. But how little are they in the hands of the great God! They
				   are less than weak infants; they are nothing, and less than nothing in
				   the hands of an angry God, as will appear at the day of judgment. Their
				   hearts will be broken; they will sink; they will have no strength nor
				   courage left; they will be as weak as water; their souls will sink down
				   into an infinite gloom, an abyss of death and despair. Then what will
				   become of thee, a poor worm, when thou shalt fall into the hands of
				   that God, when he shall come to show his wrath, and make his power
				   known on thee?
				
				   If the strength of all the wicked men on earth, and of all the devils
				   in hell, were united in one, and thou wert possessed of it all; and if
				   the courage, greatness, and stoutness of all their hearts were united
				   in thy single heart, thou wouldst be nothing in the hands of Jehovah.
				   If it were all collected, and thou shouldst set thyself to bear as well
				   as thou couldst, all would sink under his great wrath in an instant,
				   and would be utterly abolished: thine hands would drop down at once and
				   thine heart would melt as wax.-The great mountains, the firm rocks,
				   cannot stand before the power of God; as fast as they stand, they are
				   tossed hither and thither, and skip like lambs, when God appears in his
				   anger. He can tear the earth in pieces iii a moment; yea, lie can
				   shatter the whole universe, and dash it to pieces at one blow. How then
				   will thine hands be strong, or thine heart endure?
				
				   Thou canst not stand before a lion of the forest; an angry wild beast,
				   if stirred up, will easily tear such a one as thou art in pieces. Yea,
				   not only so, but thou art crushed before the moth. A very little thing,
				   a little worm or spider, or some such insect, is able to kill thee.
				   What then canst thou do in the hands of God? It is vain to set the
				   briers and thorns in battle array against glowing flames; the points of
				   thorns, though sharp, do nothing to withstand the fire.
				
				   Some of you have seen buildings on fire; imagine therefore with
				   yourselves, what a poor hand you would make at fighting with the
				   flames, if you were in the midst of so great and fierce a fire. You
				   have often seen a spider, or some other noisome insect, when thrown
				   into the midst of a fierce fire, and have observed how immediately it
				   yields to the force of the flames. There is no long struggle, no
				   fighting against the fire, no strength exerted to oppose the heat, or
				   to fly from it; but it immediately stretches forth itself and yields;
				   and the fire takes possession of it, and at once it becomes full of
				   fire. Here is a little image of what you will be the subjects of in
				   hell, except you repent and fly to Christ. However you may think that
				   you will fortify yourselves, and bear as well as you can; the first
				   moment you shall be cast into hell, all your strength will sink and be
				   utterly abolished. To encourage yourselves, that you will set
				   yourselves to bear hell torments as well as you can, is just as if a
				   worm, that is about to be thrown into a glowing furnace, should swell
				   and fortify itself and prepare itself to fight the flames.
				
				   What can you do with lightnings? What doth it signify to fight with
				   them? What an absurd figure would a poor weak man make, who, in a
				   thunder-storm, should expect a flash of lightning on his head or his
				   breast, and should go forth sword in hand to oppose it; when a stream
				   of brimstone would, in an instant, drink up all his spirits and his
				   life, and melt his sword!
				   Consider these things, all you enemies of God, and rejecters of Christ,
				   whether you be old men or women, Christless heads of families, or young
				   people and wicked children. Be assured, that if you do not hearken and
				   repent, God intends to show his wrath, and make his power known upon
				   you. He intends to magnify himself exceedingly in sinking you down in
				   hell. He intends to show his great majesty at the day of judgment,
				   before a vast assembly, in your misery; before a greater assembly many
				   thousand fold than ever yet appeared on earth; before a vast assembly
				   of saints, and a vast assembly of wicked men, a vast assembly of holy
				   angels, and before all the crew of devils. God will before all these
				   get himself honor in your destruction; you shall be tormented in the
				   presence of them all. Then all will see that God is a great God indeed;
				   then all will see how dreadful a thing it is to sin against such a God,
				   and to reject such a Saviour, such love and grace, as you have rejected
				   and despised. All will be filled with awe at the great sight, and all
				   the saints and angels will look upon you, and adore that majesty, and
				   that mighty power, and that holiness and justice of God, which shall
				   appear in your ineffable destruction and misery.
				
				   It is probable that here are some, who hear me this day, who at this
				   very moment are unawakened, and are in a great degree careless about
				   their souls. I fear there are some among us who are most fearfully
				   hardened: their hearts are harder than the very rocks. It is easier to
				   make impressions upon an adamant than upon their hearts. I suppose some
				   of you have heard all that I have said with ease and quietness: it
				   appears to you as great big sounding words, but doth not reach your
				   hearts. You have heard such things many times: you are old soldiers,
				   and have been too much used to the roaring of heaven's cannon, to be
				   frighted at it. It will therefore probably be in vain for me to say any
				   thing further to you; I will only put you in mind that ere long God
				   will deal with you. I cannot deal with you, you despise what I say; I
				   have no power to make you sensible of your danger and misery, and of
				   the dreadfulness of the wrath of God. The attempts of men in this way
				   have often proved vain.
				
				   However, God hath undertaken to deal with such men as you are. It is
				   his manner commonly first to let men try their utmost strength:
				   particularly to let ministers try, that thus he may show ministers
				   their own weakness and impotency; and when they have done what they
				   can, and all fails, then God takes the matter into his own hands. So it
				   seems by your obstinacy, as if God intended to undertake to deal with
				   you. He will undertake to subdue you; he will see if he cannot cure you
				   of your senselessness and regardlessness of his threatenings. And you
				   will be convinced; you will be subdued effectually: your hearts will be
				   broken with a witness; your strength will be utterly broken, your
				   courage and hope will sink. God will surely break those who will not
				   bow. God, having girded himself with his power and wrath, hath
				   heretofore undertaken to deal with many hard stubborn, senseless,
				   obstinate hearts; and he never failed, he always did his work
				   thoroughly.
				   It will not be long before you will be wonderfully changed. You who now
				   hear of hell and the wrath of the great God, and sit here in these
				   seats so easy and quiet, and go away so careless; by and by will shake,
				   and tremble, and cry out, and shriek, and gnash your teeth, and will be
				   thoroughly convinced of the vast weight and importance of these great
				   things, which you now despise.

				Hypocrites Deficient in the Duty of Prayer
				
				    Job 27:10 -- Will he always call upon God?
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   Concerning these words, I would observe,
				
				   1. Who it is that is here spoken of, viz. the hypocrite; as you may
				   see, If you take the two preceding verses with the verse of the text.
				   "For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God
				   taketh away his soul? Will God bear his cry when trouble cometh upon
				   him? Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call up on
				   God?" Job's three friends, in their speeches to him, insisted much upon
				   it, that he was an hypocrite. But Job, in this chapter, asserts his
				   sincerity and integrity, and shows how different his own behavior had
				   been from that of hypocrite. Particularly he declares his steadfast and
				   immoveable resolution of persevering and holding out in the ways of
				   religion and righteousness to the end; as you may see in the six first
				   verses. In the text, he shows how contrary to this steadfastness and
				   perseverance the character of the hypocrite is, who is not wont thus to
				   hold out in religion
				
				   2. We may observe what duty of religion it is, with respect to which
				   the hypocrite is deciphered in the text, and that is the duty of
				   prayer; or calling upon God.
				
				   3. Here is something supposed of the hypocrite relating to this duty,
				   viz. That he may continue in it for a while; he may call upon God for a
				   season.
				
				   4. Something asserted, viz. That it is not the manner of hypocrites to
				   continue always in this duty. Will he always call upon God? It is in
				   the form of an interrogation; but the words have the force of a strong
				   negation, or of an assertion, that however the hypocrite may call upon
				   God for a season, yet he will not always continue in it.
				
				  DOCTRINE
				
				   However hypocrites may continue for a season in the duty of prayer, yet
				   it is their manner, after a while, in a great measure, to leave it off.
				   In speaking upon this doctrine, I shall show,
				
				   I. How hypocrites often continue for a season to call upon God.
				   II. How it is their manner, after a while, in a great measure to leave
				   off the practice of this duty.
				   III. Give some reasons why this is the manner of hypocrites.
				
				   I. I would show how hypocrites often continue for a season in the duty
				   of prayer.
				
				   1. They do so for a while after they have received common illuminations
				   and affections. While they are under awakenings, they may, through fear
				   of hell, call upon God, and attend very constantly upon the duty of
				   secret prayer. And after they have had some melting affections, having
				   their hearts much moved with the goodness of God, or with some
				   affecting encouragements, and false joy and comfort; while these
				   impressions last they continue to call upon God in the duty of secret
				   prayer.
				
				   2. After they have obtained an hope, and have made profession of their
				   good estate, they often continue for a while in the duty of secret
				   prayer. For a while they are affected with their hope: They think that
				   God hath delivered them out of a natural condition, and given them an
				   interest in Christ, thus introducing them into a state of safety from
				   that eternal misery which they lately feared. With this supposed
				   kindness of God to them, they are much affected, and often find in
				   themselves for a while a kind of love to God, excited by his supposed
				   love to them. Now, while this affection towards God continues, the
				   duties of religion seem pleasant to them; it is even with some delight
				   that they approach to God in their closets; and for the present it may
				   be, they think of no other than continuing to call upon God as long as
				   they live.
				
				   Yea, they may continue in the duty of secret prayer for awhile after
				   the liveliness of their affections is past, partly through the
				   influence of their former intentions: They intended to continue seeking
				   God always; and now suddenly to leave off, would therefore be too
				   shocking to their own minds and partly through the force of their own
				   preconceived notions, and what they have always believed, viz. That
				   godly persons do continue in religion, and that their goodness is not
				   like the morning cloud. Therefore, though they have no love to the duty
				   of prayer, and begin to grow weary of it, yet as they love their own
				   hope, they are somewhat backward to take a course, which will prove it
				   to be a false hope, and so deprive them of it.
				
				   If they should at once carry themselves so as they have always been
				   taught is a sign of a false hope, they would scare themselves Their
				   hope is dear to them, and it would scare them to see any plain evidence
				   that it is not true. Hence, for a considerable time after the force of
				   their illuminations and affections is over, and after they hate the
				   duty of prayer, and would be glad to have done with it, if they could,
				   without showing themselves to be hypocrites; they hold up a kind of
				   attendance upon the duty of secret prayer. This may keep up the outside
				   of religion in them for a good while, and occasion it to be somewhat
				   slowly that they are brought to neglect it. They must not leave off
				   suddenly, because that would be too great a shock to their false peace.
				   But they must come gradually to it, as they find their consciences can
				   bear it, and as they can find out devices and salvos to cover over the
				   matter, and make their so doing consistent, in their own opinion, with
				   the truth of their hope. But,
				
				   II. It is the manner of hypocrites, after a while, in a great measure
				   to leave off the practice of this duty. We are often taught, that the
				   seeming goodness and piety of hypocrites is not of a lasting and
				   persevering nature. It is so with respect to their practice of the duty
				   of prayer in particular, and especially of secret prayer. They can omit
				   this duty, and their omission of it not be taken notice of by others,
				   who know what profession they have made. So that a regard to their own
				   reputation doth not oblige them still to practice it. If others saw how
				   they neglect it, it would exceedingly shock their charity towards them.
				   But their neglect doth not fall under their observation; at least not
				   under the observation of many. Therefore they may omit this duty, and
				   still have the credit of being converted persons.
				
				   Men of this character can come to a neglect of secret prayer by degrees
				   without very much shocking their peace. For though indeed for a
				   converted person to live in a great measure without secret prayer, is
				   very wide of the notion they once had of a true convert; yet they find
				   means by degrees to alter their notions, and to bring their principles
				   to suit with their inclinations; and at length they come to that, in
				   their notions of things, that a man may be a convert, and yet live very
				   much in neglect of this duty. In time, they can bring all things to
				   suit well together, an hope of heaven, and an indulgence of sloth in
				   gratifying carnal appetites, and living in a great measure a prayerless
				   life. They cannot indeed suddenly make these things agree; it must be a
				   work of time; and length of time will effect it. By degrees they find
				   out ways to guard and defend their consciences against those powerful
				   enemies; so that those enemies, and a quiet, secure conscience, can at
				   length dwell pretty well together.
				
				   Whereas it is asserted in the doctrine, that it is the manner of
				   hypocrites, after a while, in a great measure to leave off this duty; I
				   would observe to you,
				
				   1. That it is not intended but that they may commonly continue to the
				   end of life in yielding an external attendance on open prayer, or
				   prayer with others. They may commonly be present at public prayers in
				   the congregation, and also at family prayer. This, in such places of
				   light as this is, men commonly do before ever they are so much as
				   awakened. Many vicious persons, who make no pretense to serious
				   religion, commonly attend public prayers in the congregation; and also
				   more private prayers, in the families in which they live, unless it be
				   when carnal designs interfere, or when their youthful pleasures and
				   diversions, and their vain company call them; and then they make no
				   conscience of attending family prayer. Otherwise they may continue to
				   attend upon prayer as long as they live, and yet may truly be said not
				   to call upon God. For such prayer, in the manner of it, is not their
				   own. They are present only for the sake of their credit, or in
				   compliance with others. They may be present at these prayers, and yet
				   have no proper prayer of their own. Many of those concerning whom it
				   maybe said, as in Job xv. 4, That they cast off fear and restrain
				   prayer before God, are yet frequently present at family and public
				   prayer.
				
				   2. But they in a great measure leave off the practice of secret prayer.
				   They come to this pass by degrees. At first they begin to be careless
				   about it, under some particular temptations. Because they have been out
				   in young company, or have been taken up very much with worldly
				   business, they omit it once: After that they more easily omit it again.
				   Thus it presently becomes a frequent thing with them to omit it and
				   after a while, it comes to that pass, that they seldom attend it.
				   Perhaps they attend it on Sabbath days, and sometimes on other days.
				   But they have ceased to make it a constant practice daily to retire to
				   worship God alone, and to seek his face in secret places. They
				   sometimes do a little to quiet conscience, and just to keep alive their
				   old hope; because it would be shocking to them, even after all their
				   subtle dealing with their consciences to call themselves converts, and
				   yet totally to live without prayer. Yet the practice of secret prayer
				   they have in a great measure left off.
				
				   I come now,
				
				   III. To the reasons why this is the manner of hypocrites.
				
				   1. Hypocrites never had the spirit of prayer given them. They may have
				   been stirred up to the external performance of this duty, and that with
				   a great deal of earnestness and affection, and yet always have been
				   destitute of the true spirit of prayer. The spirit of prayer is an holy
				   spirit, a gracious spirit. We read of the spirit of grace and
				   supplication, Zech. iii. 10. I will pour out on the house of David and
				   the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and supplications.
				   Wherever there is a true spirit of supplication, there is the spirit of
				   grace. The true spirit of prayer is no other than God's own Spirit
				   dwelling in the hearts of the saints. And as this spirit comes from
				   God, so doth it naturally tend to God in holy breathings and pantings.
				   It naturally leads to God, to converse with him by prayer. Therefore
				   the Spirit is said to make intercession for the saints with groanings
				   which cannot be uttered, Rom. viii. 26.
				
				   But it is far otherwise with the true convert. His work is not done;
				   but he finds still a great work to do, and great wants to be supplied.
				   He sees himself still to be a poor, empty, helpless creature, and that
				   he still stands in great and continual need of God's help. He is
				   sensible that without God he can do nothing. A false conversion makes a
				   man in his own eyes self-sufficient. He saith he is rich, and increased
				   with goods, and hath need of nothing; and knoweth not that be is
				   wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. But after a
				   true conversion, the soul remains sensible of its own impotence and
				   emptiness, as it is in itself, and its sense of it is rather increased
				   than diminished. It is still sensible of its universal dependence on
				   God for every thing. A true convert is sensible that his grace is very
				   imperfect; and he is very far from having all that he desires. Instead
				   of that, by conversion are begotten in him new desires which he never
				   had before. He now finds in him holy appetites, an hungering and
				   thirsting after righteousness, a longing after more acquaintance and
				   communion with God. So that he hath business enough still at the throne
				   of grace; yea, his business there, instead of being diminished, is,
				   since his conversion, rather increased.
				
				   3. The hope which the hypocrite hath of his good estate takes off the
				   force that the command of God before had upon his conscience; so that
				   now he dares neglect so plain a duty. The command which requires the
				   practice of the duty of prayer is exceeding plain; Matt. xxvi. 41.
				   "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation." Eph. vi. 18.
				   "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and
				   watching thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication for all
				   saints." Matt. vi. 6. "When thou prayest enter into thy closet, and
				   when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret."
				   As long as the hypocrite was in his own apprehension in continual
				   danger of hell, he durst not disobey these commands. But since he is,
				   as he thinks, safe from hell, he is grown bold, he dares to live in the
				   neglect of the plainest command in the Bible.
				
				   4. It is the manner of hypocrites, after a while, to return to sinful
				   practices, which will tend to keep them from praying. While they were
				   under convictions, they reformed their lives, and walked very exactly.
				   This reformation continues for a little time perhaps after their
				   supposed conversion, while they are much affected with hope and false
				   comfort. But as these things die away, their old lusts revive, and they
				   by degrees return like the dog to his vomit, and the sow that was
				   washed to her wallowing in the mire. They return to their sensual
				   practices, to their worldly practices, to their proud and contentious
				   practices, as before. And no wonder this makes them forsake their
				   closets. Sinning and praying agree not well together. If a man be
				   constant in the duty of secret prayer, it will tend to restrain him
				   from willful sinning. So, on the other hand, if he allow himself in
				   sinful practices, it will restrain him from praying. It will give quite
				   another turn to his mind, so that he will have no disposition to the
				   practice of such a duty It will be contrary to him. A man who knows
				   that he lives in sin against God, will not be inclined to come daily
				   into the presence of God; but will rather be inclined to fly from his
				   presence, as Adam, when he had eaten of the forbidden fruit, ran away
				   from God, and hid himself among the trees of the garden.
				
				   To keep up the duty of prayer after he hath given loose to his lusts,
				   would tend very much to disquiet a man's conscience. It would give
				   advantage to his conscience to testify aloud against him. If he should
				   come from his wickedness into the presence of God, immediately to speak
				   to him, his conscience would, as it were; fly in his face. Therefore
				   hypocrites, as they by degrees admit their wicked practices, exclude
				   prayer.
				
				   5. Hypocrites never counted the cost of perseverance in seeking God,
				   and of following him to the end of life. To continue instant in prayer
				   with all perseverance to the end of life, requires much care,
				   watchfulness, and labor. For much opposition is made to it by the
				   flesh, the world, and the devil and Christians meet with many
				   temptations to forsake this practice. He that would persevere in this
				   duty must be laborious in religion in general. But hypocrites never
				   count the cost of such labor; i. e. they never were prepared in the
				   disposition of their minds to give their lives to the service of God,
				   and to the duties of religion. It is therefore no great wonder if they
				   are weary and give out, after they have continued for a while, as their
				   affections are gone, and they find that prayer to them grows irksome
				   and tedious.
				
				   6. Hypocrites have no interest in those gracious promises which God
				   hath made to his people, of those spiritual supplies which are needful
				   in order to uphold them in the way of their duty to the end. God hath
				   promised to true saints that they shall not forsake him; Jer. xxxii.
				   40. I will put my fear into their hearts, that they shall not depart
				   from me. He hath promised that he will keep them in the way of their
				   duty; 1 Thess. v 23, 24. And the God of peace sanctify you wholly. And
				   I pray God your spirit, soul, and body, be preserved blameless unto the
				   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who
				   also will do it. But hypocrites have no interest in these and such like
				   promises and therefore are liable to fall away. If God do not uphold
				   men, there is no dependence on their steadfastness. If the Spirit of
				   God depart from them, they will soon become careless and profane, and
				   there will be an end to their seeming devotion and piety.
				
				  APPLICATION
				
				   May be in an use of exhortation in two branches.
				
				   I. I would exhort those who have entertained an hope of their being
				   true converts, and yet since their supposed conversion have left off
				   the duty of secret prayer, and do ordinarily allow themselves in the
				   omission of it, to throw away their hope. If you have left off calling
				   upon God, it is time for you to leave off hoping and flattering
				   yourselves with an imagination that you are the children of God.
				   Probably it will be a very difficult thing for you to do this. It is
				   hard for a man to let go an hope of heaven, on which he hath once
				   allowed himself to lay hold, and which he hath retained for a
				   considerable time. True conversion is a rare thing; but that men are
				   brought off from a false hope of conversion, after they are once
				   settled and established in it, and have continued in it for some time,
				   is much more rare.
				
				   Those things in men, which, if they were known to others, would be
				   sufficient to convince others that they are hypocrites, will not
				   convince themselves; and those things which would be sufficient to
				   convince them concerning others, and to cause them to cast others
				   entirely out of their charity, will not be sufficient to convince them
				   concerning themselves. They can make larger allowances for themselves
				   than they can for others. They can find out ways to solve objections
				   against their own hope, when they can find none in the like case for
				   their neighbor.
				
				   But if your case be such as is spoken of in the doctrine, it is surely
				   time for you to seek a better hope, and another work of God's Spirit,
				   than ever you have yet experienced; something more thorough and
				   effectual. When you see and find by experience, that the seed which was
				   sown in your hearts, though at first it sprang up and seemed
				   flourishing, yet is withering away, as by the heat of the sun, or is
				   choked, as with thorns; this shows in what sort of ground the seed was
				   sown, that it is either stony or thorny ground; and that therefore it
				   is necessary you should pass through another change, whereby your heart
				   may become good ground, which shall bring forth fruit with patience.
				
				   I insist not on that as a reason why you should not throw away your
				   hope, that you had the judgment of others, that the change of which you
				   were the subject was right. It is a small matter to be judged of man's
				   judgment, whether you be approved or condemned, and whether it be by
				   minister or people, wise or unwise. I Cor. iv. 3. " It is a very small
				   thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment." If your
				   goodness have proved to be as the morning cloud and early dew if you be
				   one of those who have forsaken God, and left off calling upon his name,
				   you have the judgment of God, and the sentence of God in the Scriptures
				   against you, which is a thousand times more than to have the judgment
				   of all the wise and godly men and ministers in the world in your favor.
				
				   Others, from your account of things, may have been obliged to have
				   charity for you, and to think that, provided you were not mistaken, and
				   in your account did not misrepresent things, or express them by wrong
				   terms, you were really converted. But what a miserable foundation is
				   this, upon which to build an hope as to your eternal state!
				
				   Here I request your attention to a few things in particular, which I
				   have to say to you concerning your hope.
				
				   1. Why will you retain that hope which by evident experience you find
				   poisons you? Is it reasonable to think, that an holy hope, an hope that
				   is from heaven, would have such an influence? No surely; nothing of
				   such a malignant influence comes from that world of purity and glory.
				   No poison groweth in the paradise of God. The same hope which leads men
				   to sin in this world will lead to hell hereafter. Why therefore will
				   you retain such an hope, of which your own experience shows you the ill
				   tendency, in that it encourages you to lead a wicked life? For
				   certainly that life is a wicked life wherein you live in the neglect of
				   so well known a duty as that of secret prayer, and in the disobedience
				   of so plain a command of God, as that by which this duty is enjoined.
				   And is not a way of disobedience to God a way to hell?
				
				   If your own experience of the nature and tendency of your hope will not
				   convince you of the falseness of it, what will? Are you resolved to
				   retain your hope, let it prove ever so unsound and hurtful? Will you
				   hold it fast till you go to hell with it? Many men cling to a false
				   hope, and embrace it so closely, that they never let it go till the
				   flames of hell cause their arms to unclench and let go their hold.
				   Consider how you will answer it at the day of judgment when God shall
				   call you to an account for your folly in resting in such an hope. Will
				   it be a sufficient answer for you to say, that you had the charity of
				   others, and that they thought your conversion was right?
				
				   Certainly it is foolish for men to imagine, that God had no more
				   wisdom, or could contrive no other way of bestowing comfort and hope of
				   eternal life than one which should encourage men to forsake him.
				
				   2. How is your doing, as you do, consistent with loving God above all?
				   If you have not spirit to love God above your dearest earthly friends,
				   and your most pleasant earthly enjoyments; the scriptures are very
				   plain, and full in it, that you are not true Christians. But if you had
				   indeed such a spirit, would you thus grow weary of the practice of
				   drawing near to him, and become habitually so averse to it, as in a
				   great measure to cast off so plain a duty which is so much the life of
				   a child of God? It is the nature of love to be averse to absence, and
				   to love a near access to those whom we love. We love to be with them;
				   we delight to come often to them, and to have much conversation with
				   them. But when a person who hath heretofore been wont to converse
				   freely with another, by degrees forsakes him, grows strange, and
				   converses with him but little, and that although the other be
				   importunate with him for the continuance of their former intimacy; this
				   plainly shows the coldness of his heart towards him.
				
				   The neglect of the duty of prayer seems to be inconsistent with supreme
				   love to Go also upon another account, and that is, that it is against
				   the will of God so plainly revealed. True love to God seeks to please
				   God in every thing, and universally to conform to his will.
				
				   3 Your thus restraining prayer before God is not only inconsistent with
				   the love, but also with the fear of God it is an argument that you cast
				   off fear, as is manifest by that text, Job. xv. 4. "Yea, thou castest
				   off fear, and restrainest prayer before God." While you thus live in
				   the transgression of so plain a command of God, you evidently show,
				   that there is no fear of God before your eyes. Psal. xxxvi. 1. "The
				   transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no
				   fear of God before his eyes."
				
				   4. Consider how living in such a neglect is inconsistent with leading
				   an holy life. We are abundantly instructed in scripture, that true
				   Christians do lead an holy life; that without holiness no man shall see
				   the Lord, Heb. xii. 14; and that every one that hath this hope in him,
				   purifieth himself, even as Christ is pure, 1 John iii. 3. In Prov. xvi.
				   17, it is said, The highway of the upright is to depart from evil, i.e.
				   it is, as it were, the common beaten road in which all the godly
				   travel. To the like purpose is Isa. xxxv. 8. A highway shall be there,
				   and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness; the unclean
				   shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those, i. e. those redeemed
				   persons spoken of in the foregoing verses. It is spoken of in Rom.
				   viii. 1, as the character of all believers, that they walk not after
				   the flesh, but after the spirit.
				
				   But how is a life, in a great measure prayerless, consistent with an
				   holy life? To lead an holy life is to lead a life devoted to God; a
				   life of worshipping and serving God; a life consecrated to the service
				   of God. But how doth he lead such a life who doth not so much as
				   maintain the duty of prayer? How can such a man be said to walk by the
				   Spirit and to be a servant of the Most High God? An holy life is a life
				   of faith. The life that true Christians live in the world they live by
				   the faith of the Son of God. But who can believe that man lives by
				   faith who lives without prayer, which, is the natural expression of
				   faith? Prayer is as natural an expression of faith as breathing is of
				   life; and to say a man lives a life of faith, and yet lives a
				   prayerless life, is every whit as inconsistent and incredible, as to
				   say, that a man lives without breathing. A prayerless life is so far
				   from being an holy life, that it is a profane life. He that lives so,
				   lives like an heathen, who calleth not on God's name; he that lives a
				   prayerless life, lives without God in the world.
				
				   5. If you live in the neglect of secret prayer, you show your good will
				   to neglect all the worship of God. He that prays only when he prays
				   with others, would not pray at all, were it not that the eyes of others
				   are upon him. He that will not pray where none but God seeth him,
				   manifestly doth not pray at all out of respect to God, or regard to his
				   all-seeing eye, and therefore doth in effect cast off all prayer. And
				   he that casts off prayer, in effect casts off all the worship of God,
				   of which prayer is the principal duty. Now, what a miserable saint is
				   he who is no worshipper of God! He that casts off the worship of God,
				   in effect casts off God himself: He refuses to own him, or to be
				   conversant with him as his God. For the way in which men own God, and
				   are conversant with him as their God, is by worshipping him.
				
				   6. How can you expect to dwell with God for ever, if you so neglect and
				   forsake him here? This your practice shows, that you place not your
				   happiness in God, in nearness to him, and communion with him. He Who
				   refuses to come and visit, and converse with a friend, and who in a
				   great measure forsakes him, when he is abundantly invited and
				   importuned to come; plainly shows that he places not his happiness in,
				   the company and conversation of that friend. Now, if this be the case
				   with you respecting God, then how can you expect to have it for your
				   happiness to all eternity, to be with God, and to enjoy holy communion
				   with him?
				
				   Let those persons who hope they are converted, and yet have in a great
				   measure left off the duty of secret prayer, and whose manner it is
				   ordinarily to neglect it, for their own sake seriously consider these
				   things. For what will profit then to please themselves with that, while
				   they live, which will fail them at last, and leave them in fearful and
				   amazing disappointment?
				
				   It is probable, that some of you who have entertained a good, opinion
				   of your state, and have looked upon yourselves as converts; but have of
				   late in a great measure left off the duty of secret prayer; will this
				   evening attend secret prayer, and so continue to do for a little while;
				   after your hearing this sermon, to the end, that you may solve the
				   difficulty, and the objection which is made against the truth of your
				   hope. But this will not hold. As it hath been in former instances of
				   the like nature, so what you now hear will have such effect upon you
				   but a little while. When the business and cares of the world shall
				   again begin to crowd a little upon you, or next time you shall go out
				   into young company, it is probable you will again neglect this duty.
				   The next time a frolic shall be appointed, to which it is proposed to
				   you to go, it is highly probable you will neglect not only secret
				   prayer; but also family prayer. Or at least, after a while, you will
				   come to the same pass again, as before, in casting off fear and
				   restraining prayer before God.
				
				   It is not very likely that you will ever be constant and persevering in
				   this duty, until you shall have obtained a better principle in your
				   hearts. The streams which have no springs to feed them will dry up. The
				   drought and heat consume the snow waters. Although they run plentifully
				   in the spring, yet when the sun ascends higher with a burning heat they
				   are gone. The seed that is sown in stony places, though it seem to
				   flourish at present, yet as the sun shall rise with a burning heat,
				   will wither away. None will bring forth fruit with patience, but those
				   whose hearts are become good ground.
				
				   Without any heavenly seed remaining in them, men may whenever they fall
				   in among the godly, continue all their lives to talk like saints. They
				   may, for their credit's sake, tell of what they have experienced But
				   their deeds will not hold. They may continue to tell of their inward
				   experiences, and yet live in the neglect of secret prayer, and of other
				   duties.
				
				   II. I would take occasion from this doctrine to exhort all to persevere
				   in the duty of prayer. This exhortation is much insisted on in the word
				   of God. It is insisted on in the Old Testament; I Chron. xvi. II. "Seek
				   the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually."...Isai. lxii. 7.
				   "Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence;" i. e. be not
				   silent as to the voice of prayer, as is manifest by the following
				   words, "and give him no rest till he establish and till he make
				   Jerusalem a praise in the earth," Israel of old is reproved for growing
				   weary of the duty of prayer. Isai. xliii. 22. "But thou hast not called
				   upon me, Jacob, thou hast been weary of me, Israel."
				
				   Perseverance in the duty of prayer is very much insisted on in the New
				   Testament; as Luke xviii. at the beginning, "A man ought always to
				   pray, and not to faint;" i. e. not to be discouraged or weary of the
				   duty; but should always continue in it. Again, Luke xxi. 36. "Watch ye
				   therefore, and pray always." We have the example of Anna the prophetess
				   set before us, Luke i. 36, &c. who, though she had lived to be more
				   than an hundred years old, yet never was weary of this duty. It is
				   said, "She departed not from the temple, but served God, with fastings
				   and prayers, night and day." Cornelius also is commended for his
				   constancy in this duty. It is said, that he prayed to God always; Acts
				   x. 2. The Apostle Paul, in his epistles, insists very much on constancy
				   in this duty; Rom. xii. 12. "Continuing instant in prayer." Eph. vi.
				   18,19. "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
				   and watching thereunto with all perseverance." Col. iv. 2. "Continue in
				   prayer, and watch in the same." I Thess. v. 17. "Pray without ceasing."
				   To the same effect the Apostle Peter, 1 Pet. iv. 7. "Watch unto
				   prayer."....Thus abundantly the scripture insists upon it, that we
				   should persevere in the duty of prayer; which shows that, it is of very
				   great importance that we should persevere. If the contrary be the
				   manner of hypocrites, as hath been shown in the doctrine, then surely
				   we ought to beware of this leaven.
				
				   But here let the following things be particularly considered as motives
				   to perseverance in this duty.
				
				   1. That perseverance in the way of duty is necessary to salvation, and
				   is abundantly declared so to be in the holy scriptures; as Isai. lxiv.
				   5. "Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those
				   that remember thee in thy ways: Behold, thou art wroth, for we have
				   sinned: In those is continuance, and we shall be saved." Heb. x. 38,
				   39. "Now the just shall live by faith: But if any man draw back, my
				   soul hath no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto
				   perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul." Rom.
				   xi. 22. "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: On them
				   which fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou continue in
				   his goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off....So in many other
				   places.
				
				   Many, when they think they are converted, seem to imagine that their
				   work is done, and that there is nothing else needful in order to their
				   going to heaven. Indeed perseverance in holiness of life is not
				   necessary to salvation, as the righteousness by which a right to
				   salvation is obtained. Nor is actual perseverance necessary in order to
				   our becoming interested in that righteousness by which we are
				   justified. For as soon as ever a soul hath believed in Christ, or hath
				   put forth one act of faith in him, it becomes interested in his
				   righteousness, and in all the promises purchased by it.
				
				   But persevering in the way of duty is necessary to salvation, as a
				   concomitant and evidence of a title to salvation. There is never a
				   title to salvation without it, though it be not the righteousness by
				   which a title to salvation is obtained. It is necessary to salvation,
				   as it is the necessary consequence of true faith. It is an evidence
				   which universally attends uprightness, and the defect of it is an
				   infallible evidence of the want of uprightness. Psal. cxxv. 4, 5. There
				   such as are good and upright in heart, are distinguished from such as
				   fall away or turn aside: "Do good, O Lord, to those that are good, and
				   to them that are upright in their hearts. As for such as turn aside to
				   their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of
				   iniquity. But peace shall be upon Israel." It is mentioned as an
				   evidence that the hearts of the children of Israel were not right with
				   God, that they did not persevere in the ways of holiness. Psal.
				   lxxviii. 8. "A generation that set not their hearts aright, and whose
				   spirit was not steadfast with God."
				
				   Christ gives this as a distinguishing character of those that are his
				   disciples indeed, and of a true and saving faith, that it is
				   accompanied with perseverance in the obedience of Christ's word. John
				   viii. 31. "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, if ye
				   continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed." This is
				   mentioned as a necessary evidence of an interest in Christ, Heb. iii.
				   14. "We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
				   confidence steadfast to the end."
				
				   Perseverance is not only a necessary concomitant and evidence of a
				   title to salvation; but also a necessary prerequisite to the actual
				   possession of eternal life. It is the only way to heaven, the narrow
				   way that leadeth to life. Hence Christ exhorts the church of
				   Philadelphia to persevere in holiness from this consideration, that it
				   was necessary in order to her obtaining the crown. Rev. iii. 11. "Hold
				   fast that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown." It is
				   necessary, not only that persons should once have been walking in the
				   way of duty, but that they should be found so doing when Christ cometh.
				   Luke ix. 43. "Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh,
				   shall find so doing." Holding out to the end is often made the
				   condition of actual salvation. Mat. x. 22. "He that endureth to the
				   end, the same shall be saved:" And Rev. ii. 10. "Be thou faithful unto
				   death, and I will give thee a crown of life."
				
				   2. In order to your own perseverance in the way of duty, your own care
				   and watchfulness is necessary. For though it be promised that true
				   saints shall persevere, yet that is no argument that their care and
				   watchfulness is not necessary in order to it; because their care to
				   keep the commands of God is the thing promised. If the saints should
				   fail of care, watchfulness, and diligence to persevere in holiness,
				   that failure of their care and diligence would itself be a failure of
				   holiness. They who persevere not in watchfulness and diligence,
				   persevere not in holiness of life, for holiness of life very much
				   consists in watchfulness and diligence to keep the commands of God. It
				   is one promise of the covenant of grace, that the Saints shall keep
				   God's commandments. Ezek. xi. 19, 20. Yet that is no argument that they
				   have no need to take care to keep these commandments, or to do their
				   duty. So the promise of God, that the saints shall persevere in
				   holiness, is no argument that it is not necessary that they should take
				   heed lest they fall away.
				
				   Therefore the scriptures abundantly warn men to watch over themselves
				   diligently, and to give earnest heed lest they fall away. 1 Cor. xv.
				   13. "Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."
				   1 Cor. x. 12. "Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he
				   fall." Heb. iii. 12, 13, 14. "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any
				   of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; but
				   exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be
				   hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of
				   Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the
				   end." Heb. iv. 1. "Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us
				   of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
				   2 Peter iii. 17. "Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things
				   before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
				   wicked, fall from your own steadfastness." 2 John v. 8. "Look to
				   yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but
				   that we receive a full reward."
				
				   Thus you see how earnestly the scriptures press on Christians
				   exhortations to take diligent heed to themselves that they fall not
				   away. And certainly these cautions are not without reason.
				
				   The scriptures particularly insist upon watchfulness in order to
				   perseverance in the duty of prayer. Watch and pray, saith Christ; which
				   implies that we should watch unto prayer, as the Apostle Peter says, 1
				   Pet. iv. 7. It implies, that we should watch against a neglect of
				   prayer, as well as against other sins. The apostle, in places which
				   have been already mentioned, directs us to pray with all prayer,
				   watching there unto with all perseverance, and to continue in prayer,
				   and watch in the same. Nor is it any wonder that the apostles so much
				   insisted on watching, in order to a continuance in prayer with all
				   perseverance; for there are many temptations to neglect this duty;
				   first to be inconstant in it, and from time to time to omit it; then in
				   a great measure to neglect it. The devil watches to draw us away from
				   God, and to hinder us from going to him in prayer. We are surrounded
				   with one and another tempting object, business, and diversion:
				   Particularly we meet with many things which are great temptations to a
				   neglect of this duty.
				
				   3. To move you to persevere in the duty of prayer, consider how much
				   you always stand in need of the help of God. If persons who have
				   formerly attended this duty, leave it off, the language of it is, that
				   now they stand in no further need of God's help, that they have no
				   further occasion to go to God with requests and supplications: When
				   indeed it is in God we live, and move, and have our being. We cannot
				   draw a breath without his help. You need his help every day, for the
				   supply of your outward wants; and especially you stand in continual
				   need of him to help your souls. Without his protection they would
				   immediately fall into the hands of the devil, who always stands as a
				   roaring lion, ready, whenever he is permitted, to fall upon the souls
				   of men and devour them. If God should indeed preserve your lives, but
				   should otherwise forsake and leave you to yourselves, you would be most
				   miserable: Your lives would be a curse to you.
				
				   Those that are converted, if God should forsake them, would soon fall
				   away totally from a state of grace into a state more miserable than
				   ever they were in before their conversion. They have no strength of
				   their own to resist those powerful enemies who surround them. Sin and
				   Satan would immediately carry them away, as a mighty flood, if God
				   should forsake them. You stand in need of daily supplies from God.
				   Without God you can receive no spiritual light nor comfort, can
				   exercise no grace, can bring forth no fruit. Without God your souls
				   will wither and pine away, and sink into a most wretched state. You
				   continually need the instructions and directions of God. What can a
				   little child do, in a vast howling wilderness, without some one to
				   guide it, and to lead it in the right way? Without God you will soon
				   fall into snares, and pits, and many fatal calamities.
				   Seeing therefore you stand in such continual need of the help of God,
				   how reasonable is it that you should continually seek it of him, and
				   perseveringly acknowledge your dependence upon him, by resorting to
				   him, to spread your needs before him, and to offer up your requests to
				   him in prayer. Let us consider how miserable we should be, if we should
				   leave off prayer, and God at the same time should leave off to take any
				   care of us, or to afford us any more supplies of his grace. By our
				   constancy in prayer, we cannot be profitable to God; and if we leave it
				   off, God will sustain no damage: He doth not need our prayers; Job x.
				   6, 7. But if God cease to care for us and to help us, we immediately
				   sink: We can do nothing: We can receive nothing without him.
				
				   4. Consider the great benefit of a constant, diligent, and persevering
				   attendance on this duty. It is one of the greatest and most excellent
				   means of nourishing the new nature, and of causing the soul to flourish
				   and prosper. It is an excellent mean of keeping up an acquaintance with
				   God, and of growing in the knowledge of God. It is the way to a life of
				   communion with God. It is an excellent mean of taking off the heart
				   from the vanities of the world and of causing the mind to be conversant
				   in heaven. It is an excellent preservative from sin and the wiles of
				   the devil, and a powerful antidote against the poison of the old
				   serpent. It is a duty whereby strength is derived from God against the
				   lusts and corruptions of the heart, and the snares of the world.
				
				   It hath a great tendency to keep the soul in a wakeful frame, and to
				   lead us to a strict walk with God, and to a life that shall be fruitful
				   in such good works, as tend to adorn the doctrine of Christ, and to
				   cause our light so to shine before others, that they, seeing our good
				   works, shall glorify our Father who is in heaven And if the duty be
				   constantly and diligently attended, it will be a very pleasant duty.
				   Slack and slothful attendance upon it, and unsteadiness in it, are the
				   causes which make it so great a burden as it is to some persons. Their
				   slothfulness in it hath naturally the effect to beget a dislike of the
				   duty and a great indisposition to it. But if it be constantly and
				   diligently attended, it is one of the best means of leading not only a
				   Christian and amiable, but also a pleasant life; a life of much sweet
				   fellowship with Christ, and of the abundant enjoyment of the light of
				   his countenance.
				
				   Besides, the great power which prayer, when duly attended, hath with
				   God, is worthy of your notice. By it men become like Jacob, who, as a
				   prince, had power with God, and prevailed, when he wrestled with God
				   for the blessing. See the power of prayer represented in James v.
				   16,18. By these things you may be sensible how much you will lose, if
				   you shall be negligent of this great duty of calling upon God; and how
				   ill you will consult your own interest by such a neglect.
				   I conclude my discourse with two directions in order to constancy and
				   perseverance in this duty.
				
				   1. Watch against the beginnings of a neglect of this duty. Persons who
				   have for a time practiced this duty, and afterwards neglect it,
				   commonly leave it off by degrees. While their convictions and religious
				   affections last, they are very constant in their closets, and no
				   worldly business, or company, or diversion hinders them. But as their
				   convictions and affections begin to die away, they begin to find
				   excuses to neglect it sometimes. They are now so hurried; they have now
				   such and such things to attend to; or there are now such inconveniences
				   in the way, that they persuade themselves they may very excusably omit
				   it for this time. Afterwards it pretty frequently so happens, that they
				   have something to hinder, something which they call a just excuse.
				   After a while, a less thing becomes a sufficient excuse than was
				   allowed to be such at first. Thus the person by degrees contracts more
				   and more of an habit of neglecting prayer, and becomes more and more
				   indisposed to it. And even when he doth perform it, it is in such a
				   poor, dull, heartless, miserable manner, that he says to himself, he
				   might as well not do it at all, as do it so. Thus he makes his own
				   dullness and indisposition an excuse for wholly neglecting it, or at
				   least for living in a great measure in the neglect of it. After this
				   manner do Satan and men's own corruptions inveigle them to their ruin.
				
				   Therefore beware of the first beginnings of a neglect: Watch against
				   temptations to it: Take heed how you begin to allow of excuses. Be
				   watchful to keep up the duty in the height of it; let it not so much as
				   begin to sink. For when you give way, though it be but little, it is
				   like giving way to an enemy in the field of battle; the first beginning
				   of a retreat greatly encourages the enemy, and weakens the retreating
				   soldiers.
				
				   2. Let me direct you to forsake all such practices as you find by
				   experience do indispose you to the duty of secret prayer. Examine the
				   things in which you have allowed yourselves, and inquire whether they
				   have had this effect. You are able to look over your past behavior, and
				   may doubtless, on an impartial consideration, make a judgment of the
				   practices and courses in which you have allowed yourselves.
				
				   Particularly let young people examine their manner of company keeping,
				   and the round of diversions in which, with their companions, they have
				   allowed themselves. I only desire that you would ask at the mouth of
				   your own consciences what has been the effect of these things with
				   respect to your attendance on the duty of secret prayer. Have you not
				   found that such practices have tended to the neglect of this duty? Have
				   you not found that after them you have been more indisposed to it, and
				   less conscientious and careful to attend it? Yea have they not from,
				   time to time, actually been the means of your neglecting it?
				
				   If you cannot deny that this is really the case, then, if you seek the
				   good of your souls, forsake these practices. Whatever you may plead for
				   them, as that there is no hurt in them, or that there is a time for all
				   things, and the like; yet if you find this hurt in the consequence of
				   them, it is time for you to forsake them. And if you value heaven more
				   than a little worldly diversion; if you set an higher price on eternal
				   glory than on a dance or a song, you will forsake them.
				
				   If these things be lawful in themselves, yet if your experience show,
				   that they are attended with such a consequence as I have now mentioned,
				   that is enough. It is lawful in itself for you to enjoy your right hand
				   and your right eye: But if, by experience, you find they cause you to
				   offend, it is time for you to cut off the one, and pluck out the other,
				   as you would rather go to heaven without them than go to hell with
				   them, into that place of torment where the worm dieth not, and the fire
				   is not quenched.

				THE JUSTICE OF GOD IN THE DAMNATION OF SINNERS
				
				    Romans 3:19 -- That every mouth may be stopped.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   THE main subject of the doctrinal part of this epistle, is the free
				   grace of God in the salvation of men by Christ Jesus; especially as it
				   appears in the doctrine of justification by faith alone. And the more
				   clearly to evince this doctrine, and show the reason of it, the
				   apostle, in the first place, establishes that point, that no flesh
				   living can be justified by the deeds of the law. And to prove it, he is
				   very large and particular in showing, that all mankind, not only the
				   Gentiles, but Jews, are under sin, and so under the condemnation of the
				   law; which is what he insists upon from the beginning of the epistle to
				   this place. He first begins with the Gentiles; and in the first chapter
				   shows that they are under sin, by setting forth the exceeding
				   corruptions and horrid wickedness that overspread the Gentile world:
				   and then through the second chapter, and the former part of this third
				   chapter, to the text and following verse, he shows the same of the
				   Jews, that they also are in the same circumstances with the Gentiles in
				   this regard. They had a high thought of themselves, because they were
				   God's covenant people, and circumcised, and the children of Abraham.
				   They despised the Gentiles as polluted, condemned, and accursed; but
				   looked on themselves, on account of their external privileges, and
				   ceremonial and moral righteousness, as a pure and holy people, and the
				   children of God; as the apostle observes in the second chapter. It was
				   therefore strange doctrine to them, that they also were unclean and
				   guilty in God's sight, and under the condemnation and curse of the law.
				   The apostle does therefore, on account of their strong prejudices
				   against such doctrine, the more particularly insists upon it, and shows
				   that they are no better than the Gentiles; and as in the 9th verse of
				   this chapter, "What then? Are we better than they? No, in no wise; for
				   we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under
				   sin." And, to convince them of it, he then produces certain passages
				   out of their own law, or the Old Testament, (to whose authority they
				   pretend a great regard,) from the ninth verse to our text. And it may
				   be observed, that the apostle, first, cites certain passages to prove
				   that all mankind are corrupt, (verses 10-12.) "As it is written, there
				   is none righteous, no not one: There is none that understandeth, there
				   is none that seeketh after God: They are all gone out of the way, they
				   are together become unprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no not
				   one." Secondly, the passages he cites next, are to prove, that not only
				   all are corrupt, but each one wholly corrupt, as it were all over
				   unclean, from the crown of the head to the soles of his feet; and
				   therefore several particular parts of thebody are mentioned, the
				   throat, the tongue, the lips, the mouth, the feet, (verses 13-15.)
				   "Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used
				   deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips; whose mouth is full of
				   cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood." And,
				   Thirdly, he quotes other passages to show, that each one is not only
				   all over corrupt, but corrupt to a desperate degree, by affirming the
				   most pernicious tendency of their wickedness; "Destruction and misery
				   are in their ways." And then by denying all goodness or godliness in
				   them; "And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of
				   God before their eyes." And then, lest the Jews should think these
				   passages of their law do not concern them, and only the Gentiles are
				   intended in them, the apostle shows in the text, not only that they are
				   not exempt, but that they especially must be understood: "Now we know
				   that whatsoever things the law saith, it saith to them who are under
				   the law." By those that are under the law is meant the Jews; and the
				   Gentiles by those that are without law; as appears by the 12th verse of
				   the preceding chapter. There is a special reason to understand the law,
				   as speaking to and of them, to whom it was immediately given. And
				   therefore the Jews would be unreasonable in exempting themselves. And
				   if we examine the places of the Old Testament whence these passages are
				   taken, we shall see plainly that special respect is had to the
				   wickedness of the people of that nation, in every one of them. So that
				   the law shuts all up in universal and desperate wickedness, that every
				   mouth may be stopped; the mouths of the Jews, as well as of the
				   Gentiles, notwithstanding all those privileges by which they were
				   distinguished from the Gentiles.
				
				   The things that the law says, are sufficient to stop the mouths of all
				   mankind, in two respects.
				
				   1. To stop them from boasting of their righteousness, as the Jews were
				   wont to do; as the apostle observes in the 23rd verse of the preceding
				   chapter.- That the apostle has respect to stopping their mouths in this
				   respect, appears by the 27th verse of the context, "Where is boasting
				   then? It is excluded." The law stops our mouths from making any plea
				   for life, or the favor of God, or any positive good, from our own
				   righteousness.
				
				   2. To stop them from making any excuse for ourselves, or objection
				   against the execution of the sentence of the law, or the infliction of
				   the punishment that it threatens. That it is intended, appears by the
				   words immediately following, "That all the world may become guilty
				   before God." That is, that they may appear to be guilty, and stand
				   convicted before God, and justly liable to the condemnation of his law,
				   as guilty of death, according to the Jewish way of speaking.
				
				   And thus the apostle proves, that no flesh can be justified in God's
				   sight by the deeds of the law; as he draws the conclusion in the
				   following verse; and so prepares the way for establishing of the great
				   doctrine of justification by faith alone, which he proceeds to do in
				   the following part of the chapter, and of the epistle.
				
				  DOCTRINE
				
				   "It is just with God eternally to cast off and destroy sinners."- For
				   this is the punishment which the law condemns to- The truth of this
				   doctrine may appear by the joint consideration of two things, viz.
				   Man's sinfulness, and God's sovereignty.
				
				   I. It appears from the consideration of man's sinfulness. And that
				   whether we consider the infinitely evil nature of all sin, or how much
				   sin men are guilty of.
				
				   1. If we consider the infinite evil and heinousness of sin in general,
				   it is not unjust in God to inflict what punishment is deserved; because
				   the very notion of deserving any punishment is, that it may be justly
				   inflicted. A deserved punishment and a just punishment are the same
				   thing. To say that one deserves such a punishment, and yet to say that
				   he does not justly deserve it, is a contradiction; and if he justly
				   deserves it, then it may be justly inflicted.
				
				   Every crime or fault deserves a greater or less punishment, in
				   proportion as the crime itself is greater or less. If any fault
				   deserves punishment, then so much the greater the fault, so much the
				   greater is the punishment deserved. The faulty nature of any thing is
				   the formal ground and reason of its desert of punishment; and therefore
				   the more any thing hath of this nature, the more punishment it
				   deserves. And therefore the terribleness of the degree of punishment,
				   let it be never be so terrible, is no argument against the justice of
				   it, if the proportion does but hold between the heinousness of the
				   crime and the dreadfulness of the punishment; so that if there be any
				   such thing as a fault infinitely heinous, it will follow that it is
				   just to inflict a punishment for it that is infinitely dreadful.
				
				   A crime is more or less heinous, according as we are under greater or
				   less obligations to the contrary. This is self-evident; because it is
				   herein that the criminalness or faultiness of any thing consists, that
				   it is contrary to what we are obliged or bound to, or what ought to be
				   in us. So the faultiness of one being hating another, is in proportion
				   to his obligation to love him. The crime of one being despising and
				   casting contempt on another, is proportionably more or less heinous, as
				   he was under greater or less obligations to honour him. The fault of
				   disobeying another, is greater or less, as any one is under greater or
				   less obligations to obey him. And therefore if there be any being that
				   we are under infinite obligations to love, and honour, and obey, the
				   contrary towards him must be infinitely faulty.
				   Our obligation to love, honour, and obey any being, is in proportion to
				   his loveliness, honourableness, and authority; for that is the very
				   meaning of the words. When we say any one is very lovely, it is the
				   same as to say, that he is one very much to be loved. Or if we say such
				   a one is more honourable than another, the meaning of the words is,
				   that he is one that we are more obliged to honour. If we say any one
				   has great authority over us, it is the same as to say, that he has
				   great right to our subjection and obedience.
				
				   But God is a being infinitely lovely, because he hath infinite
				   excellency and beauty. To have infinite excellency and beauty, is the
				   same thing as to have infinite loveliness. He is a being of infinite
				   greatness, majesty, and glory; and therefore he is infinitely
				   honourable. He is infinitely exalted above the greatest potentates of
				   the earth, and highest angels in heaven; and therefore he is infinitely
				   more honourable than they. His authority over us is infinite; and the
				   ground of his right to our obedience is infinitely strong; for he is
				   infinitely worthy to be obeyed himself, and we have an absolute,
				   universal, and infinite dependence upon him.
				
				   So that sin against God, being a violation of infinite obligations,
				   must be a crime infinitely heinous, and so deserving of infinite
				   punishment.- Nothing is more agreeable to the common sense of mankind,
				   than that sins committed against any one, must be proportionably
				   heinous to the dignity of the being offended and abused; as it is also
				   agreeable to the word of God, I Samuel 2:25. "If one man sin against
				   another, the judge shall judge him;" (i.e. shall judge him, and inflict
				   a finite punishment, such as finite judges can inflict;) "but if a man
				   sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?" This was the
				   aggravation of sin that made Joseph afraid of it. Genesis 39:9. "How
				   shall I commit this great wickedness, and sin against God?" This was
				   the aggravation of David's sin, in comparison of which he esteemed all
				   others as nothing, because they were infinitely exceeded by it. Psalm
				   51:4. "Against thee, thee only have I sinned."-The eternity of the
				   punishment of ungodly men renders it infinite: and it renders it no
				   more than infinite; and therefore renders no more than proportionable
				   to the heinousness of what they are guilty of.
				
				   If there be any evil or faultiness in sin against God, there is
				   certainly infinite evil: for if it be any fault at all, it has an
				   infinite aggravation, viz. that it is against an infinite object. If it
				   be ever so small upon other accounts, yet if it be any thing, it has
				   one infinite dimension; and so is an infinite evil. Which may be
				   illustrated by this: if we suppose a thing to have infinite length, but
				   no breadth and thickness, (a mere mathematical line,) it is nothing:
				   but if it have any breadth and thickness, though never so small, and
				   infinite length, the quantity of it is infinite; it exceeds the
				   quantity of any thing, however broad, thick, and long, wherein these
				   dimensions are all finite.
				
				   So that the objections made against the infinite punishment of sin,
				   from the necessity, or rather previous certainty, of the futurition of
				   sin, arising from the unavoidable original corruption of nature, if
				   they argue any thing, argue against any faultiness at all: for if this
				   necessity or certainty leaves any evil at all in sin, that fault must
				   be infinite by reason of the infinite object.
				
				   But every such objector as would argue from hence, that there is no
				   fault at all in sin, confutes himself, and shows his own insincerity in
				   his objection. For at the same time that he objects, that men's acts
				   are necessary, and that this kind of necessity is inconsistent with
				   faultiness in the act, his own practice shows that he does not believe
				   what he objects to be true: otherwise why does he at all blame men? Or
				   why are such persons at all displeased with men, for abusive,
				   injurious, and ungrateful acts towards them? Whatever they pretend, by
				   this they show that indeed they do believe that there is no necessity
				   in men's acts that is inconsistent with blame. And if their objection
				   be this, that this previous certainty is by God's own ordering, and
				   that where God orders an antecedent certainty of acts, he transfers all
				   the fault from the actor on himself; their practice shows, that at the
				   same time they do not believe this, but fully believe the contrary: for
				   when they are abused by men, they are displeased with men, and not with
				   God only.
				
				   The light of nature teaches all mankind, that when an injury is
				   voluntary, it is faulty, without any consideration of what there might
				   be previously to determine the futurition of that evil act of the will.
				   And it really teaches this as much to those that object and cavil most
				   as to others; as their universal practice shows. By which it appears,
				   that such objections are insincere and perverse. Men will mention
				   others' corrupt nature when they are injured, as a thing that
				   aggravates their crime, and that wherein their faultiness partly
				   consists. How common is it for persons, when they look on themselves
				   greatly injured by another, to inveigh against him, and aggravate his
				   baseness, by saying, "He is a man of a most perverse spirit: he is
				   naturally of a selfish, niggardly, or proud and haughty temper: he is
				   one of a base and vile disposition." And yet men's natural and corrupt
				   dispositions are mentioned as an excuse for them, with respect to their
				   sins against God, as if they rendered them blameless.
				
				   2. That it is just with God eternally to cast off wicked men, may more
				   abundantly appear, if we consider how much sin they are guilty of. From
				   what has been already said, it appears, that if men were guilty of sin
				   but in one particular, that is sufficient ground of their eternal
				   rejection and condemnation. If they are sinners, that is enough. Merely
				   this, might be sufficient to keep them from ever lifting up their
				   heads, and cause them to smite on their breasts, with the publican that
				   cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner." But sinful men are full of
				   sin; full of principles and acts of sin: their guilt is like great
				   mountains, heaped one upon another, till the pile is grown up to
				   heaven. They are totally corrupt, in every part, in all their
				   faculties, and all the principles of their nature, their
				   understandings, and wills; and in all their dispositions and
				   affections. Their heads, their hearts, are totally depraved; all the
				   members of their bodies are only instruments of sin; and all their
				   senses, seeing, hearing, tasting, &c. are only inlets and outlets of
				   sin, channels of corruption. There is nothing but sin, no good at all.
				   Romans. 7:18. "In me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing."
				   There is all manner of wickedness. There are the seeds of the greatest
				   and blackest crimes. There are principles of all sorts of wickedness
				   against men; and there is all wickedness against God. There is pride;
				   there is enmity; there is contempt; there is quarreling; there is
				   atheism; there is blasphemy. There are these things in exceeding
				   strength; the heart is under the power of them, is sold under sin, and
				   is a perfect slave to it. There is hard-heartedness, hardness greater
				   than that of a rock, or an adamant-stone. There is obstinacy and
				   perverseness, incorrigibleness and inflexibleness in sin, that will not
				   be overcome by threatenings or promises, by awakenings or
				   encouragements, by judgments or mercies, neither by that which is
				   terrifying nor that which is winning. The very blood of God our Saviour
				   will not win the heart of a wicked man.
				
				   And there are actual wickednesses without number or measure. There are
				   breaches of every command, in thought, word, and deed: a life full of
				   sin; days and nights filled up with sin; mercies abused and frowns
				   despised; mercy and justice, and all the divine perfections, trampled
				   on; and the honour of each person in the Trinity trod in the dirt. Now
				   if one sinful word or thought has so much evil in it, as to deserve
				   eternal destruction, how do they deserve to be eternally cast off and
				   destroyed, that are guilty of so much sin!
				
				   II. If with man's sinfulness, we consider God's sovereignty, it may
				   serve further to clear God's justice in the eternal rejection and
				   condemnation of sinners, from men's cavils and objections. I shall not
				   now pretend to determine precisely, what things are, and what things
				   are not, proper acts and exercises of God's holy sovereignty; but only,
				   that God's sovereignty extends to the following things.
				
				   1. That such is God's sovereign power and right, that he is originally
				   under no obligation to keep men from sinning; but may in his providence
				   permit and leave them to sin. He was not obliged to keep either angels
				   or men from falling. It is unreasonable to suppose, that God should be
				   obliged, if he makes a reasonable creature capable of knowing his will,
				   and receiving a law from him, and being subject to his moral
				   government, at the same time to make it impossible for him to sin, or
				   break his law. For if God be obliged to this, it destroys all use of
				   any commands, laws, promises, or threatenings, and the very notion of
				   any moral government of God over those reasonable creatures. For to
				   what purpose would it be, for God to give such and such laws, and
				   declare his holy will to a creature, and annex promises and
				   threatenings to move him to his duty, and make him careful to perform
				   it, if the creature at the same time has this to think of, that God is
				   obliged to make it impossible for him to break his laws? How can God's
				   threatenings move to care or watchfulness, when, at the same time, God
				   is obliged to render it impossible that he should be exposed to the
				   threatenings? Or, to what purpose is it for God to give a law at all?
				   For according to this supposition, it is God, and not the creature,
				   that is under the law. It is the lawgiver's care, and not the
				   subject's, to see that his law is obeyed; and this care is what the
				   lawgiver is absolutely obliged to! If God be obliged never to permit a
				   creature to fall, there is an end of all divine laws, or government, or
				   authority of God over the creature; there can be no manner of use of
				   these things.
				
				   God may permit sin, though the being of sin will certainly ensue on
				   that permission: and so, by permission, he may dispose and order the
				   event. If there were any such thing as chance, or mere contingence, and
				   the very notion of it did not carry a gross absurdity, (as might easily
				   be shown that it does,) it would have been very unfit that God should
				   have left it to mere chance, whether man should fall or no. For chance,
				   if there should be any such thing, is undesigning and blind. And
				   certainly it is more fit that an event of so great importance, and that
				   is attended with such an infinite train of great consequences, should
				   be disposed and ordered by infinite wisdom, than that it should be left
				   to blind chance.
				
				   If it be said, that God need not have interposed to render it
				   impossible for man to sin, and yet not leave it to mere contingence or
				   blind chance neither; but might have left it with man's free will, to
				   determine whether to sin or no: I answer, if God did leave it to man's
				   free will, without any sort of disposal, or ordering [or rather,
				   adequate cause] in the case, whence it should be previously certain how
				   that free will should determine, then still that first determination of
				   the will must be merely contingent or by chance. It could not have any
				   antecedent act of the will to determine it; for I speak now of the very
				   first act of motion of the will, respecting the affair that may be
				   looked upon as the prime ground and highest source of the event. To
				   suppose this to be determined by a foregoing act is a contradiction.
				   God's disposing this determination of the will by his permission, does
				   not at all infringe the liberty of the creature: it is in no respect
				   any more inconsistent with liberty, than mere chance or contingence.
				   For if the determination of the will be from blind, undesigning chance,
				   it is no more from the agent himself, or from the will itself, than if
				   we suppose, in the case, a wise, divine disposal by permission.
				
				   2. It was fit that it should be at the ordering of the divine wisdom
				   and good pleasure, whether every particular man should stand for
				   himself, or whether the first father of mankind should be appointed as
				   the moral and federal head and representative of the rest. If God has
				   not liberty in this matter to determine either of these two as he
				   pleases, it must be because determining that the first father of men
				   should represent the rest, and not that every one should stand for
				   himself, is injurious to mankind. For if it be not injurious, how is it
				   unjust? But it is not injurious to mankind; for there is nothing in the
				   nature of the case itself, that makes it better that each man should
				   stand for himself, than that all should be represented by their common
				   father; as the least reflection or consideration will convince any one.
				   And if there be nothing in the nature of the thing that makes the
				   former better for mankind than the latter, then it will follow, that
				   they are not hurt in God's choosing and appointing the latter, rather
				   than the former; or, which is the same thing, that it is not injurious
				   to mankind.
				
				   3. When men are fallen, and become sinful, God by his sovereignty has a
				   right to determine about their redemption as he pleases. He has a right
				   to determine whether he will redeem any or not. He might, if he had
				   pleased, have left all to perish, or might have redeemed all. Or, he
				   may redeem some, and leave others; and if he doth so, he may take whom
				   he pleases, and leave whom he pleases. To suppose that all have
				   forfeited his favor, and deserved to perish, and to suppose that he may
				   not leave any one individual of them to perish, implies a
				   contradiction; because it supposes that such a one has a claim to God's
				   favor, and is not justly liable to perish; which is contrary to the
				   supposition.
				
				   It is meet that God should order all these things according to his own
				   pleasure. By reason of his greatness and glory, by which he is
				   infinitely above all, he is worthy to be sovereign, and that his
				   pleasure should in all things take place. He is worthy that he should
				   make himself his end, and that he should make nothing but his own
				   wisdom his rule in pursuing that end, without asking leave or counsel
				   of any, and without giving account of any of his matters. It is fit
				   that he who is absolutely perfect, and infinitely wise, and the
				   Fountain of all wisdom, should determine every thing [that he effects]
				   by his own will, even things of the greatest importance. It is meet
				   that he should be thus sovereign, because he is the first being, the
				   eternal being, whence all other beings are. He is the Creator of all
				   things; and all are absolutely and universally dependent on him; and
				   therefore it is meet that he should act as the sovereign possessor of
				   heaven and earth.
				
				  APPLICATION
				
				   In the improvement of this doctrine, I would chiefly direct myself to
				   sinners who are afraid of damnation, in a use of conviction. This may
				   be matter of conviction to you, that it would be just and righteous
				   with God eternally to reject and destroy you. This is what you are in
				   danger of. You who are a Christless sinner are a poor condemned
				   creature: God's wrath still abides upon you; and the sentence of
				   condemnation lies upon you. You are in God's hands, and it is uncertain
				   what he will do with you. You are afraid what will become of you. You
				   are afraid that it will be your portion to suffer eternal burnings; and
				   your fears are not without grounds; you have reason to tremble every
				   moment. But be you never so much afraid of it, let eternal damnation be
				   never so dreadful, yet it is just. God may nevertheless do it, and be
				   righteous, and holy, and glorious. Though eternal damnation be what you
				   cannot bear, and how much soever your heart shrinks at the thought of
				   it, yet God's justice may be glorious in it. The dreadfulness of the
				   thing on your part, and the greatness of your dread of it, do not
				   render it the less righteous on God's part. If you think otherwise, it
				   is a sign that you do not see yourself, that you are not sensible what
				   sin is, nor how much of it you have been guilty of. Therefore for your
				   conviction, be directed,
				
				   First, To look over your past life: inquire at the mouth of conscience,
				   and hear what that has to testify concerning it. Consider what you are,
				   what light you have had, and what means you have lived under: and yet
				   how you have behaved yourself! What have those many days and nights you
				   have lived been filled up with? How have those years that have rolled
				   over your heads, one after another, been spent? What has the sun shone
				   upon you for, from day to day, while you have improved his light to
				   serve Satan by it? What has God kept your breath in your nostrils for,
				   and given you meat and drink, that you have spent your life and
				   strength, supported by them, in opposing God, and rebellion against
				   him?
				
				   How many sorts of wickedness have you not been guilty of! How manifold
				   have been the abominations of your life! What profaneness and contempt
				   of God has been exercised by you! How little regard have you had to the
				   Scriptures, to the word preached, to sabbaths, and sacraments! How
				   profanely have you talked, many of you, about those things that are
				   holy! After what manner have many of you kept God's holy day, not
				   regarding the holiness of the time, not caring what you thought of in
				   it! Yea, you have not only spent the time in worldly, vain, and
				   unprofitable thoughts, but in immoral thoughts; pleasing yourself with
				   the reflection on past acts of wickedness, and in contriving new acts.
				   Have not you spent much holy time in gratifying your lusts in your
				   imaginations; yea, not only holy time, but the very time of God's
				   public worship, when you have appeared in God's more immediate
				   presence? How have you not only attended to the worship, but have in
				   the mean time been feasting your lusts, and wallowing yourself in
				   abominable uncleanness! How many sabbaths have you spent, one after
				   another, in a most wretched manner! Some of you not only in worldly and
				   wicked thoughts, but also a very wicked outward behavior! When you on
				   sabbath-days have got along with your wicked companions, how has holy
				   time been treated among you! What kind of conversation has there been!
				   Yea, how have some of you, by a very indecent carriage, openly
				   dishonored and cast contempt on the sacred services of God's house, and
				   holy day! And what you have done some of you alone, what wicked
				   practices there have been in secret, even in holy time, God and your
				   own consciences know.
				
				   And how have you behaved yourself in the time of family prayer! And
				   what a trade have many of you made of absenting yourselves from the
				   worship of the families you belong to, for the sake of vain company!
				   And how have you continued in the neglect of secret prayer! Therein
				   wilfully living in a known sin, going abreast against as plain a
				   command as any in the Bible! Have you not been one that has cast off
				   fear, and restrained prayer before God?
				
				   What wicked carriage have some of you been guilty of towards your
				   parents! How far have you been from paying that honour to them which
				   God has required! Have you not even harboured ill-will and malice
				   towards them? And when they have displeased you, have wished evil to
				   them? yea, and shown your vile spirit in your behavior? and it is well
				   if you have not mocked them behind their backs; and, like the cursed
				   Ham and Canaan, as it were, derided your parents' nakedness instead of
				   covering it, and hiding your eyes from it. Have not some of you often
				   disobeyed your parents, yea, and refused to be subject to them? Is it
				   not a wonder of mercy and forbearance, that the proverb has not before
				   now been accomplished on you, Proverbs 30:17. "The eye that mocketh at
				   his father, and refuseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley
				   shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it."
				
				   What revenge and malice have you been guilty of towards your neighbors!
				   How have you indulged this spirit of the devil, hating others, and
				   wishing evil to them, rejoicing when evil befell them, and grieving at
				   others' prosperity, and lived in such a way for a long time! Have not
				   some of you allowed a passionate furious spirit, and behaved yourselves
				   in your anger more like wild beasts than like Christians?
				
				   What covetousness has been in many of you! Such has been your
				   inordinate love of the world, and care about the things of it, that it
				   has taken up your heart; you have allowed no room for God and religion;
				   you have minded the world more than your eternal salvation. For the
				   vanities of the world you have neglected reading, praying and
				   meditation; for the things of the world, you have broken the sabbath:
				   for the world you have spent a great deal of your time in quarreling.
				   For the world you have envied and hated your neighbor; for the world
				   you have cast God, and Christ, and heaven, behind your back; for the
				   world you have sold your own soul. You have as it were drowned your
				   soul in worldly cares and desires; you have been a mere earth-worm,
				   that is never in its element but when grovelling and buried in the
				   earth.
				
				   How much of a spirit of pride has appeared in you, which is in a
				   peculiar manner the spirit and condemnation of the devil! How have some
				   of you vaunted yourselves in your apparel! others in their riches!
				   others in their knowledge and abilities! How has it galled you to see
				   others above you! How much has it gone against the grain for you to
				   give others their due honour! And how have you shown your pride by
				   setting up your wills and in opposing others, and stirring up and
				   promoting division, and a party spirit in public affairs.
				
				   How sensual have you been! Are there not some here that have debased
				   themselves below the dignity of human nature, by wallowing in sensual
				   filthiness, as swine in the mire, or as filthy vermin feeding with
				   delight on rotten carrion? What intemperance have some of you been
				   guilty of! How much of your precious time have you spent at the tavern,
				   and in drinking companies, when you ought to have been at home seeking
				   God and your salvation in your families and closets!
				
				   And what abominable lasciviousness have some of you been guilty of! How
				   have you indulged yourself from day to day, and from night to night, in
				   all manner of unclean imaginations! Has not your soul been filled with
				   them, till it has become a hold of foul spirits, and a cage of every
				   unclean and hateful bird? What foul-mouthed persons have some of you
				   been, often in lewd and lascivious talk and unclean songs, wherein were
				   things not fit to be spoken! And such company, where such conversation
				   has been carried on, has been your delight. And with what unclean acts
				   and practices have you defiled yourself! God and your own consciences
				   know what abominable lasciviousness you have practised in things not
				   fit to be named, when you have been alone; when you ought to have been
				   reading, or meditating, or on your knees before God in secret prayer.
				   And how have you corrupted others, as well as polluted yourselves! What
				   vile uncleanness have you practised in company! What abominations have
				   you been guilty of in the dark! Such as the apostle doubtless had
				   respect to in Ephesians 5:12. "For it is a shame even to speak of those
				   things that are done of them in secret." Some of you have corrupted
				   others, and done what in you lay to undo their souls, (if you have not
				   actually done it;) and by your vile practices and example have made
				   room for Satan, invited his presence, and established his interest, in
				   the town where you have lived.
				   What lying have some of you been guilty of, especially in your
				   childhood! And have not your heart and lips often disagreed since you
				   came to riper years? What fraud, and deceit, and unfaithfulness, have
				   many of you practised in your own dealings with your neighbours, of
				   which your own heart is conscious, if you have not been noted by
				   others.
				
				   And how have some of you behaved yourselves in your family relations!
				   How have you neglected your children's souls! And not only so, but have
				   corrupted their minds by your bad examples; and instead of training
				   them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, have rather brought
				   them up in the devil's service!
				
				   How have some of you attended that sacred ordinance of the Lord's
				   supper without any manner of serious preparation, and in a careless
				   slighty frame of spirits, and chiefly to comply with custom! Have you
				   not ventured to put the sacred symbols of the body and blood of Christ
				   into your mouth, while at the same time you lived in ways of known
				   sins, and intended no other than still to go on in the same wicked
				   practices? And, it may be, have sat at the Lord's table with rancour in
				   your heart against some of your brethren that you have sat there with.
				   You have come even to that holy feast of love among God's children,
				   with the leaven of malice and envy in your heart; and so have eaten and
				   drank judgment to yourself.
				
				   What stupidity and sottishness has attended your course of wickedness:
				   which has appeared in your obstinacy under awakening dispensations of
				   God's word and providence. And how have some of you backslidden after
				   you have set out in religion, and quenched God's Spirit after he had
				   been striving with you! And what unsteadiness, and slothfulness, and
				   long misimprovement of God's strivings with you, have you been
				   chargeable with!
				
				   Now, can you think when you have thus behaved yourself, that God is
				   obliged to show you mercy? Are you not after all this ashamed to talk
				   of its being hard with God to cast you off? Does it become one who has
				   lived such a life to open his mouth to excuse himself, to object
				   against God's justice in his condemnation, or to complain of it as hard
				   in God not to give him converting and pardoning grace, and make him his
				   child, and bestow on him eternal life? Or to talk of his duties and
				   great pains in religion, as if such performances were worthy to be
				   accepted, and to draw God's heart to such a creature? If this has been
				   your manner, does it not show how little you have considered yourself,
				   and how little a sense you have had of your own sinfulness?
				
				   Secondly, Be directed to consider, if God should eternally reject and
				   destroy you, what an agreeableness and exact mutual answerableness
				   there would be between God so dealing with you, and your spirit and
				   behaviour. There would not only be an equality, but a similitude. God
				   declares, that his dealings with men shall be suitable to their
				   disposition and practice. Psalm 18:25, 26. "With the merciful man, thou
				   wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man, thou wilt show thyself
				   upright; with the pure, thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the
				   froward, thou wilt show thyself froward." How much soever you dread
				   damnation, and are affrighted and concerned at the thoughts of it; yet
				   if God should indeed eternally damn you, you would be met with but in
				   your own way; you would be dealt with exactly according to your own
				   dealing. Surely it is but fair that you should be made to buy in the
				   same measure in which you sell.
				
				   Here I would particularly show,- 1. That if God should eternally
				   destroy you, it would be agreeable to your treatment of God. 2. That it
				   would be agreeable to your treatment of Jesus Christ. 3. That it would
				   be agreeable to your behaviour towards your neighbours. 4. That it
				   would be according to your own foolish behaviour towards yourself.
				
				   I. If God should for ever cast you off, it would be exactly agreeable
				   to your treatment of him. That you may be sensible of this, consider,
				
				   1. You never have exercised the least degree of love to God; and
				   therefore it would be agreeable to your treatment of him, if he should
				   never express any love to you. When God converts and saves a sinner, it
				   is a wonderful and unspeakable manifestation of divine love. When a
				   poor lost soul is brought home to Christ, and has all his sins forgiven
				   him, and is made a child of God, it will take up a whole eternity to
				   express and declare the greatness of that love. And why should God be
				   obliged to express such wonderful love to you, who never exercised the
				   least degree of love to him in all your life? You never have loved God,
				   who is infinitely glorious and lovely; and why then is God under
				   obligation to love you, who are all over deformed and loathsome as a
				   filthy worm, or rather a hateful viper? You have no benevolence in your
				   heart towards God; you never rejoiced in God's happiness; if he had
				   been miserable, and that had been possible, you would have liked it as
				   well as if he were happy; you would not have cared how miserable he
				   was, nor mourned for it, any more than you now do for the devil's being
				   miserable. And why then should God be looked upon as obliged to take so
				   much care for your happiness, as to do such great things for it, as he
				   doth for those that are saved? Or why should God be called hard, in
				   case he should not be careful to save you from misery? You care not
				   what becomes of God's glory; you are not distressed how much soever his
				   honour seems to suffer in the world: and why should God care any more
				   for your welfare? Has it not been so, that if you could but promote
				   your private interest, and gratify your own lusts, you cared not how
				   much the glory of God suffered? And why may not God advance his own
				   glory in the ruin of your welfare, not caring how much your interest
				   suffers by it? You never so much as stirred one step, sincerely making
				   the glory of God your end, or acting from real respect to him: and why
				   then is it hard if God doth not do such great things for you, as the
				   changing of your nature, raising you from spiritual death to life,
				   conquering the powers of darkness for you, translating you out of the
				   kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son, delivering you
				   from eternal misery, and bestowing upon you eternal glory? You were not
				   willing to deny yourself for God; you never cared to put yourself out
				   of your way for Christ; whenever any thing cross or difficult came in
				   your way, that the glory of God was concerned in, it has been your
				   manner to shun it, and excuse yourself from it. You did not care to
				   hurt yourself for Christ, whom you did not see worthy of it; and why
				   then must it be looked upon as a hard and cruel thing, if Christ has
				   not been pleased to spill his blood and be tormented to death for such
				   a sinner.
				
				   2. You have slighted God; and why then may not God justly slight you?
				   When sinners are sensible in some measure of their misery, they are
				   ready to think it hard that God will take no notice of them; that he
				   will see them in such a lamentable distressed condition, beholding
				   their burdens and tears, and seem to slight it, and manifest no pity to
				   them. Their souls they think are precious: it would be a dreadful thing
				   if they should perish, and burn in hell for ever. They do not see
				   through it, that God should make so light of their salvation. But then,
				   ought they not to consider, that as their souls are precious, so is
				   God's honour precious? The honour of the infinite God, the great King
				   of heaven and earth, is a thing of as great importance, (and surely may
				   justly be so esteemed by God,) as the happiness of you, a poor little
				   worm. But yet you have slighted that honour of God, and valued it no
				   more than the dirt under your feet. You have been told that such and
				   such things were contrary to the will of a holy God, and against his
				   honour; but you cared not for that. God called upon you, and exhorted
				   you to be more tender of his honour; but you went on without regarding
				   him. Thus have you slighted God! And yet, is it hard that God should
				   slight you? Are you more honourable than God, that he must be obliged
				   to make much of you, how light soever you make of him and his glory?
				
				   And you have not only slighted God in time past, but you slight him
				   still. You indeed now make a pretence and show of honouring him in your
				   prayers, and attendance on other external duties, and by sober
				   countenance, and seeming devoutness in your words and behaviour; but it
				   if all mere dissembling. That downcast look and seeming reverence, is
				   not from any honour you have to God in your heart, though you would
				   have God take it so. You who have not believed in Christ, have not the
				   least jot of honour to God; that show of it is merely forced, and what
				   you are driven to by fear, like those mentioned in Psalm 66:3. "Through
				   the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves to
				   thee." In the original it is, "shall lie unto thee;" that is, yield
				   feigned submission, and dissemble respect and honour to thee. There is
				   a rod held over you that makes you seem to pay such respect to God.
				   This religion and devotion, even the very appearance of it, would soon
				   be gone, and all vanish away, if that were removed. Sometimes it may be
				   you weep in your prayers, and in your hearing sermons, and hope God
				   will take notice of it, and take it for some honour; but he sees it to
				   be all hypocrisy. You weep for yourself; you are afraid of hell; and do
				   you think that is worthy of God to take much notice of you, because you
				   can cry when you are in danger of being damned; when at the same time
				   you indeed care nothing for God's honour.
				
				   Seeing you thus disregard so great a God, is it a heinous thing for God
				   to slight you, a little, wretched, despicable creature; a worm, a mere
				   nothing, and less than nothing; a vile insect, that has risen up in
				   contempt against the Majesty of heaven and earth?
				
				   3. Why should God be looked upon as obliged to bestow salvation upon
				   you, when you have been so ungrateful for the mercies he has bestowed
				   upon you already? God has tried you with a great deal of kindness, and
				   he never has sincerely been thanked by you for any of it. God has
				   watched over you, and preserved you, and provided for you, and followed
				   you with mercy all your days; and yet you have continued sinning
				   against him. He has given you food and raiment, but you have improved
				   both in the service of sin. He has preserved you while you slept; but
				   when you arose, it was to return to the old trade of sinning. God,
				   notwithstanding this ingratitude, has still continued his mercy; but
				   his kindness has never won your heart, or brought you to a more
				   grateful behaviour towards him. It may be you have received many
				   remarkable mercies, recoveries from sickness, or preservations of your
				   life when exposed by accidents, when if you had died, you would have
				   gone directly to hell; but you never had any true thankfulness for any
				   of these mercies. God has kept you out of hell, and continued your day
				   of grace, and the offers of salvation, so long a time; while you did
				   not regard your own salvation so much as in secret to ask God for it.
				   And now God has greatly added to his mercy to you, by giving you the
				   strivings of his Spirit, whereby a most precious opportunity for your
				   salvation is in your hands. But what thanks has God received for it?
				   What kind of returns have you made for all this kindness? As God has
				   multiplied mercies, so have you multiplied provocations.
				
				   And yet now are you ready to quarrel for mercy, and to find fault with
				   God, not only that he does not bestow more mercy, but to contend with
				   him, because he does not bestow infinite mercy upon you, heaven with
				   all it contains, and even himself, for your eternal portion. What ideas
				   have you of yourself, that you think God is obliged to do so much for
				   you, though you treat him ever so ungratefully for his kindness
				   wherewith you have been followed all the days of your life.
				
				   4. You have voluntarily chosen to be with Satan in his enmity and
				   opposition to God; how justly therefore might you be with him in his
				   punishment! You did not choose to be on God's side, but rather chose to
				   side with the devil, and have obstinately continued in it, against
				   God's often repeated calls and counsels. You have chosen rather to
				   hearken to Satan than to God, and would be with him in his work. You
				   have given yourself up to him, to be subject to his power and
				   government, in opposition to God; how justly therefore may God also
				   give you up to him, and leave you in his power, to accomplish your
				   ruin! Seeing you have yielded yourself to his will, to do as he would
				   have you, surely God may leave you in his hands to execute his will
				   upon you. If men will be with God's enemy, and on his side, why is God
				   obliged to redeem them out of his hands, when they have done his work?
				   Doubtless you would be glad to serve the devil, and be God's enemy
				   while you live, and then to have God your friend, and deliver you from
				   the devil, when you come to die. But will God be unjust if he deals
				   otherwise by you? No, surely! It will be altogether and perfectly just,
				   that you should have your portion with him with whom you have chosen to
				   work; and that you should be in his possession to whose dominion you
				   have yielded yourself; and if you cry to God for deliverance, he may
				   most justly give you that answer. Judges 10:14. "Go to the gods which
				   you have chosen."
				
				   5. Consider how often you have refused to hear God's calls to you, and
				   how just it would therefore be, if he should refuse to hear you when
				   you call upon him. You are ready, it may be, to complain that you have
				   often prayed, and earnestly begged of God to show you mercy, and yet
				   have no answer of prayer: One says, I have been constant in prayer for
				   so many years, and God has not heard me. Another says, I have done what
				   I can; I have prayed as earnestly as I am able; I do not see how I can
				   do more; and it will seem hard if after all I am denied. But do you
				   consider how often God has called, and you have denied him? God has
				   called earnestly, and for a long time; he has called and called again
				   in his word, and in his providence, and you have refused. You was not
				   uneasy for fear you should not show regard enough to his calls. You let
				   him call as loud and as long as he would; for your part, you had no
				   leisure to attend to what he said; you had other business to mind; you
				   had these and those lusts to gratify and please, and worldly concerns
				   to attend; you could not afford to stand considering of what God had to
				   say to you. When the ministers of Christ have stood and pleaded with
				   you, in his name, sabbath after sabbath, and have even spent their
				   strength in it, how little was you moved! It did not alter you, but you
				   went on still as you used to do; when you went away, you returned again
				   to your sins, to your lasciviousness, to your vain mirth, to your
				   covetousness, to your intemperance, and that has been the language of
				   your heart and practice, Exodus 5:2. "Who is the Lord, that I should
				   obey his voice?" Was it no crime for you to refuse to hear when God
				   called? And yet is it now very hard that God does not hear your earnest
				   calls, and that though your calling on God be not from any respect to
				   him, but merely from self-love? The devil would beg as earnestly as
				   you, if he had any hope to get salvation by it, and a thousand times as
				   earnestly, and yet be as much of a devil as he is now. Are your calls
				   more worthy to be heard than God's? Or is God more obliged to regard
				   what you say to him, than you to regard his commands, counsels, and
				   invitations to you? What can be more justice than this, Proverbs 1:24,
				   &c. "Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my
				   hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel,
				   and would none of my reproof: I will also laugh at your calamity, I
				   will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation,
				   and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish
				   cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer;
				   they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me."
				
				   6. Have you not taken encouragement to sin against God, on that very
				   presumption, that God would show you mercy when you sought it? And may
				   not God justly refuse you that mercy that you have so presumed upon?
				   You have flattered yourself, that though you did so, yet God would show
				   you mercy when you cried earnestly to him for it: how righteous
				   therefore would it be in God, to disappoint such a wicked presumption!
				   It was upon that very hope that you dared to affront the majesty of
				   heaven so dreadfully as you have done; and can you now be so sottish as
				   to think that God is obliged not to frustrate that hope?
				
				   When a sinner takes encouragement to neglect secret prayer which God
				   has commanded, to gratify his lusts, to live a carnal vain life, to
				   thwart God, to run upon him, and contemn him to his face, thinking with
				   himself, "If I do so, God would not damn me; he is a merciful God, and
				   therefore when I seek his mercy he will bestow it upon me;" must God be
				   accounted hard because he will not do according to such a sinner's
				   presumption?
				
				   Cannot he be excused from showing such a sinner mercy when he is
				   pleased to seek it, without incurring the charge of being unjust; if
				   this be the case, God has no liberty to vindicate his own honour and
				   majesty; but must lay himself open to all manner of affronts, and yield
				   himself up to the abuse of vile men, though they disobey, despise, and
				   dishonour him, as much as they will; and when they have done, his mercy
				   and pardoning grace must not be in his own power and at his own
				   disposal, but he must be obliged to dispense it at their call. He must
				   take these bold and vile contemners of his majesty, when it suits them
				   to ask it, and must forgive all their sins, and not only so, but must
				   adopt them into his family, and make them his children, and bestow
				   eternal glory upon them. What mean, low, and strange thoughts have such
				   men of God, who think thus of him! Consider, that you have injured God
				   the more, and have been the worse enemy to him, for his being a
				   merciful God. So have you treated that attribute of God's mercy! How
				   just is it therefore that you never should have any benefit of that
				   attribute!
				
				   There is something peculiarly heinous in sinning against the mercy of
				   God more than other attributes. There is such base and horrid
				   ingratitude, in being the worse to God because he is a being of
				   infinite goodness and grace, that it above all things renders
				   wickedness vile and detestable. This ought to win us, and engage us to
				   serve God better; but instead of that, to sin against him the more, has
				   something inexpressibly bad in it, and does in a peculiar manner
				   enhance guilt, and incense wrath; as seems to be intimated, Romans 2:4,
				   5. "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and
				   long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
				   repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up
				   unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the
				   righteous judgment of God."
				
				   The greater the mercy of God is, the more should you be engaged to love
				   him, and live to his glory. But it has been contrariwise with you; the
				   consideration of the mercies of God being so exceeding great, is the
				   thing wherewith you have encouraged yourself in sin. You have heard
				   that the mercy of God was without bounds, that it was sufficient to
				   pardon the greatest sinner, and you have upon that very account
				   ventured to be a very great sinner. Though it was very offensive to
				   God, though you heard that God infinitely hated sin, and that such
				   practices as you went on in were exceeding contrary to his nature,
				   will, and glory, yet that did not make you uneasy; you heard that he
				   was a very merciful God, and had grace enough to pardon you, and so
				   cared not how offensive your sins were to him. How long have some of
				   you gone on in sin, and what great sins have some of you been guilty
				   of, on that presumption! Your own conscience can give testimony to it,
				   that this has made you refuse God's calls, and has made you regardless
				   of his repeated commands. Now, how righteous would it be if God should
				   swear in his wrath, that you should never be the better for his being
				   infinitely merciful!
				
				   Your ingratitude has been the greater, that you have not only abused
				   the attribute of God's mercy, taking encouragement from it to continue
				   in sin, but you have also presumed that God would exercise infinite
				   mercy to you in particular; which consideration should have especially
				   endeared God to you. You have taken encouragement to sin the more, from
				   that consideration, that Christ came into the would and died to save
				   sinners; such thanks has Christ had from you, for enduring such a
				   tormenting death for his enemies! Now, how justly might God refuse that
				   you should ever be the better for his Son's laying down his life! It
				   was because of these things that you put off seeking salvation. You
				   would take the pleasures of sin still longer, hardening yourself
				   because mercy was infinite, and it would not be too late, if you sought
				   it afterwards; now, how justly may God disappoint you in this, and so
				   order it that it shall be too late!
				
				   7. How have some of you risen up against God, and in the frame of your
				   minds opposed him in his sovereign dispensations! And how justly upon
				   that account might God oppose you, and set himself against you! You
				   never yet would submit to God; never willingly comply, that God should
				   have dominion over the world, and that he should govern it for his own
				   glory, according to his own wisdom. You, a poor worm, a potsherd, a
				   broken piece of an earthen vessel, have dared to find fault and quarrel
				   with God. Isaiah 45:9. "Woe to him that striveth with his Maker. Let
				   the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth: shall the clay say
				   to him that fashioned it, What makest thou?" But yet you have ventured
				   to do it. Romans 9:20. "Who art thou, O man, that repliest against
				   God?" But yet you have thought you was big enough; you have taken upon
				   you to call God to an account, why he does thus and thus; you have said
				   to Jehovah, What dost thou?
				
				   If you have been restrained by fear from openly venting your opposition
				   and enmity of heart against God's government, yet it has been in you;
				   you have not been quiet in the frame of your mind; you have had the
				   heart of a viper within, and have been ready to spit your venom at God.
				   It is well if sometimes you have not actually done it, by tolerating
				   blasphemous thoughts and malignant risings of heart against him; yea,
				   and the frame of your heart in some measure appeared in impatient and
				   fretful behaviour.- Now, seeing you have thus opposed God, how just is
				   it that God should oppose you! Or is it because you are so much better,
				   and so much greater than God, that it is a crime for him to make that
				   opposition against you which you make against him? Do you think that
				   the liberty of making opposition is your exclusive prerogative, so that
				   you may be an enemy to God, but God must by no means be an enemy to
				   you, but must be looked upon under obligation nevertheless to help you,
				   and save you by his blood, and bestow his best blessings upon you?
				
				   Consider how in the frame of your mind you have thwarted God in those
				   very exercises of mercy towards others that you are seeking for
				   yourself. God exercising his infinite grace towards your neighbours,
				   has put you into an ill frame, and it may be, set you into a tumult of
				   mind. How justly therefore may God refuse ever to exercise that mercy
				   towards you! Have you not thus opposed God showing mercy to others,
				   even at the very time when you pretended to be earnest with God for
				   pity and help for yourself? Yea, and while you was endeavouring to get
				   something wherewith to recommend yourself to God? And will you look to
				   God still with a challenge of mercy, and contend with him for it
				   notwithstanding? Can you who have such a heart, and have thus behaved
				   yourself, come to God for any other than mere sovereign mercy?
				
				   II. If you should for ever be cast off by God, it would be agreeable to
				   your treatment of Jesus Christ. It would have been just with God if he
				   had cast you off for ever, without ever making you the offer of a
				   Saviour. But God hath not done that; he has provided a Saviour for
				   sinners, and offered him to you, even his own Son Jesus Christ, who is
				   the only Saviour of men. All that are not for ever cast off are saved
				   by him. God offers men salvation through him, and has promised us, that
				   if we come to him, we shall not be cast off. But if you have treated,
				   and still treat, this Saviour after such a manner, that if you should
				   be eternally cast off by God, it would be most agreeable to your
				   behaviour towards him; which appears by this, viz. "That you reject
				   Christ, and will not have him for your Saviour."
				
				   If God offers you a Saviour from deserved punishment, and you will not
				   receive him, then surely it is just that you should go without a
				   Saviour. Or is God obliged, because you do not like this Saviour, to
				   provide you another? He has given an infinitely honourable and glorious
				   person, even his only begotten Son, to be a sacrifice for sin, and so
				   provided salvation; and this Saviour is offered to you: now if you
				   refuse to accept him, is God therefore unjust if he does not save you?
				   Is he obliged to save you in a way of your own choosing, because you do
				   not like the way of his choosing? Or will you charge Christ with
				   injustice because he does not become your Saviour, when at the same
				   time you will not have him when he offers himself to you, and beseeches
				   you to accept of him as your Saviour?
				
				   I am sensible that by this time many persons are ready to object
				   against this. If all should speak what they now think, we should hear a
				   murmuring all over the meeting-house, and one and another would say, "I
				   cannot see how this can be, that I am not willing that Christ should be
				   my Saviour, when I would give all the world that he was my Saviour: how
				   is it possible that I should not be willing to have Christ for my
				   Saviour when this is what I am seeking after, and praying for, and
				   striving for, as for my life?"
				
				   Here therefore I would endeavour to convince you, that you are under a
				   gross mistake in this matter. And, First, I would endeavour to show the
				   grounds of your mistake. And Secondly, To demonstrate to you, that you
				   have rejected, and do wilfully reject, Jesus Christ.
				
				   First, That you may see the weak grounds of your mistake, consider,
				
				   1. There is a great deal of difference between a willingness not to be
				   damned, and a being willing to receive Christ for your Savior. You have
				   the former; there is no doubt of that: nobody supposes that you love
				   misery so as to choose an eternity of it; and so doubtless you are
				   willing to be saved from eternal misery. But that is a very different
				   thing from being willing to come to Christ: persons very commonly
				   mistake the one for the other, but they are quite two things. You may
				   love the deliverance, but hate the deliverer. You tell of a
				   willingness; but consider what is the object of that willingness. It
				   does not respect Christ; the way of salvation by him is not at all the
				   object of it; but it is wholly terminated on your escape from misery.
				   The inclination of your will goes no further than self, it never
				   reaches Christ. You are willing not to be miserable; that is, you love
				   yourself, and there your will and choice terminate. And it is but a
				   vain pretence and delusion to say or think, that you are willing to
				   accept of Christ.
				
				   2. There is certainly a great deal of difference between a forced
				   compliance and a free willingness. Force and freedom cannot consist
				   together. Now that willingness, whereby you think you are willing to
				   have Christ for a Saviour, is merely a forced thing. Your heart does
				   not go out after Christ of itself, but you are forced and driven to
				   seek an interest in him. Christ has no share at all in your heart;
				   there is no manner of closing of the heart with him. This forced
				   compliance is not what Christ seeks of you; he seeks a free and willing
				   acceptance, Psalm 110:3. "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy
				   power." He seeks not that you should receive him against your will, but
				   with a free will. He seeks entertainment in your heart and choice.- And
				   if you refuse thus to receive Christ, how just is it that Christ should
				   refuse to receive you? How reasonable are Christ's terms, who offers to
				   save all those that willingly, or with a good will, accept of him for
				   their Saviour! Who can rationally expect that Christ should force
				   himself upon any man to be his Saviour? Or what can be looked for more
				   reasonable, than that all who would be saved by Christ, should heartily
				   and freely entertain him? And surely it would be very dishonourable for
				   Christ to offer himself upon lower terms.- But I would now proceed,
				
				   Secondly, To show that you are not willing to have Christ for a
				   Saviour. To convince you of it, consider,
				
				   1. How it is possible that you should be willing to accept of Christ as
				   a Saviour from the desert of a punishment that you are not sensible you
				   have deserved. If you are truly willing to accept of Christ as a
				   Saviour, it must be as a sacrifice to make atonement for your guilt.
				   Christ came into the world on this errand, to offer himself as an
				   atonement, to answer for our desert of punishment. But how can you be
				   willing to have Christ for a Saviour from a desert of hell, if you be
				   not sensible that you have a desert of hell? If you have not really
				   deserved everlasting burnings in hell, then the very offer of an
				   atonement for such a desert is an imposition upon you. If you have no
				   such guilt upon you, then the very offer of a satisfaction for that
				   guilt is an injury, because it implies in it a charge of guilt that you
				   are free from. Now therefore it is impossible that a man who is not
				   convinced of his guilt can be willing to accept of such an offer;
				   because he cannot be willing to accept the charge which the offer
				   implies. A man who is not convinced that he has deserved so dreadful a
				   punishment, cannot willingly submit to be charged with it. If he thinks
				   he is willing, it is but a mere forced, feigned business; because in
				   his heart he looks upon himself greatly injured; and therefore he
				   cannot freely accept of Christ, under that notion of a Saviour from the
				   desert of such a punishment; for such an acceptance is an implicit
				   owning that he does deserve such a punishment.
				
				   I do not say, but that men may be willing to be saved from an
				   undeserved punishment; they may rather not suffer it, than suffer it.
				   But a man cannot be willing to accept one at God's hands, under the
				   notion of a Saviour from a punishment deserved from him which he thinks
				   he has not deserved; it is impossible that any one should freely allow
				   a Saviour under that notion. Such an one cannot like the way of
				   salvation by Christ; for if he thinks he has not deserved hell, then he
				   will think that freedom from hell is a debt; and therefore cannot
				   willingly and heartily receive it as a free gift.- If a king should
				   condemn a man to some tormenting death, which the condemned person
				   thought himself not deserving of, but looked upon the sentence as
				   unjust and cruel, and the king, when the time of execution drew nigh,
				   should offer him his pardon, under the notion of a very great act of
				   grace and clemency, the condemned person never could willingly and
				   heartily allow it under that notion, because he judged himself unjustly
				   condemned.
				
				   Now by this it is evident that you are not willing to accept of Christ
				   as your Saviour; because you never yet had such a sense of your own
				   sinfulness, and such a conviction of your great guilt in God 's sight,
				   as to be indeed convinced that you lay justly condemned to the
				   punishment of hell. You never was convinced that you had forfeited all
				   favour, and was in God's hands, and at his sovereign and arbitrary
				   disposal, to be either destroyed or saved, just as he pleased. You
				   never yet was convinced of the sovereignty of God. Hence are there so
				   many objections arising against the justice of your punishment from
				   original sin, and from God's decree, from mercy shown to others, and
				   the like.
				
				   2. That you are not sincerely willing to accept of Christ as your
				   Saviour, appears by this, That you never have been convinced that he is
				   sufficient for the work of your salvation. You never had a sight or
				   sense of any such excellency or worthiness in Christ, as should give
				   such great value to his blood and his mediation with God, as that it
				   was sufficient to be accepted for such exceeding guilty creatures, who
				   have so provoked God, and exposed themselves to such amazing wrath.
				   Saying it is so and allowing it be as others say, is a very different
				   thing from being really convinced of it, and a being made sensible of
				   it in your own heart. The sufficiency of Christ depends upon, or rather
				   consists in his excellency. It is because he is so excellent a person
				   that his blood is of sufficient value to atone for sin, and it is hence
				   that his obedience is so worthy in God's sight; it is also hence that
				   his intercession is so prevalent; and therefore those that never had
				   any spiritual sight or sense of Christ's excellency, cannot be sensible
				   of his sufficiency.
				
				   And that sinners are not convinced that Christ is sufficient for the
				   work he has undertaken, appears most manifestly when they are under
				   great convictions of their sin, and danger of God's wrath. Though it
				   may be before they thought they could allow Christ to be sufficient,
				   (for it is easy to allow any one to be sufficient for our defense at a
				   time when we see no danger,) yet when they come to be sensible of their
				   guilt and God's wrath, what discouraging thoughts do they entertain!
				   How are they ready to draw towards despair, as if there were no hope or
				   help for such wicked creatures as they! The reason is, They have no
				   apprehension or sense of any other way that God's majesty can be
				   vindicated, but only in their misery. To tell them of the blood of
				   Christ signifies nothing, it does not relieve their sinking, despairing
				   hearts. This makes it most evident that they are not convinced that
				   Christ is sufficient to be their Mediator.- And as long as they are
				   unconvinced of this, it is impossible they should be willing to accept
				   of him as their Mediator and Saviour. A man in distressing fear will
				   not willingly betake himself to a fort that he judges not sufficient to
				   defend him from the enemy. A man will not willingly venture out into
				   the ocean in a ship that he suspects is leaky, and will sink before he
				   gets through his voyage.
				
				   3. It is evident that you are not willing to have Christ for your
				   Saviour, because you have so mean an opinion of him, that you durst not
				   trust his faithfulness. One that undertakes to be the Saviour of souls
				   had need be faithful; for if he fails in such a trust, how great is the
				   loss! But you are not convinced of Christ's faithfulness; as is
				   evident, because at such times as when you are in a considerable
				   measure sensible of your guilt and God's anger, you cannot be convinced
				   that Christ is willing to accept of you, or that he stands ready to
				   receive you, if you should come to him, though Christ so much invites
				   you to come to him, and has so fully declared that he will not reject
				   you, if you do come; as particularly, John 6:37. "Him that cometh to
				   me, I will in no wise cast out." Now, there is no man can be heartily
				   willing to trust his eternal welfare in the hands of an unfaithful
				   person, or one whose faithfulness he suspects.
				
				   4. You are not willing to be saved in that way by Christ, as is
				   evident, because you are not willing that your own goodness should be
				   set at nought. In the way of salvation by Christ men's own goodness is
				   wholly set at nought; there is no account at all made of it. Now you
				   cannot be willing to be saved in a way wherein your own goodness is set
				   at nought, as is evident, since you make much of it yourself. You make
				   much of your prayers and pains in religion, and are often thinking of
				   them; how considerable do they appear to you, when you look back upon
				   them! And some of you are thinking how much more you have done than
				   others, and expecting some respect or regard that God should manifest
				   to what you do. Now, if you make so much of what you do yourself, it is
				   impossible that you should be freely willing that God should make
				   nothing of it . As we may see in other things; if a man is proud of a
				   great estate, or if he values himself much upon his honourable office,
				   or his great abilities, it is impossible that he should like it, and
				   heartily approve of it, that others should make light of these things
				   and despise them.
				
				   Seeing therefore it is so evident, that you refuse to accept of Christ
				   as your Saviour, why is Christ to be blamed that he does not save you?
				   Christ has offered himself to you, to be your Saviour in time past, and
				   he continues offering himself still, and you continue to reject him,
				   and yet complain that he does not save you.- So strangely unreasonable,
				   and inconsistent with themselves, are gospel sinners!
				
				   But I expect there are many of you that still object. Such an objection
				   as this, is probably now in the hearts of many here present.
				
				   Objection. If I am not willing to have Christ for my Saviour, I cannot
				   make myself willing.- But I would give an answer to this objection by
				   laying down two things, that must be acknowledged to be exceeding
				   evident.
				
				   1. It is no excuse, that you cannot receive Christ of yourself, unless
				   you would if you could. This is so evident of itself, that it scarce
				   needs any proof. Certainly if persons would not if they could, it is
				   just the same thing as to the blame that lies upon them, whether they
				   can or cannot. If you were willing, and then found that you could not,
				   your being unable would alter the case, and might be some excuse;
				   because then the defect would not be in your will, but only in your
				   ability. But as long as you will not, it is no matter, whether you have
				   ability or no ability.
				
				   If you are not willing to accept of Christ, it follows that you have no
				   sincere willingness to be willing; because the will always necessarily
				   approves of and rests in its own acts. To suppose the contrary, would
				   be to suppose a contradiction; it would be to suppose that a man's will
				   is contrary to itself, or that he wills contrary to what he himself
				   wills. As you are not willing to come to Christ, and cannot make
				   yourself willing, so you have no sincere desire to be willing; and
				   therefore may most justly perish without a Saviour. There is no excuse
				   at all for you; for say what you will about your inability, the seat of
				   your blame lies in your perverse will, that is an enemy to the Saviour.
				   It is in vain for you to tell of your want of power, as long as your
				   will is found defective. If a man should hate you, and smite you in the
				   face, but should tell you at the same time, that he hated you so much,
				   that he could not help choosing and willing so to do, would you take it
				   the more patiently for that? Would not your indignation be rather
				   stirred up the more?
				
				   2. If you would be willing if you could, that is no excuse, unless your
				   unwillingness to be willing be sincere. That which is hypocritical, and
				   does not come from the heart, but is merely forced, ought wholly to be
				   set aside, as worthy of no consideration; because common sense teaches,
				   that what is not hearty, but hypocritical is indeed nothing, being only
				   a show of what is not; but that which is good for nothing, ought to go
				   for nothing. But if you set aside all that is not free, and call
				   nothing a willingness, but a free hearty willingness, then see how the
				   case stands, and whether or no you have not lost all your excuse for
				   standing out against the calls of the gospel. You say you would make
				   yourself willing to accept if you could; but it is not from any good
				   principle that you are willing for that. It is not from any free
				   inclination, or true respect to Christ, or any love to your duty, or
				   any spirit of obedience. It is not from the influence of any real
				   respect, or tendency in your heart, towards any thing good, or from any
				   other principle than such as is in the hearts of devils, and would make
				   them have the same sort of willingness in the same circumstances. It is
				   therefore evident, that there can be no goodness in that would be
				   willing to come to Christ: and that which has no goodness, cannot be an
				   excuse for any badness. If there be no good in it, then it signifies
				   nothing, and weighs nothing, when put into the scales to counterbalance
				   that which is bad.
				
				   Sinners therefore spend their time in foolish arguing and objecting,
				   making much of that which is good for nothing, making those excuses
				   that are not worth offering. It is in vain to keep making objection.
				   You stand justly condemned. The blame lies at your door: Thrust it off
				   from you as often as you will, it will return upon you. Sew fig-leaves
				   as long as you will, your nakedness will appear. You continue wilfully
				   and wickedly rejecting Jesus Christ, and will not have him for your
				   Saviour, and therefore it is sottish madness in you to charge Christ
				   with injustice that he does not save you.
				
				   Here is the sin of unbelief! Thus the guilt of that great sin lies upon
				   you! If you never had thus treated a Saviour, you might most justly
				   have been damned to all eternity: it would but be exactly agreeable to
				   your treatment of God. But besides this, when God, notwithstanding, has
				   offered you his own dear Son, to save you from this endless misery you
				   had deserved, and not only so, but to make you happy eternally in the
				   enjoyment of himself, you have refused him, and would not have him for
				   your Saviour, and still refuse to comply with the offers of the gospel;
				   what can render any person more inexcusable? If you should now perish
				   for ever, what can you have to say?
				
				   Hereby the justice of God in your destruction appears in two respects:
				
				   1. It is more abundantly manifest that it is just that you should be
				   destroyed. Justice never appears so conspicuous as it does after
				   refused and abused mercy. Justice in damnation appears abundantly the
				   more clear and bright, after a wilful rejection of offered salvation.
				   What can an offended prince do more than freely offer pardon to a
				   condemned malefactor? And if he refuses to accept of it, will any one
				   say that his execution is unjust?
				
				   2. God's justice will appear in your greater destruction. Besides the
				   guilt that you would have had if a Saviour never had been offered, you
				   bring that great additional guilt upon you, of most ungratefully
				   refusing offered deliverance. What more base and vile treatment of God
				   can there be, than for you, when justly condemned to eternal misery,
				   and ready to be executed, and God graciously sends his own Son, who
				   comes and knocks at your door with a pardon in his hand, and not only a
				   pardon, but a deed of eternal glory; I say, what can be worse, than for
				   you, out of dislike and enmity against God and his Son, to refuse to
				   accept those benefits at his hands? How justly may the anger of God be
				   greatly incensed and increased by it! When a sinner thus ungratefully
				   rejects mercy, his last error is worse than the first; this is more
				   heinous than all his former rebellion, and may justly bring down more
				   fearful wrath upon him.
				
				   The heinousness of this sin of rejecting a Saviour especially appears
				   in two things:
				
				   1. The greatness of the benefits offered: which appears in the
				   greatness of the deliverance, which is from inexpressible degrees of
				   corruption and wickedness of heart and life, the least degree of which
				   is infinitely evil; and from misery that is everlasting; and in the
				   greatness and glory of the inheritance purchased and offered. Hebrews
				   2:3. "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation."
				
				   2. The wonderfulness of the way in which these benefits are procured
				   and offered. That God should lay help on his own Son, when our case was
				   so deplorable that help could be had in no mere creature; and that he
				   should undertake for us, and should come into the world, and take upon
				   him our nature, and should not only appear in a low state of life, but
				   should die such a death, and endure such torments and contempt for
				   sinners while enemies, how wonderful is it! And what tongue or pen can
				   set forth the greatness of the ingratitude, baseness, and perverseness
				   there is in it, when a perishing sinner that is in the most extreme
				   necessity of salvation, rejects it, after it is procured in such a way
				   as this! That so glorious a person should be thus treated, and that
				   when he comes on so gracious an errand! That he should stand so long
				   offering himself and calling and inviting, as he has done to many of
				   you, and all to no purpose, but all the while be set at nought! Surely
				   you might justly be cast into hell without one more offer of a Saviour!
				   Yea, and thrust down into the lowest hell! Herein you have exceeded the
				   very devils; for they never rejected the offers of such glorious mercy;
				   no, nor of any mercy at all. This will be the distinguishing
				   condemnation of gospel-sinners, John 3:18. "He that believeth not is
				   condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
				   begotten Son of God."- That outward smoothness of your carriage towards
				   Christ, that appearance of respect to him in your looks, your speeches,
				   and gestures, do not argue but that you set him at nought in your
				   heart. There may be much of these outward shows of respect, and yet you
				   be like Judas, that betrayed the Son of man with a kiss; and like those
				   mockers that bowed the knee before him, and at the same time spit in
				   his face.
				
				   III. If God should for ever cast you off and destroy you, it would be
				   agreeable to your treatment of others.- It would be no other than what
				   would be exactly answerable to your behaviour towards your
				   fellow-creatures, that have the same human nature, and are naturally in
				   the same circumstances with you, and that you ought to love as
				   yourself. And that appears especially in two things.
				
				   1. You have many of you been opposite in your spirit to the salvation
				   of others. There are several ways that natural men manifest a spirit of
				   opposition against the salvation of souls. It sometimes appears by a
				   fear that their companions, acquaintances, and equals, will obtain
				   mercy, and so become unspeakably happier than they. It is sometimes
				   manifested by an uneasiness at the news of what others have hopefully
				   obtained. It appears when persons envy others for it, and dislike them
				   the more, and disrelish their talk, and avoid their company, and cannot
				   bear to hear their religious discourse, and especially to receive
				   warnings and counsels from them. And it oftentimes appears by their
				   backwardness to entertain charitable thoughts of them, and by their
				   being brought with difficulty to believe that they have obtained mercy,
				   and a forwardness to listen to any thing that seems to contradict it.
				   The devil hated to own Job's sincerity, Job 1:7, &c. and chapter 2,
				   verses 3, 4, 5. There appears very often much of this spirit of the
				   devil in natural men. Sometimes they are ready to make a ridicule of
				   others' pretended godliness; they speak of the ground of others' hopes,
				   as the enemies of the Jews did of the wall that they built. Nehemiah
				   4:3. "Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, That which they
				   build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall."
				   There are many that join with Sanballat and Tobiah, and are of the same
				   spirit with them. There always was, and always will be, an enmity
				   betwixt the seed of the serpent and the seed of the women. It appeared
				   in Cain, who hated his brother, because he was more acceptable to God
				   than himself; and it appears still in these times, and in this place.
				   There are many that are like the elder brother, who could not bear that
				   the prodigal when he returned should be received with such joy and good
				   entertainment, and was put into a fret by it, both against his brother
				   that had returned, and his father that had made him so welcome. Luke
				   15.
				
				   Thus have many of you been opposite to the salvation of others, who
				   stand in as great necessity of it as you. You have been against their
				   being delivered from everlasting misery, who can bear it no better than
				   you; not because their salvation would do you any hurt, or their
				   damnation help you, any otherwise than as it would gratify that vile
				   spirit that is so much like the spirit of the devil, who, because he is
				   miserable himself, is unwilling that others should be happy. How just
				   therefore is it that God should be opposite to your salvation! If you
				   have so little love or mercy in you as to begrudge your neighbour's
				   salvation, whom you have no cause to hate, but the law of God and
				   nature requires you to love, why is God bound to exercise such infinite
				   love and mercy to you, as to save you at the price of his own blood?
				   you, whom he is no way bound to love, but who have deserved his hatred
				   a thousand and a thousand times? You are not willing that others should
				   be converted, who have behaved themselves injuriously towards you; and
				   yet, will you count it hard if God does not bestow converting grace
				   upon you that have deserved ten thousand times as ill of God, as ever
				   any of your neighbours have of you? You are opposite to God's showing
				   mercy to those that you think have been vicious persons, and are very
				   unworthy of such mercy. Is others' unworthiness a just reason why God
				   should not bestow mercy on them? And yet will God be hard, if,
				   notwithstanding all your unworthiness, and the abominableness of your
				   spirit and practice in his sight, he does not show you mercy? You would
				   have God bestow liberally on you, and upbraid not; but yet when he
				   shows mercy to others, you are ready to upbraid as soon as you hear of
				   it; you immediately are thinking with yourself how ill they have
				   behaved themselves; and it may be your mouths on this occasion are
				   open, enumerating and aggravating the sins they have been guilty of.
				   You would have God bury all your faults, and wholly blot out all your
				   transgressions; but yet if he bestows mercy on others, it may be you
				   will take that occasion to rake up all their old faults that you can
				   think of. You do not much reflect on and condemn yourself for your
				   baseness and unjust spirit towards others, in your opposition to their
				   salvation; you do not quarrel with yourself, and condemn yourself for
				   this; but yet you in your heart will quarrel with God, and fret at his
				   dispensations, because you think he seems opposite to showing mercy to
				   you. One would think that the consideration of these things should for
				   ever stop your mouth.
				
				   2. Consider how you have promoted others' damnation. Many of you, by
				   the bad examples you have set, by corrupting the minds of others, by
				   your sinful conversation, by leading them into or strengthening them in
				   sin, and by the mischief you have done in human society other ways that
				   might be mentioned, have been guilty of those things that have tended
				   to others' damnation. You have heretofore appeared on the side of sin
				   and Satan, and have strengthened their interest, and have been many
				   ways accessary to others' sins, have hardened their hearts, and thereby
				   have done what has tended to the ruin of their souls.- Without doubt
				   there are those here present who have been in a great measure the means
				   of others' damnation. One man may really be a means of others'
				   damnation as well as salvation. Christ charges the scribes and
				   Pharisees with this, Matthew 23:13. "Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven
				   against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them
				   that are entering, to go in." We have no reason to think that this
				   congregation has none in it who are cursed from day to day by poor
				   souls that are roaring out in hell, whose damnation they have been the
				   means of, or have greatly contributed to.- There are many who
				   contribute to their own children's damnation, by neglecting their
				   education, by setting them bad examples, and bringing them up in sinful
				   ways. They take some care of their bodies, but take little care of
				   their poor souls; they provide for them bread to eat, but deny them the
				   bread of life, that their famishing souls stand in need of. And are
				   there no such parents here who have thus treated their children? If
				   their children be not gone to hell, no thanks to them; it is not
				   because they have not done what has tended to their destruction. Seeing
				   therefore you have had no more regard to others' salvation, and have
				   promoted their damnation, how justly might God leave you to perish
				   yourself!
				
				   IV. If God should eternally cast you off, it would but be agreeable to
				   your own behaviour towards yourself; and that in two respects:
				
				   1. In being so careless of your own salvation. You have refused to take
				   care for your salvation, as God has counselled and commanded you from
				   time to time; and why may not God neglect it, now you seek it of him?
				   Is God obliged to be more careful of your happiness, than you are
				   either of your own happiness or his glory? Is God bound to take that
				   care for you, out of love to you, that you will not take for yourself,
				   either from love to yourself, or regard to his authority? How long, and
				   how greatly, have you neglected the welfare of your precious soul,
				   refusing to take pains and deny yourself, or put yourself a little out
				   of your way for your salvation, while God has been calling upon you!
				   Neither your duty to God, nor love to your own soul, were enough to
				   induce you to do little things for your own eternal welfare; and yet do
				   you now expect that God should do great things, putting forth almighty
				   power, and exercising infinite mercy for it? You was urged to take care
				   for your salvation, and not to put it off. You was told that was the
				   best time before you grew older, and that it might be, if you would put
				   it off, God would not hear you afterwards; but yet you would not
				   hearken; you would run the venture of it. Now how justly might God
				   order it so, that it should be too late, leaving you to seek in vain!
				   You was told, that you would repent of it if you delayed; but you would
				   not hear: how justly therefore may God give you cause to repent of it,
				   by refusing to show you mercy now! If God sees you going on in ways
				   contrary to his commands and his glory, and requires you to forsake
				   them, and tells you that they tend to the destruction of your own soul,
				   and therefore counsels you to avoid them, and you refuse; how just
				   would it be if God should be provoked by it, henceforward to be as
				   careless of the good of your soul as you are yourself!
				
				   2. You have not only neglected your salvation, but you have wilfully
				   taken direct courses to undo yourself. You have gone on in those ways
				   and practices which have directly tended to your damnation, and have
				   been perverse and obstinate it. You cannot plead ignorance; you had all
				   the light set before you that you could desire. God told you that you
				   was undoing yourself; but yet you would do it. He told you that the
				   path you was going in led to destruction, and counselled you to avoid
				   it; but you would not hearken. How justly therefore may God leave you
				   to be undone! You have obstinately persisted to travel in the way that
				   leads to hell for a long time, contrary to God's continual counsels and
				   commands, till it may be at length you are got almost to your journey's
				   end, and are come near to hell's gate, and so begin to be sensible of
				   your danger and misery; and not account it unjust and hard if God will
				   not deliver you! You have destroyed yourself, and destroyed yourself
				   wilfully, contrary to God's repeated counsels, yea, and destroyed
				   yourself in fighting against God. Now therefore, why do you blame any
				   but yourself if you are destroyed? If you will undo yourself in
				   opposing God, and while God opposes you by his calls and counsels, and,
				   it may be too, by the convictions of his Spirit, what can you object
				   against it, if God now leaves you to be undone? You would have your own
				   way, and did not like that God should oppose you in it, and your way
				   was to ruin your own soul; how just therefore is it, if, now at length,
				   God ceases to oppose you, and falls in with you, and lets your soul be
				   ruined; and as you would destroy yourself, so should put to his hand to
				   destroy you too! The ways you went on in had a natural tendency to your
				   misery: if you would drink poison in opposition to God, and in contempt
				   of him and his advice, who can you blame but yourself if you are
				   poisoned, and so perish? If you would run into the fire against all
				   restraints both of God's mercy and authority, you must even blame
				   yourself if you are burnt.
				
				   Thus I have proposed some things to your consideration, which, if you
				   are not exceeding blind, senseless, and perverse, will stop your mouth,
				   and convince you that you stand justly condemned before God; and that
				   he would in no wise deal hardly with you, but altogether justly, in
				   denying you any mercy, and in refusing to hear your prayers, though you
				   pray never so earnestly, and never so often, and continue in it never
				   so long. God may utterly disregard your tears and moans, your heavy
				   heart, your earnest desires, and great endeavours; and he may cast you
				   into eternal destruction, without any regard to your welfare, denying
				   you converting grace, and giving you over to Satan, and at last cast
				   you into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, to be there to
				   eternity, having no rest day or night, for ever glorifying his justice
				   upon you in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the
				   Lamb.
				
				   Objection. But here many may still object, (for I am sensible it is a
				   hard thing to stop sinners' mouths,) "God shows mercy to others that
				   have done these things as well as I, yea, that have done a great deal
				   worse than I."
				
				   Answer. 1. That does not prove that God is any way bound to show mercy
				   to you, or them either. If God bestows it on others, he does not so
				   because he is bound to bestow it: he might if he had pleased, with
				   glorious justice, have denied it them. If God bestows it on some, that
				   does not prove that he is bound to bestow it on any; and if he is bound
				   to bestow it on none, then he is not bound to bestow it on you. God is
				   in debt to none; and if he gives to some that he is not in debt to,
				   because it is his pleasure, that does not bring him into debt to
				   others. It alters not the case as to you, whether others have it, or
				   have it not: you do not deserve damnation the less, than if mercy never
				   had been bestowed on any at all. Matthew 20:15. "Is thine eye evil,
				   because mine is good?"
				
				   2. If this objection be good, then the exercise of God's mercy is not
				   in his own right, and his grace is not his own to give. That which God
				   may not dispose of as he pleases, is not his own; for that which is
				   one's own, is at his own disposal: but if it be not God's own, then he
				   is not capable of making a gift or present of it to any one; it is
				   impossible to give what is a debt.- What is it that you would make of
				   God? Must the great God be tied up, that he must not use his own
				   pleasure in bestowing his own gifts, but if he bestows them on one,
				   must be looked upon obliged to bestow them on another? Is not God
				   worthy to have the same right, with respect to the gifts of his grace,
				   that a man has to his money or goods? Is it because God is not so
				   great, and should be more in subjection than man, that this cannot be
				   allowed him? If any of you see cause to show kindness to a neighbour,
				   do all the rest of your neighbours come to you, and tell you, that you
				   owe them so much as you have given to such a man? But this is the way
				   that you deal with God, as though God were not worthy to have as
				   absolute a property in his goods, as you have in yours.
				
				   At this rate God cannot make a present of any thing; he has nothing of
				   his own to bestow: if he has a mind to show peculiar favour to some, or
				   to lay some particular persons under peculiar obligations to him, he
				   cannot do it; because he has no special gift at his own disposal. If
				   this be the case, why do you pray to God to bestow saving grace upon
				   you? If God does not do fairly to deny it you, because he bestows it on
				   others, then it is not worth your while to pray for it, but you may go
				   and tell him that he has bestowed it on others as bad or worse than
				   you, and so demand it of him as a debt. And at this rate persons never
				   need to thank God for salvation, when it is bestowed; for what occasion
				   is there to thank God for that which was not at his own disposal, and
				   that he could not fairly have denied? The thing at bottom is, that men
				   have low thoughts of God, and high thoughts of themselves; and
				   therefore it is that they look upon God as having so little right, and
				   they so much. Matthew 20:15. "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will
				   with mine own?"
				
				   3. God may justly show greater respect to others than to you, for you
				   have shown greater respect to others than to God. You have rather
				   chosen to offend God than men. God only shows a greater respect to
				   others, who are by nature your equals, than to you; but you have shown
				   a greater respect to those that are infinitely inferior to God than to
				   him. You have shown a greater regard to wicked men than to God; you
				   have honoured them more, loved them better, and adhered to them rather
				   than to him. Yea, you have honoured the devil, in many respects, more
				   than God: you have chosen his will and his interest, rather than God's
				   will and his glory: you have chosen a little worldly pelf, rather than
				   God: you have set more by a vile lust than by him: you have chosen
				   these things, and rejected God. You have set your heart on these
				   things, and cast God behind your back: and where is the injustice if
				   God is pleased to show greater respect to others than to you, or if he
				   chooses others and rejects you? You have shown greater respect to vile
				   and worthless things, and no respect to God's glory; and why may not
				   God set his love on others, and have no respect to your happiness? You
				   have shown great respect to others, and not to God, whom you are laid
				   under infinite obligations to respect above all; and why may not God
				   show respect to others, and not to you, who never have laid him under
				   the least obligation?
				
				   And will you not be ashamed, notwithstanding all these things, still to
				   open your mouth, to object and cavil about the decrees of God, and
				   other things that you cannot fully understand. Let the decrees of God
				   be what they will, that alters not the case as to your liberty, any
				   more than if God had only foreknown. And why is God to blame for
				   decreeing things? Especially since he decrees nothing but good. How
				   unbecoming an infinitely wise Being would it have been to have made a
				   world, and let things run at random, without disposing events, or
				   fore-ordering how they should come to pass? And what is that to you,
				   how God has fore-ordered things, as long as your constant experience
				   teaches you, that it does not hinder your doing what you choose to do.
				   This you know, and your daily practice and behaviour amongst men
				   declares that you are fully sensible of it with respect to yourself and
				   others. Still to object, because there are some things in God's
				   dispensations above your understanding, is exceedingly unreasonable.
				   Your own conscience charges you with great guilt, and with those things
				   that have been mentioned, let the secret things of God be what they
				   will. Your conscience charges you with those vile dispositions, and
				   that base behaviour towards God, that you would at any time most highly
				   resent in your neighbour towards you, and that not a whit the less for
				   any concern those secret counsels and mysterious dispensations of God
				   may have in the matter. It is in vain for you to exalt yourself against
				   an infinitely great, and holy, and just God. If you continue in it, it
				   will be to your eternal shame and confusion, when hereafter you shall
				   see at whose door all the blame of your misery lies.
				
				   I will finish what I have to say to natural men in the application of
				   this doctrine, with a caution not to improve the doctrine to
				   discouragement. For though it would be righteous in God for ever to
				   cast you off, and destroy you, yet it would also be just in God to save
				   you, in and through Christ, who has made complete satisfaction for all
				   sin. Romans 3:25, 26. "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation,
				   through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
				   remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to
				   declare, I say, at this time his righteousness, that he might be just,
				   and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus." Yea, God may,
				   through this Mediator, not only justly, but honourably, show you mercy.
				   The blood of Christ is so precious, that it is fully sufficient to pay
				   the debt you have contracted, and perfectly to vindicate the Divine
				   Majesty from all the dishonour cast upon it, by these many great sins
				   of yours that have been mentioned. It was as great, and indeed a much
				   greater thing, for Christ to die, than it would have been for you and
				   all mankind to have burnt in hell to all eternity. Of such dignity and
				   excellency is Christ in the eyes of God, that, seeing he has suffered
				   so much for poor sinners, God is willing to be at peace with them,
				   however vile and unworthy they have been, and on how many accounts
				   soever the punishment would be just. So that you need not be at all
				   discouraged from seeking mercy, for there is enough in Christ.
				
				   Indeed it would not become the glory of God's majesty to show mercy to
				   you, so sinful and vile a creature, for any thing that you have done;
				   for such worthless and despicable things as your prayers, and other
				   religious performances. It would be very dishonourable and unworthy of
				   God so to do, and it is in vain to expect it. He will show mercy only
				   on Christ's account; and that, according to his sovereign pleasure, on
				   whom he pleases, when he pleases, and in what manner he pleases. You
				   cannot bring him under obligation by your works; do what you will, he
				   will not look on himself obliged. But if it be his pleasure, he can
				   honourably show mercy through Christ to any sinner of you all, not one
				   in this congregation excepted.- Therefore here is encouragement for you
				   still to seek and wait, notwithstanding all your wickedness; agreeable
				   to Samuel's speech to the children of Israel, when they were terrified
				   with the thunder and rain that God sent, and when guilt stared them in
				   the face, 1 Samuel 12:20. "Fear not; ye have done all this wickedness;
				   yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all
				   your heart."
				
				   I would conclude this discourse by putting the godly in mind of the
				   freeness and wonderfulness of the grace of God towards them. For such
				   were the same of you.- The case was just so with you as you have heard;
				   you had such a wicked heart, you lived such a wicked life, and it would
				   have been most just with God for ever to have cast you off: but he has
				   had mercy upon you; he hath made his glorious grace appear in your
				   everlasting salvation. You had no love to God; but yet he has exercised
				   unspeakable love to you. You have contemned God, and set light by him:
				   but so great a value has God's grace set on you and your happiness,
				   that you have been redeemed at the price of the blood of his own Son.
				   You chose to be with Satan in his service; but yet God hath made you a
				   joint heir with Christ of his glory. You was ungrateful for past
				   mercies; yet God not only continued those mercies, but bestowed
				   unspeakably greater mercies upon you. You refused to hear when God
				   called; yet God heard you when you called. You abused the infiniteness
				   of God's mercy to encourage yourself in sin against him; yet God has
				   manifested the infiniteness of that mercy, in the exercises of it
				   towards you. You have rejected Christ, and set him at nought; and yet
				   he is become your Saviour. You have neglected your own salvation; but
				   God has not neglected it. You have destroyed yourself; but yet in God
				   has been your help. God has magnified his free grace towards you, and
				   not to others; because he has chosen you, and it hath pleased him to
				   set his love upon you.
				
				   O! what cause is here for praise! What obligations you are under to
				   bless the Lord who hath dealt bountifully with you, and magnify his
				   holy name! What cause for you to praise God in humility, to walk humbly
				   before him. Ezekiel 16:63. "That thou mayest remember and be
				   confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame,
				   when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the
				   Lord God!" You shall never open your mouth in boasting, or
				   self-justification; but lie the lower before God for his mercy to you.
				   You have reason, the more abundantly, to open your mouth in God's
				   praises, that they may be continually in your mouth, both here and to
				   all eternity, for his rich, unspeakable, and sovereign mercy to you,
				   whereby he, and he alone, hath made you to differ from others.

				CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE
				
				    Hebrews 5:12 -- For Then for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
				    that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of
				    God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   These words are a complaint, which the apostle makes against the
				   Christian Hebrews, for their want of such proficiency in the knowledge
				   of the doctrines and mysteries of religion, as might have been expected
				   of them. The apostle complains, that they had not made that progress in
				   their acquaintance with the things taught in the oracles of God, which
				   they ought to have made. And he means to reprove them, not merely for
				   their deficiency in spiritual and experimental knowledge of divine
				   things, but for their deficiency in a doctnnal acquaintance with the
				   principles of religion, and the truths of Christ Ian divinity; as is
				   evident by the manner in which the apostle introduces this reproof. The
				   occasion of his introducing it is this: In the next text but one
				   preceding. he mentions Christ as being " Called of God an high priest
				   after the order of Melchizedek." In the Old Testament, the oracles of
				   God, Melchizedek was held forth as an eminent type of Christ; and the
				   account we there have of him contains many gospel mysteries. These
				   mysteries the apostle was willing to point out to the Christian
				   Hebrews; but he apprehended, that through their weakness in knowledge,
				   they would not understand him; and therefore breaks off for the present
				   from saying any thing about Melchizedek, thus (ver. 11.) "Of whom we
				   have many things to say, and hard to be uttered; seeing ye are all dull
				   of hearing;" i.e. there are many things concerning Melchizedek which
				   contain wonderful gospel-mysteries, and which I would take notice of to
				   you, were it not that I am afraid, that through your dulness,and
				   backwardness in understanding these things, you would only be puzzled
				   and confounded by my discourse, and so receive no benefit; and that it
				   would be too hard for you, as meat that is too strong.
				
				   Then come in the words of the text: " For when for the time ye ought to
				   be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first
				   principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of
				   milk, and not of strong meat." As much as to say, Indeed it might have
				   been expected of you, that you should have known enough of the Holy
				   Scriptures, to be able to understand and digest such mysteries: but it
				   is not so with you. The apostle speaks of their proficiency in such
				   knowledge as is conveyed by human teaching: as appears by that
				   expression, " When for the time ye ought to be teachers;" which
				   includes not only a practical and experimental, but also a doctrinal,
				   knowledge of the truths and mysteries of religion.
				
				   Again, the apostle speaks of such knowledge, whereby Christians are
				   enabled to understand those things in divinity which are more abstruse
				   and difficult to be understood, and which require great skill in things
				   of this nature. This is more fully expressed in the two next verses: "
				   For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
				   righteousness; for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that
				   are of full age, even those who, by reason of use, have their senses
				   exercised to discern both good and evil." It is such knowledge, that
				   proficiency in it shall carry persons beyond the first principles of
				   religion. As here; " Ye have need that one teach you again which be the
				   first principles of the oracles of God." Therefore the apostle, in the
				   beginning of the next chapter, advises them " to leave the first
				   principles of the doctrine of Christ, and to go on unto perfection."
				
				   We may observe that the fault of this defect appears, in that they had
				   not made proficiency according to their time.-For the time, they ought
				   to have been teachers. As they were Christians, their business was to
				   learn and gain Christian knowledge. They were scholars in the school of
				   Christ; and if they had improved their time in learning, as they ought
				   to have done, they might, by the time when the apostle wrote, have been
				   fit to be teachers in this school. To whatever business any one is
				   devoted, it may be expected that his perfection in it shall be
				   answerable to the time he has had to learn and perfect
				   himself.-Christians should not always remain babes, but should grow in
				   Christian knowledge; and leaving the food of babes, they should learn
				   to digest strong meat.
				
				  DOCTRINE
				
				   Every Christian should make a business of endeavoring to grow in
				   knowledge in divinity.-This is indeed esteemed the business of divines
				   and ministers: it is commonly thought to be their work, by the study of
				   the Scriptures, and other instructive books, to gain knowledge; and
				   most seem to think that it may be left to them, as what belongeth not
				   to others. But if the apostle had entertained this notion, he would
				   never have blamed the Christian Hebrews for not having acquired
				   knowledge enough to be teachers. Or if he had thought, that this
				   concerned Christians in general only as a thing by the by, and that
				   their time should not in a considerable measure be taken up with this
				   business; he never would have so much blamed them, that their
				   proficiency in knowledge had not been answerable to the time which they
				   had had to learn.
				
				   In handling this subject, I shall show-what is intended by
				   divinity-what kind of knowledge in divinity is intended-why knowledge
				   in divinity is necessary. And why all Christians should make a business
				   of endeavouring to grow in this knowledge.
				
				   SECT. I
				   What is intended by divinity, as the object of Christian knowledge
				
				   VARIOUS definitions have been given of this subject by those who have
				   treated on it. I shall not now stand to inquire which, according to the
				   rules of art, is the most accurate definition; but shall so define or
				   describe it, as I think has the greatest tendency to convey a proper
				   notion of it.-It is that science or doctrine which comprehends all
				   those truths and rules which concern the great business of religion.
				
				   There are various kinds of arts and sciences taught and learned in the
				   schools, which are conversant about various objects; about the works of
				   nature in general, as philosophy; or the visible heavens, as astronomy;
				   or the sea, as navigation; or the earth, as geography; or the body of
				   man, as physic and anatomy; or the soul of man. with regard to its
				   natural powers and qualities, as logic and pneumatology; or about human
				   government, as politics and jurisprudence. But one science, or kind of
				   knowledge and doctrine, is above all the rest; as it treats concerning
				   God and the great business of religion. Divinity is not learned, as
				   other sciences, merely by the improvement of man's natural reason, but
				   is taught by God himself in a book full of instruction, which he hath
				   given us for that end. This is the rule which God hath given to the
				   world to be their guide in searching after this kind of knowledge, and
				   is a summary of all things of this nature needful for us to know. Upon
				   this account divinity is rather called a doctrine, than an art or
				   science.
				
				   Indeed there is what is called natural religion. There are many truths
				   concerning God, and our duty to him, which are evident by the light of
				   nature. But Christian divinity, properly so called, is not evident by
				   the light of nature; it depends on revelation. Such are our
				   circumstances now in our fallen state that nothing which it is needful
				   for us to know concerning God is manifest by the light of nature, in
				   the manner in which it is necessary for us to know it. For the
				   knowledge of no truth in divinity is of significance to us, any
				   otherwise than as it some way or other belongs to the gospel-scheme, or
				   as it relates to a Mediator. But the light of nature teaches us no
				   truth in this matter. Therefore it cannot be said, that we come to the
				   knowledge of any part of Christian truth by the light of nature. It is
				   only the word of God, contained in the Old and New Testament, which
				   teaches us Christian divinity.
				
				   This comprehends all that is taught in the Scriptures, and so all that
				   we need know, or is to be known, concerning God and Jesus Christ,
				   concerning our duty to God, and our happiness in God. Divinity is
				   commonly defined, the doctrine of living to God; and by some who seem
				   to be more accurate, the doctrine of living to God by Christ. It
				   comprehends all Christian doctrines as they are in Jesus, and all
				   Christian rules directing us in living to God by Christ. There is no
				   one doctrine, no promise, no rule, but what some way or other relates
				   to the Christian and divine life, or our living to God by Christ. They
				   all relate to this, in two respects, viz. as they tend to promote our
				   living to God here in this world, in a life of faith and holiness, and
				   also as they tend to bring us to a life of perfect holiness and
				   happiness, in the full enjoyment of God hereafter.
				
				   SECT. II
				   What kind of knowledge in divinity, is intended in the doctrine
				
				   THERE are two kinds of knowledge of divine truth, viz. speculative and
				   practical, or in other terms, natural and spiritual. The former remains
				   only in the head. No other faculty but the understanding is concerned
				   in it. It consists in having a natural or rational knowledge of the
				   things of religion, or such a knowledge as is to be obtained by the
				   natural exercise of our own faculties, without any special illumination
				   of the Spirit of God. The latter rests not entirely in the head, or in
				   the speculative ideas of things; but the heart is concerned in it: it
				   principally consists in the sense of the heart. The mere intellect,
				   without the will or the inclination, is not the seat of it. And it may
				   not only be called seeing, but feeling or tasting. Thus there is a
				   difference between having a right speculative notion of the doctrines
				   contained in the word of God, and having a due sense of them in the
				   heart. In the former consists the speculative or natural knowledge, in
				   the latter consists the spiritual or practical knowledge of them.
				
				   Neither of these is intended in the doctrine exclusively of the other:
				   but it is intended that we should seek the former in order to the
				   latter. The latter, or the spiritual and practical, is of the greatest
				   importance; for a speculative without a spiritual knowledge, is to no
				   purpose, but to make our condemnation the greater. Yet a speculative
				   knowledge is also of infinite importance in this respect, that without
				   it we can have no spiritual or practical knowledge.
				
				   I have already shown, that the apostle speaks not only of a spiritual
				   knowledge, but of such as can be acquired, and communicated from one to
				   another. Yet it is not to be thought, that he means this exclusively of
				   the other. But he would have the Christian Hebrews seek the one, in
				   order to the other. Therefore
				
				   the former is first and most directly intended; it is intended that
				   Christians should, by reading and other proper means, seek a good
				   rational knowledge of the things of divinity: while the latter is more
				   indirectly intended, since it is to be sought by the other. But I
				   proceed to
				
				   SECT. III
				   The usefulness and necessity of the knowledge of divine truths
				
				   THERE is no other way by which any means of grace whatsoever can be of
				   any benefit, but by knowledge. All teaching is in vain, without
				   learning. Therefore the preaching of the gospel would be wholly to no
				   purpose, if it conveyed no knowledge to the mind. There is an order of
				   men which Christ has appointed on purpose to be teachers in his church.
				   But they teach in vain, if no knowledge in these things is gained by
				   their teaching. It is impossible that their teaching and preaching
				   should be a mean of grace, or of any good in the hearts of their
				   hearers, any otherwise than by knowledge imparted to the understanding.
				   Otherwise it would be of as much benefit to the auditory, if the
				   minister should preach in some unknown tongue. All the difference is,
				   that preaching in a known tongue conveys something to the
				   understanding, which preaching in an unknown tongue cloth not. On this
				   account, such preaching must be unprofitable. In such things men
				   receive nothing, when they understand nothing; and are not at all
				   edified, unless some knowledge be conveyed; agreeable to the apostle's
				   arguing, I Cor. xiv. 2,6.
				
				   No speech can be a mean of grace, but by conveying knowledge. Otherwise
				   the speech is as much lost as if there had been no man there, and if he
				   that spoke, had spoken only into the air; as it follows in the passage
				   just quoted, ver. 6,10. God deals with man as with a rational creature;
				   and when faith is in exercise, it is not about something he knows not
				   what. Therefore hearing is absolutely necessary to faith; because
				   hearing is necessary to understanding, Rom. x. 14. " How shall they
				   believe in him of whom they have not heard?" In like manner, there can
				   be no love without knowledge. It is not according to the nature of the
				   human soul, to love an object which is entirely unknown.
				
				   The heart cannot be set upon an object of which there is no idea in the
				   understanding. The reasons which induce the soul to love, must first be
				   understood, before they can have a reasonable influence on the heart.
				
				   God hath given us the Bible, which is a book of instructions. But this
				   book can be of no manner of profit to us, any otherwise than as it
				   conveys some knowledge to the mind: it can profit us no more than if it
				   were written in the Chinese or Tartarian language, of which we know not
				   one word. So the sacraments of the gospel can have a proper effect no
				   other way, than by conveying some knowledge. They represent certain
				   things by visible signs. And what is the end of signs, but to convey
				   some knowledge of the things signified? Such is the nature of man, that
				   no object can come at the heart but through the door of the
				   understanding: and there can be no spiritual knowledge of that of which
				   there is not first a rational knowledge. It is impossible that any one
				   should see the truth or excellency of any doctrine of the gospel, who
				   knows not what that doctrine is. A man cannot see the wonderful
				   excellency and love of Christ in doing such and such things for
				   sinners, unless his understanding be first informed how those things
				   were done. He cannot have a taste of the sweetness and excellency of
				   divine truth, unless he first have a notion that there is such a thing.
				
				   Without knowledge in divinity, none would differ from the most ignorant
				   and barbarous heathens. The heathens remain in gross darkness, because
				   they are not instructed, and have not obtained the knowledge of divine
				   truths.
				
				   If men have no knowledge of these things, the faculty of reason in them
				   will be wholly in vain. The faculty of reason and understanding was
				   given for actual understanding and knowledge. If a man have no actual
				   knowledge, the faculty or capacity of knowing is of no use to him. And
				   if he have actual knowledge, yet if he be destitute of the knowledge of
				   those things which are the last end of his being, and for the sake of
				   the knowledge of which he had more understanding given him than the
				   beasts; then still his faculty of reason is in vain; he might as well
				   have been a beast as a man. But divine subjects are the things, to know
				   which we had the faculty of reason given us. They are the things which
				   appertain to the end of our being, and to the great business for which
				   we are made. Therefore a man cannot have
				
				   his faculty of understanding to any good purpose, further than he hath
				   knowledge of divine truth.
				
				   So that this kind of knowledge is absolutely necessary.-Other kinds of
				   knowledge may be very useful. Some other sciences, such as astronomy,
				   natural philosophy, and geography, may be very excellent in their kind.
				   But the knowledge of this divine science is infinitely more useful and
				   important than that of all other sciences whatever.
				
				   SECT. IV
				   Why all Christians should make a business of endeavouring to grow in
				   the knowledge of divinity
				
				   CHRISTIANS ought not to content themselves with such degrees of
				   knowledge of divinity as they have already obtained. It should not
				   satisfy them, as they know as much as is absolutely necessary to
				   salvation, but should seek to make progress.
				
				   This endeavour to make progress in such knowledge ought not to be
				   attended to as a thing by the bye, but all Christians should make a
				   business of it. They should look upon it as a part of their daily
				   business, and no small part of it neither. It should be attended to as
				   a considerable part of the work of their high calling.-For
				
				   1. Our business should doubtless much consist in employing those
				   faculties, by which we are distinguished from the beasts, about those
				   things which are the main end of those faculties. The reason why we
				   have faculties superior to those of the brutes given us, is, that we
				   are indeed designed for a superior employment. That which the Creator
				   intended should be our main employment, is something above what he
				   intended the beast for, and therefore hath given us superior powers.
				   Therefore, without doubt, it should be a considerable part of our
				   business to improve those superior faculties. But the faculty by which
				   we are chiefly distinguished from the brutes, is the faculty of
				   understanding. It follows then, that we should make it our chief
				   business to improve this faculty, and should by no means prosecute it
				   as a business by the bye. For us to make the improvement of this
				   faculty a business by the bye, is in effect for us to make the faculty
				   of understanding itself a by,faculty, if I may so speak, a faculty of
				   less importance than others: whereas indeed it is the highest faculty
				   we have.
				
				   But we cannot make a business of the improvement of our intellectual
				   faculty, any otherwise than by making a business of improving ourselves
				   in actual knowledge. So that those who make not this very much their
				   business; but instead of improving their understanding to acquire
				   knowledge, are chiefly devoted to their inferior power-to please their
				   senses, and gratify their animal appetites-not only behave themselves
				   in a manner not becoming Christians, but also act as if they had
				   forgotten that they are men, and that God hath set them above the
				   brutes, by giving them understanding.
				
				   God hath given to man some things in common with the brutes, as his
				   outward senses, his bodily appetites, a capacity of bodily pleasure and
				   pain, and other animal faculties: and some things he hath given him
				   superior to the brutes, the chief of which is a faculty of
				   understanding and reason. Now God never gave man these faculties to be
				   subject to those which he hath in common with the brutes. This would be
				   great confusion, and equivalent to making man to be a servant of the
				   beasts. On the contrary, he has given those inferior powers to be
				   employed in subserviency to man's understanding; and therefore it must
				   be a great part of man's principal business to improve his
				   understanding by acquiring knowledge. If so, then it will follow, that
				   it should be a main part of his business to improve his understanding
				   in acquiring divine knowledge, or the knowledge of the things of
				   divinity: for the knowledge of these things is the principal end of
				   this faculty. God gave man the faculty of understanding, chiefly, that
				   he might understand divine things.
				
				   The wiser heathens were sensible that the main business of man was the
				   improvement and exercise of his understanding. But they knew not the
				   object about which the understanding should chiefly be employed. That
				   science which many of them thought should chiefly employ the
				   understanding, was philosophy; and accordingly they made it their chief
				   business to study it. But we who enjoy the light of the gospel are more
				   happy; we are not left, as to this particular, in the dark. God hath
				   told us about what things we should chiefly employ our understandings,
				   having given us a book full of divine instructions, holding forth many
				   glorious objects about which all rational creatures should chiefly
				   employ their understandings. These instructions are accommodated to
				   persons of all capacities and conditions, and proper to be studied, not
				   only by men of reaming, but by persons of every character, learned and
				   unlearned, young and old, men and women. Therefore the acquisition of
				   knowledge in these things should be a main business of all those who
				   have the advantage of enjoying the Holy Scriptures.
				
				   2. The truths of divinity are of superlative excellency, and are worthy
				   that all should make a business of endeavouring to grow in the
				   knowledge of them. They are as much above those things which are
				   treated of in other sciences, as heaven is above the earth. God
				   himself, the eternal Three in one, is the chief object of this science;
				   and next Jesus Christ, as God,man and Mediator, and the glorious work
				   of redemption, the most glorious work that ever was wrought: then the
				   great things of the heavenly world, the glorious and eternal
				   inheritance purchased by Christ, and promised in the gospel; the work
				   of the Holy Spirit of God on the hearts of men; our duty to God, and
				   the way in which we ourselves may become like angels, and like God
				   himself in our measure. All these are objects of this science.
				
				   Such things as these have been the main subject of the study of the
				   holy patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, and the most excellent men
				   that ever existed; and they are also the subject of study to the angels
				   in heaven; 1 Pet. i. 10,12. They are so excellent and worthy to be
				   known, that the knowledge of them will richly pay for all the pains and
				   labour of an earnest seeking of it. If there were a great treasure of
				   gold and pearls accidentally found, and opened with such circumstances
				   that all might have as much as they could gather; would not every one
				   think it worth his while to make a business of gathering while it
				   should last? But that treasure of divine knowledge, which is contained
				   in the Scriptures, and is provided for every one to gather to himself
				   as much of it as he can, is far more rich than any one of gold and
				   pearls. How busy are all sorts of men, all over the world, in getting
				   riches! But this knowledge is a far better kind of riches, than that
				   after which they so diligently and laboriously pursue.
				
				   3. Divine truths not only concern ministers, but are of infinite
				   importance to all Christians. It is not with the doctrine of divinity
				   as it is with the doctrines of philosophy and other sciences. These
				   last are generally speculative points, which are of little concern in
				   human life; and it very little alters the case as to our temporal or
				   spiritual interests, whether we know them or not. Philosophers differ
				   about them, some being of one opinion, and others of another. And while
				   they are engaged in warm disputes about them, others may well leave
				   them to dispute among themselves, without troubling their heads much
				   about them; it being of little concern to them, whether the one or the
				   other be in the right.-But it is not thus in matters of divinity. The
				   doctrines of this nearly concern every one. They are about those things
				   which relate to every man's eternal salvation and happiness. The common
				   people cannot say, Let us leave these matters to ministers and divines;
				   let them dispute them out among themselves as they can; they concern
				   not us: for they are of infinite importance to every man. Those
				   doctrines which relate to the essence, attributes, and subsistencies of
				   God, concern all; as it is of infinite importance to common people, as
				   well as to ministers, to know what kind of being God is. For he is a
				   Being who hath made us all, " in whom we live, and move, and have our
				   being;" who is the Lord of all; the Being to whom we are all
				   accountable; who is the last end of our being, and the only fountain of
				   our happiness.
				
				   The doctrines also which relate to Jesus Christ and his mediation, his
				   incarnation, his life and death, his resurrection and ascension, his
				   sitting at the right hand of the Father, his satisfaction and
				   intercession, infinitely concern common people as well as divines. They
				   stand in as much need of this Saviour, and of an interest in his person
				   and offices, and the things which he hath done and suffered, as
				   ministers and divines.-The same may be said of the doctrines which
				   relate to the manner of a sinner's justification, or the way in which
				   he becomes interested in the mediation of Christ. They equally concern
				   all; for all stand in equal necessity of justification before God. That
				   eternal condemnation, to which we are all naturally exposed, is equally
				   dreadful. So with respect to those doctrines which relate to the work
				   of the Spirit of God on the heart, in the application of redemption in
				   our effectual calling and sanctification, all are equally concerned in
				   them. There is no doctrine of divinity whatever, which doth not some
				   way or other concern the eternal interest of every Christian.
				
				   4. We may argue in favour of the same position, from the great things
				   which God hath done in order to give us instruction in these things. As
				   to other sciences, he hath left us to ourselves, to the light of our
				   own reason. But divine things being of infinitely greater importance to
				   us, he hath not left us to an uncertain guide; but hath himself given
				   us a revelation of the truth in these matters, and hath done very great
				   things to convey and confirm it to us; raising up many prophets in
				   different ages, immediately inspiring them with his Holy Spirit, and
				   confirming their doctrine with innumerable miracles or wonderful works
				   out of the established course of nature. Yea, he raised up a succession
				   of prophets, which was upheld for several ages.
				
				   It was very much for this end that God separated the people of Israel,
				   in so wonderful a manner, from all other people, and kept them
				   separate; that to them he might commit the oracles of God, and that
				   from them they might be communicated to the world. He hath also often
				   sent angels to bring divine instructions to men; and hath often himself
				   appeared in miraculous symbols or representations of his presence: and
				   now in these last days hath sent his own Son into the world, to be his
				   great prophet, to teach us divine truth. Heb. i. 1, etc. God hath given
				   us a book of divine instructions, which contains the sum of divinity.
				   Now, these things hath God done, not only for the instruction of
				   ministers and men of learning; but for the instruction of all men, of
				   all sorts, learned and unlearned, men, women, and children. And
				   certainly if God cloth such great things to teach us, we ought to do
				   something to learn.
				
				   God giving instructions to men in these things, is not a business by
				   the by; but what he hath undertaken and prosecuted in a course of great
				   and wonderful dispensations, as an affair in which his heart hath been
				   greatly engaged; which is sometimes in Scripture signified by the
				   expression of God's rising early to teach us, and to send us prophets
				   and teachers. Jer. vii. 25. " Since that day that your fathers came
				   forth out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, I have even sent unto
				   you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early, and sending
				   them." And ver. 13. " I spake unto you; rising up early, and speaking."
				   This is a figurative speech, signifying, that God hath done this as a
				   business of great importance, in which he took great care, and had his
				   heart much engaged; because persons are wont to rise early to prosecute
				   such business as they are earnestly engaged in. --If God hath been so
				   engaged in teaching, certainly we should not be negligent in learning;
				   but should make growing in knowledge a great part of the business of
				   our lives.
				
				   5. It may be argued from the abundance of the instructions which God
				   hath given us, from the largeness of that book which God hath given to
				   teach us divinity, and from the great variety that is therein
				   contained. Much was taught by Moses of old, which we have transmitted
				   down to us; after that, other books were from time to time added; much
				   is taught us by David and Solomon; and many and excellent are the
				   instructions communicated by the prophets: yet God did not think all
				   this enough, but after this sent Christ and his apostles, by whom there
				   is added a great and excellent treasure to that holy book, which is to
				   be our rule in the study of this important subject.
				
				   This book was written for the use of all; all are directed to search
				   the Scriptures, John v. 39. " Search the Scriptures, for in them ye
				   think ye have eternal life; and they are they that testify of me;" and
				   Isa. xxxiv. 16. "Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and read." They
				   that read and understand are pronounced blessed, Rev. i. 3. " Blessed
				   is he that readeth, and they that understand the words of this
				   prophecy." If this be true of that particular book of the Revelation,
				   much more is it true of the Bible in general. Nor is it to be believed
				   that God would have given instructions in such abundance, if he had
				   intended that receiving instruction should be only a bye concern with
				   us.
				
				   It is to be considered, that all those abundant instructions which are
				   contained in the Scriptures were written that they might be understood:
				   otherwise they are not instructions. That which is not given that the
				   learner may understand it, is not given for the learner's instruction;
				   unless we endeavour to grow in the knowledge of divinity, a very great
				   part of those instructions will to us be in vain; for we can receive
				   benefit by no more of the Scriptures than we understand. We have reason
				   to bless God that he hath given us such various and plentiful
				   instruction in his word; but we shall be hypocritical in so doing, if
				   we after all content ourselves with but little of this instruction.
				
				   When God hath opened a very large treasure before us, for the supply of
				   our wants, and we thank him that he hath given us so much; if at the
				   same time we be willing to remain destitute of the greatest pare of it,
				   because we are too lazy to gather it, this will not show the sincerity
				   of our thankfulness. We are now under much greater advantages to
				   acquire knowledge in divinity, than the people of God were of old,
				   because since that time the canon of Scripture is much increased. But
				   if we be negligent of our advantages, we may be never the better for
				   them, and may remain with as little knowledge as they.
				
				   6. However diligent we apply ourselves, there is room enough to
				   increase our knowledge in divine truth. None have this excuse to make
				   for not diligently applying themselves to gain knowledge in divinity,
				   that they already know all; nor can they make this excuse, that they
				   have no need diligently to apply themselves, in order to know all that
				   is to be known. None can excuse themselves for want of business in
				   which to employ themselves. There is room enough to employ ourselves
				   for ever in this divine science, with the utmost application. Those who
				   have applied themselves most closely, have studied the longest, and
				   have made the greatest attainments in this knowledge, know but little
				   of what is to be known. The subject is inexhaustible. That divine
				   Being, who is the main subject of this science, is infinite, and there
				   is no end to the glory of his perfections. His works at the same time
				   are wonderful, and cannot be found out to perfection; especially the
				   work of redemption, about which the science of divinity is chiefly
				   conversant, is full of unsearchable wonders.
				
				   The word of God, which is given for our instruction in divinity,
				   contains enough in it to employ us to the end of our lives, and then we
				   shall leave enough uninvestigated to employ the heads of the ablest
				   divines to the end of the world. The psalmist found an end to the
				   things that are human; but he could never find an end to what is
				   contained in the word of God: Psal. cxix. 96. " I have seen an end to
				   all perfection; but thy command is exceeding broad." There is enough in
				   this divine science to employ the understandings of saints and angels
				   to all eternity.
				
				   7. It doubtless concerns every one to endeavour to excel in the
				   knowledge of things which pertain to his profession, or principal
				   calling. If it concerns men to excel in any thing, or in any wisdom or
				   knowledge at all, it certainly concerns them to excel in the affairs of
				   their main profession and work. But the calling and work of every
				   Christian is to live to God. This is said to be his high calling, Phil.
				   iii. 14. This is the business, and, if I may so speak, the trade of a
				   Christian, his main work, and indeed should be his only work. No
				   business should be done by a Christian, but as it is some way or other
				   a part of this. Therefore certainly the Christian should endeavour to
				   be well acquainted with those things which belong to this work, that he
				   may fulfill it, and be thoroughly furnished to it.
				
				   It becomes one who is called to be a soldier, to excel in the art of
				   war. It becomes a mariner, to excel in the art of navigation. It
				   becomes a physician, to excel in the knowledge of those things which
				   pertain to the art of physic. So it becomes all such as profess to be
				   Christians, and to devote themselves to the practice of Christianity,
				   to endeavour to excel in the knowledge of divinity.
				
				   8. It may be argued hence, that God hath appointed an order of men for
				   this end, to assist persons in gaining knowledge in these things. He
				   hath appointed them to be teachers, 1 Cor. xii. 28. and God hath set
				   some in the church; first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly
				   teachers: Eph. iv. 11, 12. He gave some apostles, some prophets, some
				   evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the
				   saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
				   Christ." If God hath set them to be teachers, making that their
				   business, then he hath made it their business to impart knowledge. But
				   what kind of knowledge? not the knowledge of philosophy, or of human
				   laws, or of mechanical arts, but of divinity.
				
				   If God have made it the business of some to be teachers, it will
				   follow, that he hath made it the business of others to be learners; for
				   teachers and learners are correlates, one of which was never intended
				   to be without the other. God hath never made it the duty of some to
				   take pains to teach those who are not obliged to take pains to learn.
				   He hath not commanded ministers to spend themselves, in order to impart
				   knowledge to those who are not obliged to apply themselves to receive
				   it.
				
				   The name by which Christians are commonly called in the New Testament
				   is disciples, the signification of which word is scholars or learners.
				   All Christians are put into the school of Christ, where their business
				   is to learn, or receive knowledge from Christ, their common master and
				   teacher, and from those inferior teachers appointed by him to instruct
				   in his name.
				
				   9. God hath in the Scriptures plainly revealed it to be his will, that
				   all Christians should diligently endeavour to excel in the knowledge of
				   divine things. It is the revealed will of God, that Christians should
				   not only have some knowledge of things of this nature, but that they
				   should be enriched with all knowledge: 1 Cor. i. 4, 5. " I thank my God
				   always on your behalf, for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus
				   Christ, that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
				   and in all knowledge." So the apostle earnestly prayed, that the
				   Christian Philippians might abound more and more, not only in love, but
				   in Christian knowledge; Phil. i. 9. " And this I pray, that your love
				   may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment." So the
				   apostle Peter advises to " give all diligence to add to faith virtue,
				   and to virtue knowledge," 2 Pet. i. 5, and the apostle Paul, in the
				   next chapter to that wherein is the text, counsels the christian
				   Hebrews, leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, to go
				   on to perfection. He would by no means have them always to rest only in
				   those fundamental doctrines of repentance, and faith, and the
				   resurrection from the dead, and the eternal judgment, in which they
				   were instructed when baptized, at their first initiation in
				   Christianity. (See Heb. vi., etc.)
				
				   SECT. V
				   An exhortation that all may diligently endeavour to gain Christian
				   knowledge
				
				   CONSIDER yourselves as scholars or disciples, put into the school of
				   Christ; and therefore be diligent to make proficiency in christian
				   knowledge. Content not yourselves with this, that you have been taught
				   your catechism in your childhood, and that you know as much of the
				   principles of religion as is necessary to salvation; else you will be
				   guilty of what the apostle warns against, viz. going no further than
				   laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, etc.
				
				   You are all called to be Christians, and this is your profession.
				   Endeavour, therefore, to acquire knowledge in things which pertain to
				   your profession. Let not your teachers have cause to complain, that
				   while they spend and are spent, to impart knowledge to you, you take
				   little pains to learn. It is a great encouragement to an instructor, to
				   have such to teach as make a business of learning, bending their minds
				   to it. This makes teaching a pleasure, when otherwise it will be a very
				   heavy and burdensome task.
				
				   You all have by you a large treasure of divine knowledge, in that you
				   have the Bible in your hands; therefore be not contented in possessing
				   but little of this treasure. God hath spoken much to you in the
				   Scriptures; labour to understand as much of what he saith as you can.
				   God hath made you all reasonable creatures; therefore let not the noble
				   faculty of reason or understanding lie neglected. Content not
				   yourselves with having so much knowledge as is thrown in your way, and
				   receive in some sense unavoidably by the frequent inculcation of divine
				   truth in the preaching of the word, of which you are obliged to be
				   hearers, or accidentally gain in conversation; but let it be very much
				   your business to search for it, and that with the same diligence and
				   labour with which men are wont to dig in mines of silver and gold.
				
				   Especially I would advise those who are young to employ themselves in
				   this way. Men are never too old to learn; but the time of youth is
				   especially the time for learning; it is peculiarly proper for gaining
				   and storing up knowledge.--Further, to stir up all, both old and young,
				   to this duty, let me entreat you to consider,
				
				   1. If you apply yourselves diligently to this work, you will not want
				   employment, when you are at leisure from your common secular business.
				   In this way, you may find something in which you may profitably employ
				   yourselves. You will find something else to do, besides going about
				   from house to house, spending one hour after another in unprofitable
				   conversation, or, at best, to no other purpose but to amuse yourselves,
				   to fill up and wear away your time. And it is to be feared that very
				   much of the time spent in evening visits, is spent to a much worse
				   purpose than that which I have now mentioned. Solomon tells us, Prov.
				   x. 19. "That in the multitude of words, there wanteth not sin." And is
				   not this verified in those who find little else to do but to go to one
				   another's houses, and spend the time in such talk as comes next, or
				   such as any one's present disposition happens to suggest?
				
				   Some diversion is doubtless lawful; but for Christians to spend so much
				   of their time, so many long evenings, in no other conversation than
				   that which tends to divert and amuse, if nothing worse, is a sinful way
				   of spending time, and tends to poverty of soul at least, if not to
				   outward poverty: Prov. xiv. 23. " In all labour there is profit; but
				   the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury." Besides, when persons for
				   so much of their time have nothing else to do, but to sit, and talk,
				   and chat, there is great danger of falling into foolish and sinful
				   conversation, venting their corrupt dispositions, in talking against
				   others, expressing their jealousies and evil surmises concerning their
				   neighbours; not considering what Christ hath said, Matt. xii. 36, " Of
				   every idle word that men shall speak, shall they give account in the
				   day of judgment."
				
				   If you would comply with what you have heard from this doctrine, you
				   would find something else to employ your time besides contention, or
				   talking about those public affairs which tend to contention. Young
				   people might find something else to do, besides spending their time in
				   vain company; something that would be much more profitable to
				   themselves, as it would really turn to some good account; something, in
				   doing which they would both be more out of the way of temptation, and
				   be more in the way of duty, and of a divine blessing. And even aged
				   people would have something to employ themselves in, after they are
				   become incapable of bodily labour. Their time, as is now often the
				   case, would not lie heavy upon their hands, as they would with both
				   profit and pleasure be engaged in searching the Scriptures, and in
				   comparing and meditating upon the various truths which they should find
				   there.
				
				   2. This would be a noble way of spending your time.--The Holy Spirit
				   gives the Bereans this epithet, because they diligently employed
				   themselves in this business: Acts xvii. 11. "These were more noble than
				   those of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
				   readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those
				   things were so." Similar to this is very much the employment of heaven.
				   The inhabitants of that world spend much of their time in searching
				   into the great things of divinity, and endeavouring to acquire
				   knowledge in them, as we are told of the angels, 1 Pet. i. 12. " Which
				   things the angels desire to look into." This will be very agreeable to
				   what you hope will be your business to all eternity, as you doubtless
				   hope to join in the same employment with the angels of light. Solomon
				   says, Prov. xxv. 2. " It is the honour of kings to search out a
				   matter;" and certainly, above all others, to search out divine matters.
				   Now, if this be the honour even of kings, is it not much more your
				   honour?
				
				   3. This is a pleasant way of improving time. Knowledge is pleasant and
				   delightful to intelligent creatures, and above all, the knowledge of
				   divine things; for in them are the most excellent truths, and the most
				   beautiful and amiable objects held forth to view. However tedious the
				   labour necessarily attending this business may be, yet the knowledge
				   once obtained will richly requite the pains taken to obtain it. " When
				   wisdom entereth the heart, knowledge is pleasant to the soul." Prov.
				   ii. 10.
				
				   4. This knowledge is exceedingly useful in Christian practice. Such as
				   have much knowledge in divinity have great means and advantages for
				   spiritual and saving knowledge; for no means of grace have a saving
				   effect, otherwise than by the knowledge they impart. The more you have
				   of a rational knowledge of divine things, the more opportunity will
				   there be, when the Spirit shall be breathed into your heart, to see the
				   excellency of these things, and to taste the sweetness of them. The
				   heathens, who have no rational knowledge of the things of the gospel,
				   have no opportunity to see the excellency of them; and therefore the
				   more rational knowledge of these things you have, the more opportunity
				   and advantage you have to see the divine excellency and glory of them.
				
				   Again, The more knowledge you have of divine things, the better will
				   you know your duty; your knowledge will be of great use to direct you
				   as to your duty in particular cases. You will also be the better
				   furnished against the temptations of the devil. For the devil often
				   takes advantage of persons' ignorance to ply them with temptations
				   which otherwise would have no hold of them. By having much knowledge,
				   you will be under greater advantages to conduct yourselves with
				   prudence and discretion in your Christian course, and so to live much
				   more to the honour of God and religion. Many who mean well, and are
				   full of a good spirit, yet for want of prudence, conduct themselves so
				   as to wound religion. Many have a zeal of God, which cloth more hurt
				   than good, because it is not according to knowledge, Rom. X. 2. The
				   reason why many good men behave no better in many instances, is not so
				   much that they want grace, as that they want knowledge. Beside, an
				   increase of knowledge would be a great help to profitable conversation.
				   It would supply you with matter for conversation when you come
				   together, or when you visit your neighbours: and so you would have less
				   temptation to spend the time in such conversation as tends to your own
				   and others' hurt.
				
				   5. Consider the advantages you are under to grow in the knowledge of
				   divinity. We are under far greater advantages to gain much of this
				   knowledge now, than God's people under the Old Testament, both because
				   the canon of Scripture is so much enlarged since that time, and also
				   because evangelical truths are now so much more plainly revealed. So
				   that common men are now in some respects under advantages to know more,
				   than the greatest prophets were then. Thus that saying of Christ is in
				   a sense applicable to us, Luke x. 23, 24. " Blessed are the eyes which
				   see the things which ye see. For I tell you, that many prophets and
				   kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen
				   them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
				   We are in some respects under far greater advantages for gaining
				   knowledge, now in these latter ages of the church, than Christians were
				   formerly; especially by reason of the art of printing, of which God
				   hath given us the benefit, whereby Bibles and other books of divinity
				   are exceedingly multiplied, and persons may now be furnished with helps
				   for the obtaining of Christian knowledge, at a much easier and cheaper
				   rate than they formerly could.
				
				   6. We know not what opposition we may meet with in the religious
				   principles which we hold. We know that there are many adversaries to
				   the gospel and its truths. If therefore we embrace those truths, we
				   must expect to be attacked by the said adversaries; and unless we be
				   well informed concerning divine things, how shall we be able to defend
				   ourselves? Beside, the apostle Paul enjoins it upon us, always to be
				   ready to give an answer to every man who asketh us a reason of the hope
				   that is in us. But this we cannot expect to do without considerable
				   knowledge in divine things.
				
				   SECT. VI
				   Directions for the acquisition of Christian knowledge
				
				   1. BE assiduous in reading the Holy Scriptures. This is the fountain
				   whence all knowledge in divinity must be derived.
				
				   Therefore let not this treasure lie by you neglected. Every man of
				   common understanding who can read, may, if he please, become well
				   acquainted with the Scriptures. And what an excellent attainment would
				   this be!
				
				   2. Content not yourselves with only a cursory reading, without
				   regarding the sense. This is an ill way of reading, to which, however,
				   many accustom themselves all their days. When you read, observe what
				   you read. Observe how things come in. Take notice of the drift of the
				   discourse, and compare one scripture with another. For the Scripture,
				   by the harmony of its different; parts, casts great light upon
				   itself.--We are expressly directed by Christ, to search the Scriptures,
				   which evidently intends something more than a mere cursory reading. And
				   use means to find out the meaning of the Scripture. When you have it
				   explained in the preaching of the word, take notice of it; and if at
				   any time a scripture that you did not understand be cleared up to your
				   satisfaction, mark it, lay it up, and if possible remember it.
				
				   3. Procure, and diligently use, other books which may help you to grow
				   in this knowledge. There are many excellent books extant, which might
				   greatly forward you in this knowledge, and afford you a very profitable
				   and pleasant entertainment in your leisure hours. There is doubtless a
				   great defect in many, that through a lothness to be at a little
				   expense, they furnish themselves with no more helps of this nature.
				   They have a few books indeed, which now and then on sabbath-days they
				   read; but they have had them so long, and read them so often, that they
				   are weary of them, and it is now become a dull story, a mere task to
				   read them.
				
				   4. Improve conversation with others to this end. How much might persons
				   promote each other's knowledge in divine things, if they would improve
				   conversation as they might; if men that are ignorant were not ashamed
				   to show their ignorance, and were willing to learn of others; if those
				   that have knowledge would communicate it, without pride and
				   ostentation; and if all were more disposed to enter on such
				   conversation as would be for their mutual edification and instruction.
				
				   5. Seek not to grow in knowledge chiefly for the sake of applause, and
				   to enable you to dispute with others; but seek it for the benefit of
				   your souls, and in order to practice.--If applause be your end, you
				   will not be so likely to be led to the knowledge of the truth, but may
				   justly, as often is the case of those who are proud of their knowledge,
				   be led into error to your own perdition. This being your end, if you
				   should obtain much rational knowledge, it would not be likely to be of
				   any benefit to you, but would puff you up with pride: 1 Cor. viii. 1. "
				   Knowledge puffeth up."
				
				   6. Seek to God, that he would direct you, and bless you, in this
				   pursuit after knowledge. This is the apostle's direction, James i. 5. "
				   If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all
				   liberally, and upbraideth not." God is the fountain of all divine
				   knowledge: Prov. ii. 6. "The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth
				   cometh knowledge and understanding." Labour to be sensible of your own
				   blindness and ignorance, and your need of the help of God, lest you be
				   led into error, instead of true knowledge: 1 Cor. iii. 18. " If any man
				   would be wise, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
				
				   7. Practice according to what knowledge you have. This will be the way
				   to know more. The psalmist warmly recommends this way of seeking
				   knowledge in divine truth, from his own experience: Psal. cxix. 100. "
				   I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts."
				   Christ also recommends the same: John vii. 17. "If any man will do his
				   will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I
				   speak of myself."
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				The Manner in Which the Salvation of the Soul is to be Sought
				
				    Genesis 6:22 -- Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so
				    did he.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   Concerning these words, I would observe three things:
				
				   1. What it was that God commanded Noah, to which these words refer. It
				   was the building of an ark according to the particular direction of
				   God, against the time when the flood of waters should come; and the
				   laying up of food for himself, his family, and the other animals, which
				   were to be preserved in the ark. We have the particular commands which
				   God gave him respecting this affair, from the 14th verse, "Make thee an
				   ark of gopher wood," &c
				
				   2. We may observe the special design of the work which God had enjoined
				   upon Noah: it was to save himself and his family, when the rest of the
				   world should be drowned. See ver. 17, 18. We may observe Noah's
				   obedience. He obeyed God: thus did Noah. And his obedience was thorough
				   and universal: according to all that God commanded him, so did he. He
				   not only began, but he went through his work, which God had commanded
				   him to undertake for his salvation from the flood. To this obedience
				   the apostle refers in Heb. 11:7, "By faith Noah, being warned of God of
				   things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving
				   of his house.
				
				  DOCTRINE.
				
				   We should be willing to engage in and go through great undertakings, in
				   order to our own salvation.
				
				   The building of the ark, which was enjoined upon Noah, that he and his
				   family might be saved, was a great undertaking: the ark was a building
				   of vast size; the length of it being three hundred cubits, the breadth
				   of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A cubit, till
				   of late, was by learned men reckoned to be equal to a foot and a half
				   of our measure. But lately some learned men of our nation have
				   travelled into Egypt, and other ancient countries, and have measured
				   some ancient buildings there, which are of several thousand years
				   standing, and of which ancient histories give us the dimensions in
				   cubits; particularly the pyramids of Egypt, which are standing entire
				   at this day. By measuring these, and by comparing the measure in feet
				   with the ancient accounts of their measure in cubits, a cubit is found
				   to be almost two and twenty inches. Therefore learned men more lately
				   reckon a cubit much larger than they did formerly. So that the ark,
				   reckoned so much larger every way, will appear to be almost of double
				   the bulk which was formerly ascribed to it According to this
				   computation of the cubit, it was more than five hundred and fifty feet
				   long, about ninety feet broad, and about fifty feet in height.
				
				   To build such a structure, with all those apartments and divisions in
				   it which were necessary, and in such a manner as to be fit to float
				   upon the water for so long a time, was then a great undertaking. It
				   took Noah, with all the workmen he employed, a hundred and twenty
				   years, or thereabouts, to build it For so long it was, that the Spirit
				   of God strove, and the long-suffering God waited on the old world, as
				   you may see in Gen. 4:3: "My Spirit shall I not always strive with man;
				   yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years." All this while the
				   ark was a preparing, as appears by 1 Pet. 3:20: "When once the
				   long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
				   preparing." It was a long time that Noah constantly employed himself in
				   this business. Men would esteem that undertaking very great, which
				   should keep them constantly employed even for one half of that time.
				   Noah must have had a great and constant care upon his mind for these
				   one hundred and twenty years, in superintending this work, and in
				   seeing that all was done exactly according to the directions which God
				   had given him.
				
				   Not only was Noah himself continually employed, but it required a great
				   number of workmen to be constantly employed, during all that time, in
				   procuring, and collecting, and fitting the materials, and in putting
				   them together in due form. How great a thing was it for Noah to
				   undertake such a work! For beside the continual care and labor, it was
				   a work of vast expense. It is not probable that any of that wicked
				   generation would put to a finger to help forward such a work, which
				   doubtless they believed was merely the fruit of Noah's folly, without
				   full wages. Noah must needs have been very rich, to be able to bear the
				   expense of such a work, and to pay so many workmen for so long a time.
				   It would have been a very great expense for a prince; and doubtless
				   Noah was very rich, as Abraham and Job were afterwards. But it is
				   probable that Noah spent all his worldly substance in this work, thus
				   manifesting his faith in the word of God, by selling all he had, as
				   believing there would surely come a flood, which would destroy all; so
				   that if he should keep what he had, it would be of no service to him.
				   Herein he has set us an example, showing us how we ought to sell all
				   for our salvation.
				
				   Noah's undertaking was of great difficulty, as it exposed him to the
				   continual reproaches of all his neighbors, for that whole one hundred
				   and twenty years. None of them believed what he told them of a flood
				   which was about to drown the world. For a man to undertake such a vast
				   piece of work, under notion that it should be the means of saving him
				   when the world should be destroyed, it made him the continual
				   laughing-stock of the world. When he was about to hire workmen,
				   doubtless all laughed at him, and we may suppose, that though the
				   workmen consented to work for wages, yet they laughed at the folly of
				   him who employed them. When the ark was begun, we may suppose that
				   every one that passed by and saw such a huge bulk stand there, laughed
				   at, it, calling it Noah's folly.
				
				   In these days, men are with difficulty brought to do or submit to that
				   which makes them the objects of the reproach of all their neighbors.
				   Indeed if while some reproach them, others stand by them and honor
				   them, this will support them. But it is very difficult for a man to go
				   on in a way wherein he makes himself the laughing stock of the whole
				   world, and wherein he can find none who do not despise him. Where is
				   the man that can stand the shock of such a trial for twenty years?
				   But in such an undertaking as this, Noah at the divine direction,
				   engaged and went through it, that himself and his family might be saved
				   from the common destruction which was shortly about to come on the
				   world. He began, and also made an end: "According to all that God
				   commanded him, so did he." Length of time did not weary him: he did not
				   grow weary of his vast expense. He stood the shock of the derision of
				   all his neighbors; and of all the world year after year: he did not
				   grow weary of being their laughing-stock, so as to give over his
				   enterprise; but persevered in it till the ark was finished. After this,
				   he was at the trouble and charge of procuring stores for the
				   maintenance of his family, and of all the various kinds of creatures,
				   for so long a time. Such an undertaking he engaged in and went through
				   in order to a temporal salvation. How great an undertaking then should
				   men be willing to engage in and go through in order to their eternal
				   salvation! A salvation from an eternal deluge; from being overwhelmed
				   with the billows of God's wrath of which Noah's flood was but a shadow.
				
				   I shall particularly handle this doctrine under the three following
				   propositions.
				
				   I. There is a work or business which must be undertaken and
				   accomplished by men, if they would be saved.
				   II. This business is a great undertaking.
				   III. Men should be willing to enter upon and go through this
				   undertaking though it be great, seeing it is for their own salvation.
				   Proposition. There is a work or business which men must enter upon and
				   accomplish, in order to their salvation.-Men have no reason to expect
				   to be saved in idleness, or to go to heaven in a way of doing nothing.
				   No; in order to it, there is a great work, which must be not only
				   begun, but finished-I shall speak upon this proposition, in answer to
				   two inquiries.
				
				   I. What is this work or business which must be undertaken and
				   accomplished in order to the salvation of men?
				   Answer. It is the work of seeking salvation in a way of constant
				   observance of all the duty to which God directs its in his word. If we
				   would be saved, we must seek salvation. For although men do not obtain
				   heaven of themselves; they do not go thither accidentally, or without
				   any intention or endeavors of their own. God, in his word, hath
				   directed men to seek their salvation as they would hope to obtain it.
				   There is a race that is set before them, which they must run, and in
				   that race come off victors, in order to their winning the prize.
				
				   The Scriptures have told us what particular duties must be performed by
				   us in order to our salvation. It is not sufficient that men seek their
				   salvation on in the observance of some of those duties; but they must
				   be observed universally. The work we have to do is not an obedience
				   only to some, but to all the commands of God; a compliance with every
				   institution of worship; a diligent use of all the appointed means of
				   grace; a doing of all duty towards God and towards man.-It is not
				   sufficient that men have some respect to all the commands of God, and
				   that they may be said to seek their salvation in some sort of
				   observance of all the commands; but they must be devoted to it.
				
				   They must not make this a business by the by, or a thing in which they
				   are negligent and careless, or which they do with a slack hand; but it
				   must be their great business, being attended to as their great concern.
				   They must not only seek, but strive; they must do what their hand
				   findeth to do with their might, as men thoroughly engaged in their
				   minds, and influenced and set forward by great desire and strong
				   resolution. They must act as those that see so much of the importance
				   of religion above all other things, that every thing else must be as an
				   occasional affair, and nothing must stand in competition with its
				   duties. This must be the one thing they do; Phil. 3:13, "This one thing
				   I do."-It must be the business to which they make all other affairs
				   give place, and to which they are ready to make other things a
				   sacrifice. They must be ready to part with pleasures and honor, estate
				   and life, and to sell all, that they may successfully accomplish this
				   business.
				
				   It is required of every man, that he not only do something in this
				   business, but that he should devote himself to it; which implies that
				   he should give up himself to it, all his affairs, and all his temporal
				   enjoyments. This is the import of taking up the cross, of taking
				   Christ's yoke upon us, and of denying ourselves to follow Christ. The
				   rich young man, who came kneeling to Christ to know what he should do
				   to he saved, Mark 10:17, in some sense sought salvation but did not
				   obtain it. In some sense he kept all the commands from his youth up;
				   but was not cordially devoted to this business. He had not made a
				   sacrifice to it of all his enjoyments, as appeared when Christ came to
				   try him; he would not part with his estate for him.
				
				   It is not only necessary that men should seem to he very much engaged,
				   and appear as if they were devoted to their duty for a little while;
				   but there must be a constant devotedness, in a persevering way, as Noah
				   was to the business of the building the ark, going on with that great,
				   difficult, and expensive affair, till it was finished, and till the
				   flood came. Men must not only be diligent in the use of the means of
				   grace, and be anxiously engaged to escape eternal ruin, till they
				   obtain hope and comfort; but afterwards they must persevere in the
				   duties of religion, till the flood come, the flood of death. Not only
				   must the faculties, strength, and possessions of men be devoted to this
				   work, but also their time and their lives; they must give up their
				   whole lives to it, even to the very day when God causes the storms and
				   floods to come. This is the work or business which men have to do in
				   order to their salvation.
				
				   Inquiry 2. Why is it needful that men should undertake to go through
				   such a work in order to their salvation?
				
				   Answer 1. Not to merit salvation, or to recommend them to the saving
				   mercy of God. Men are not saved on the account of any work of theirs,
				   and yet they are not saved without works. If we merely consider what it
				   is for which, or on the account of which, men are saved, no work at all
				   in men is necessary to their salvation. In this respect they are saved
				   wholly without any work of theirs: Tit. iii. 5, "Not by works of
				   righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
				   us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost." We
				   must indeed be saved on the account of works; but not our own. It is on
				   account of the works which Christ hath done for us. Works are the fixed
				   price of eternal life; it is fixed by an eternal, unalterable rule of
				   righteousness. But since the fall there is no hope of our doing these
				   works, without salvation offered freely without money and without
				   price. But,
				
				   2. Though it be not needful that we do any thing to merit salvation,
				   which Christ hath fully merited for all who believe in him; yet God,
				   for wise and holy ends, hath appointed, that we should come to final
				   salvation in no other way, but that of good works done by us. God did
				   not save Noah on account of the labor and expense he was at in building
				   the ark. Noah's salvation from the flood was an instance of the free
				   and distinguishing mercy of God. Nor did God stand in need of Noah's
				   care, or cost, or labor, to build an ark. The same power which created
				   the world, and which brought the flood of waters upon the earth, could
				   have made the ark in an instant, without any care or cost to Noah, or
				   any of the labor of those workmen who were employed for so long a time.
				   Yet God was pleased to appoint, that Noah should be saved in this way.
				   So God hath appointed that man should not be saved without his
				   undertaking and doing this work of which I have been speaking; and
				   therefore we are commanded "to work out our own salvation with fear and
				   trembling," Philip. 2:12.
				
				   There are many wise ends to be answered by the establishment of such a
				   work as prerequisite to salvation. The glory of God requires it. For
				   although God stand in no need of any thing that men do to recommend
				   them to his saving mercy, yet it would reflect much on the glory of
				   God's wisdom and holiness, to bestow salvation on men in such a way as
				   tends to encourage them in sloth and wickedness; or in any other way
				   than that which tends to promote diligence and holiness. Man was made
				   capable of action, with many powers of both body and mind fitting him
				   for it. He was made for business and not idleness and the main business
				   for which he was made, was that of religion. Therefore it becomes the
				   wisdom of God to bestow salvation and happiness on man in such a way as
				   tends most to promote his end in this respect, and, to stir him up to a
				   diligent use of his faculties and talents.
				
				   It becomes the wisdom of God so to order it, that things of great value
				   and importance should not be obtained without great labor and
				   diligence. Much human learning and great moral accomplishments are not
				   to be obtained without care and labor. It is wisely so ordered, in
				   order to maintain in man a due sense of the value of those things which
				   are excellent. If great things were in common easily obtained, it would
				   have a tendency to cause men to slight and undervalue them. Men
				   commonly despise those things which are cheap, and which are obtained
				   without difficulty.
				
				   Although the work of obedience performed by men, be not necessary in
				   order to merit salvation; yet it is necessary in order to their being
				   prepared for it. Men cannot be prepared for salvation without seeking
				   it in such a way as hath been described. This is necessary in order
				   that they have a proper sense of their own necessities, and
				   unworthiness; and in order that they be prepared and disposed to prize
				   salvation when bestowed, and be properly thankful to God for it. The
				   requisition of so great a work in order to our salvation is no way
				   inconsistent with the freedom of the offer of salvation; as after all
				   it is both offered and bestowed without any respect to our work, as the
				   price or meritorious cause of our salvation, as I have already
				   explained. Besides, salvation bestowed in this way is better for us,
				   more for our advantage and happiness both in this and the future world,
				   than if it were given without this requisition.
				
				   II. Proposition. This work or business, which must be done in order to
				   the salvation of men, is a great undertaking. It often appears so to
				   men upon whom it is urged. Utterly to break off from all their sins,
				   and to give up themselves forever to the business of religion, without
				   making a reserve of any one lust, submitting to and complying with
				   every command of God, in all cases, and persevering therein, appears to
				   many so great a thing, that they are in vain urged to undertake it. In
				   so doing it seems to them, that they should give up themselves to a
				   perpetual bondage. The greater part of men therefore choose to put it
				   off, and keep it at as great a distance as they can. They cannot bear
				   to think of entering immediately on such a hard service, and rather
				   than do it, they will run the risk of eternal damnation, by putting it
				   off to an uncertain future opportunity.
				
				   Although the business of religion is far from really being as it
				   appears to such men, or the devil will be sure, if he can, to represent
				   it in false colors to sinners, and make it appear as black and as
				   terrible as he can; yet it is indeed a great business, a great
				   undertaking, and it is fit that all who are urged to it should count
				   the cost beforehand, and be sensible of the difficulty attending it.
				   For though the devil discourages many from this undertaking, by
				   representing it to be more difficult than it really is; yet with others
				   he takes a contrary course and flatters them it is a very easy thing, a
				   trivial business, which may be done at any time when they please, and
				   so emboldens them to defer it from that consideration. But let none
				   conceive any other notion of that business of religion, which is
				   absolutely necessary to their salvation, than that it is a great
				   undertaking. It is so on the following accounts.
				
				   1. It is a business of great labor and care. There are many commands to
				   be obeyed, many duties to be done, duties to God, duties to our
				   neighbor, and duties, to ourselves. There is much opposition in the way
				   of these duties from without. There is a subtle and powerful adversary
				   laying all manner of blocks in the way. There are innumerable
				   temptations of Satan to be resisted and repelled. There is great
				   opposition from the world, innumerable snares laid, on every side, many
				   rocks and mountains to be passed over, many streams to be passed
				   through, and many flatteries and enticements from a vain world to be
				   resisted. There is a great opposition from within; a dull and sluggish
				   heart, which is exceedingly averse from that activity in religion which
				   is necessary; a carnal heart, which is averse from religion and
				   spiritual exercises, and continually drawing the contrary way; and a
				   proud and a deceitful heart, in which corruption will be exerting
				   itself in all manner of ways. So that nothing can be done to any effect
				   without a most strict and careful watch, great labor and strife.
				
				   2. It is a constant in business.-In that business which requires great
				   labor, men love now and then to have a space of relaxation, that they
				   may rest from their extraordinary labor. But this is a business which
				   must be followed every day. Luke ix. 23, " If any man will come after
				   me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow me."
				   We must never give ourselves any relaxation from this business; it must
				   be continually prosecuted day after day. If sometimes we make a great
				   stir and bustle concerning religion, but then lay all aside to take our
				   ease, and do so from time to time, it will be of no good effect; we had
				   even as good do nothing at all. The business of religion so followed is
				   never like to come to any good issue, nor is the work ever like to be
				   accomplished to any good purpose.
				
				   3. It is a great undertaking, as it is an undertaking of great
				   expense.-We must, therein sell all: we must follow this business at the
				   expense of all our unlawful pleasures and delights, at the expense of
				   our carnal ease, often at the expense of our substance, of our credit
				   among men, the good will of our neighbors, at the expense of all our
				   earthly friends, and even at the expense of life itself. Herein it is
				   like Noah's undertaking to build the ark, which, as hath been shown was
				   a costly undertaking: it was expensive to his reputation among men,
				   exposing him to be the continual laughing-stock of all his neighbors
				   and of the whole world: and it was expensive to his estate, and
				   probably cost him all that he had.
				
				   4. Sometimes the fear, trouble, and exercise of mind, which are
				   undergone respecting this business, and the salvation of the soul, are
				   great and long continued, before any comfort is obtained. Sometimes
				   persons in this situation labor long in the dark, and sometimes, as it
				   were, in the very fire, they having great distress of conscience, great
				   fears, and many perplexing temptations, before they obtain light and
				   comfort to make their care and labor more easy to them. They sometimes
				   earnestly, and for a long time, seek comfort, but find it not, because
				   they seek it not in a right manner, nor in the right objects. God
				   therefore hides his face. They cry, but God doth not answer their
				   prayers. They strive, but all seems in vain. They seem to themselves
				   not at all to get forward, or nearer to a deliverance from sin: but to
				   go backward, rather than forward. They see no glimmerings of light:
				   things rather appear darker and darker. Insomuch that they are often
				   ready to be discouraged, and to sink under the weight of their present
				   distress, and under the prospect of future misery. In this situation,
				   and under these views, some are almost driven to despair. Many, after
				   they have obtained some saving comfort, are again involved in darkness
				   and trouble. It is with them as it was with the Christian Hebrews, Heb.
				   10:32, "After ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of
				   afflictions. Some through a melancholy habit and distemper of body,
				   together with Satan's temptations, spend a great part of their lives in
				   distress and darkness, even after they have had some saving comfort.
				
				   5. It is a business which, by reason of the many difficulties, snares,
				   and dangers that attend it, requires much instruction, consideration,
				   and counsel. There is no business wherein men stand in need of counsel
				   more than in this. It is a difficult undertaking, a hard matter to
				   proceed aright in it. There are ten thousand wrong ways, which men may
				   take; there are many labyrinths wherein many poor souls are entangled
				   and never find the way out ; there are many rocks on which thousands of
				   souls have suffered shipwreck, for want of, having steered aright.
				
				   Men of themselves know not how to proceed in this business, any more
				   than the children of Israel in the wilderness knew where to go without
				   the guidance, of the pillar of cloud and fire. There is great need that
				   they search the Scriptures, and give diligent heed to the instructions
				   and directions contained in them, as to a light shining in a dark place
				   and that they ask counsel of those skilled in these matters. And there
				   is no business in which men have so much need of seeking to God by
				   prayer, for his counsel, and that he would lead them in the right way,
				   and show them the strait gate. " For strait is the gate and narrow is
				   the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it;" yea,
				   there are none that find it without direction from heaven. The building
				   of the ark was a work of great difficulty on this account, that Noah's
				   wisdom was not sufficient to direct him how to make such a building as
				   should be a sufficient security against such a flood, and which should
				   be a convenient dwelling-place for himself, his family, and all the
				   various kinds of beasts and birds, and creeping things. Nor could he
				   ever have known how to construct this building, had not God directed
				   him.
				
				   6. This business never ends till life ends. They that undertake this
				   laborious, careful, expensive, self-denying business, must not expect
				   to rest from their labors, till death shall have put an end to them.
				   The long continuance of the work which Noah undertook was what
				   especially made it a great undertaking. This also was what made the
				   travel of the children of Israel through the wilderness appear so great
				   to them, that it was continued for so long a time. Their spirits
				   failed, they were discouraged, and had not a heart to go through with
				   so great an undertaking. But such is this business that it runs
				   parallel with life, whether it be longer or shorter. Although we should
				   live to a great age, our race and warfare will not be finished till
				   death shall come. We must not expect that an end will be put to our
				   labor, and care, and strife, by any hope of a good estate which we may
				   obtain. Past attainments and past success will not excuse us from what
				   remains for the future, nor will they make future constant labor and
				   care unnecessary to our salvation.
				
				   III. Men should be willing to engage in and go through this business,
				   however great and difficult it may seem to them, seeing it is for their
				   own salvation. Because,
				
				   1. A deluge of wrath will surely come. The inhabitants of the old world
				   would not believe that there would come such a flood of waters upon the
				   earth as that of which Noah told them, though he told them often;
				   neither would they take any care to avoid the destruction. Yet such a
				   deluge did come; nothing of all those things of which Noah had
				   forewarned them, failed.
				   So there will surely come a more dreadful deluge of divine wrath on
				   this wicked world. We are often forewarned of it in the Scriptures, and
				   the world, as then, doth not believe any such thing. Yet the
				   threatening will as certainly be accomplished, as the threatening
				   denounced against the old world. A day of wrath is coming; it will come
				   at its appointed season; it will not tarry, it
				   shall not be delayed one moment beyond its appointed time.
				
				   2. All such as do not seasonably undertake and go through the great
				   work mentioned will surely be swallowed up in this deluge. When the
				   floods of wrath shall come, they will universally overwhelm the wicked
				   world: all such as shall not have taken care to prepare an ark, will
				   surely be swallowed up in it; they will find no other way of escape. In
				   vain shall salvation be expected from the hills, and from the multitude
				   of mountains; for the flood shall be above the tops of all the
				   mountains. Or if they shall hide themselves in the caves and dens of
				   the mountains, there the waters of the flood will find them out, and
				   there shall they miserably perish. As those of the old world who were
				   not in the ark perished, Gen. 7:21, 23, so all who shall not have
				   secured to themselves a place in the spiritual ark of the gospel, shall
				   perish much more miserably than the old world. Doubtless the
				   inhabitants of the old world had many contrivances to save themselves.
				   Some, we may suppose, ascended to the tops of their houses, being
				   driven out of one story to another, till at last they perished. Others
				   climbed to the tops of high towers; who yet were washed thence by the
				   boisterous waves of the rising flood. Some climbed to the tops of
				   trees; others to the tops of mountains, and especially of the highest
				   mountains. But all was in vain; the flood sooner or later swallowed
				   them all up; only Noah and his family, who had taken care to prepare an
				   ark, remained alive. So it will doubtless be at the end of the world,
				   when Christ shall dome to judge the world in righteousness. Some, when
				   they shall look up and see him coming in the clouds of heaven, shall
				   hide themselves in closets, and secret places in their houses. Others
				   flying to the caves and dens of the earth, shall attempt to hide
				   themselves there. Others shall call upon the rocks and mountains to
				   fall on them, and cover them from the face of him that sitteth on the
				   throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.-So it will be after the
				   sentence is pronounced, and wicked men see that terrible fire coming,
				   which is to burn this world forever, and which will be a deluge of
				   fire, and will burn the earth even to the bottoms of the mountains, and
				   to its very centre. Deut. 32:22, "For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
				   and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her
				   increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains." I say,
				   when the wicked shall, after the sentence, see this great fire
				   beginning to kindle, and to take hold of this earth; there will be many
				   contrivances devised by them to escape, some flying to caves and holes
				   in the earth, some hiding themselves in one place, and some in another.
				   But let them hide themselves where they will, or let them do what they
				   will, it will be utterly in vain. Every cave shall burn as an oven, the
				   rocks and mountains shall melt with fervent heat, and if they could
				   creep down to the very centre of the earth, still the heat would follow
				   them, and rage with as much vehemence there, as on the very surface.
				
				   So when wicked men, who neglect their great work in their lifetime, who
				   are not willing to go through the difficulty and labor of this work,
				   draw near to death, they sometimes do many things to escape death, and
				   put forth many endeavors to lengthen out their lives at least a little
				   longer. For this end, they send for physicians, and perhaps many are
				   consulted, and their prescriptions are punctually observed. They also
				   use many endeavors to save their souls from hell. They cry to God;.
				   they confess their past sins; they promise future reformation; and, Oh
				   what would they not give for some small addition to their lives, or
				   some hope of future happiness! But all proves in vain: God hath
				   numbered their days and finished them; and as they have sinned away the
				   day of grace, they must even bear the consequence, and forever lie down
				   in sorrow.
				
				   3. The destruction, when it shall come, will be infinitely terrible.
				   The destruction of the old world by the flood was terrible; but that
				   eternal destruction which is coming on the wicked is infinitely more
				   so. That flood of waters was but an image of this awful flood of divine
				   vengeance. When the waters poured down, more like spouts or cataracts,
				   or the fall of a great river, than like rain; what an awful appearance
				   was there of the wrath of God! This however but an image of that
				   terrible outpouring of the wrath of God which shall be forever, yea
				   forever and ever, on wicked men. And when the fountains of the great
				   deep were broken up, and the waters burst forth out of the ground
				   though they had issued out of the womb (Job38:8), this was an image of
				   the mighty breakings forth of God's wrath, which shall be, when the
				   flood gates of wrath shall be drawn up. How may we suppose that the
				   wicked of the old world repented that they had not hearkened to the
				   warnings which Noah had given them, when they saw these dreadful
				   things, and saw that they must perish! How much more will you repent
				   your refusing to hearken to the gracious warnings of the gospel, when
				   you shall see the fire of God's wrath against you, pouring down from
				   heaven, and bursting on all sides out of bowels of the earth!
				
				   4. Though the work which is necessary in order to man's salvation be a
				   great work, yet it is not impossible. What was required of Noah,
				   doubtless appeared a very great and difficult undertaking. Yet he
				   undertook it with resolution, and he was carried through it. So if we
				   undertake this work with the same good will and resolution, we shall
				   undoubtedly be successful. However difficult it be, yet multitudes have
				   gone through it, and have obtained salvation by the means. It is not a
				   work beyond the faculties of our nature, nor beyond the opportunities
				   which God giveth us. If men will but take warning, and hearken to
				   counsel, if they will but be sincere and in good earnest, be seasonable
				   in their work, take their opportunities, use their advantages be
				   steadfast, and not wavering; they shall not fail.
				
				  APPLICATION.
				
				   The use I would make of this doctrine, is to exhort all to undertake
				   and go through this great work, which they have to do in order to their
				   salvation, and this let the work seem ever so great and difficult. If
				   your nature be averse to it, and there seems to be very frightful
				   things in the way, so that your heart is ready to fail at the prospect;
				   yet seriously consider what has been said, and act a wise part. Seeing
				   it is for yourselves, for your own salvation; seeing it is for so great
				   a salvation, for your deliverance from eternal destruction; and seeing
				   it is of such absolute necessity in order to your salvation, that the
				   deluge of divine wrath will come, and there will be no escaping it
				   without preparing an ark; is it not best for you to undertake the work,
				   engage in it with your might, and go through it, though this cannot be
				   done without great labor, care, and difficulty, and expense?
				   I would by no means flatter you concerning this work, or go about to
				   make you believe, that you shall find an easy light business of it: no,
				   I would not have you expect any such thing. I would have you sit down
				   and count the cost; and if you cannot find it in your hearts to engage
				   in a great, hard, laborious, and expensive undertaking, and to
				   persevere in it to the end of life, pretend not to be religious.
				   Indulge yourselves in your ease; follow your pleasures; eat, drink, and
				   be merry; even conclude to go to hell in that way, and never make any
				   more pretenses of seeking your salvation. Here consider several things
				   in particular.
				   1. How often you have been warned of the approaching flood of God's
				   wrath. How frequently you have been told of hell, heard the
				   threatenings of the word of God set before you, and been warned to flee
				   from the wrath to come. It is with you as it was with the inhabitants
				   of the old world. Noah warned them abundantly of the approaching flood,
				   and counseled them to take care for their safety, 1 Pet. 3:19, 20. Noah
				   warned them in words; and he preached to them. He warned them also in
				   his actions. His building the ark, which took him so long a time, and
				   in which he employed so many hands, was a standing warning to them. All
				   the blows of the hammer and axe, during the progress of that building,
				   were so many calls and warnings to the old world, to take care for
				   their preservation from the approaching destruction. Every knock of the
				   workmen was a knock of Jesus Christ at the door of their hearts: but
				   they would not hearken. All these warnings, though repeated every day,
				   and continued for so long a time, availed nothing.
				
				   Now, is it not much so with you, as it was with them? How often have
				   you been warned! How have you heard the warning knocks of the gospel,
				   Sabbath after Sabbath, for these many years! Yet how have some of you
				   no more regarded them than the inhabitants of the old world regarded
				   the noise of the workmen's tools in Noah's ark!
				
				   Objection. But here possibly it may be objected by some, that though it
				   be true they have often been told of hell, yet they never saw any thing
				   of it, and therefore they cannot realize it that there is any such
				   place. They have often heard of hell, and are told that wicked men,
				   when they die, go to a most dreadful place of torment; that hereafter
				   there will be a day of judgment, and that the world will be consumed by
				   fire. But how do they know that it is really so? How do they know what
				   becomes of those wicked men that die? None of them come back to tell
				   them. They have nothing to depend on but the word which they hear. And
				   how do they know that all is not a cunningly-devised fable?
				
				   Answer. The sinners of the old world had the very same objection
				   against what Noah told them of a flood about to drown the world. Yet
				   the bare word of God proved to be sufficient evidence that such a thing
				   was coming. What was the reason that none of the many millions then
				   upon earth believed what Noah said, but this, that it was a strange
				   thing, that no such thing had ever before been known? And what a
				   strange story must that of Noah have appeared to them, wherein he told
				   them of a deluge of waters above the tops of the mountains! Therefore
				   it. is said, Heb. 11:7, that "Noah was warned of God of things not seen
				   as yet." It is probable, none could conceive how it could be that the
				   whole world should be drowned in a flood of waters; and all were ready
				   to ask, where there was water enough for it; and by what means it
				   should be brought upon the earth. Noah did not tell them how it should
				   be brought to pass; he only told them that God had said that it should
				   be: and that proved to be enough. The event showed their folly in not
				   depending on the mere word of God, who was able, who knew how to bring
				   it to pass, and who could not lie.
				
				   In like manner the word of God will prove true, in threatening a flood
				   of eternal wrath to overwhelm all the wicked. You will believe it when
				   the event shall prove it, when it shall be too late to profit by the
				   belief. The word of God will never fail; nothing is so sure as that:
				   heaven and earth shall pass away, but the word of God shall not pass
				   away. It is firmer than mountains of brass. At the end, the vision will
				   speak and not lie. The decree shall bring forth, and all wicked men
				   shall know that God is the Lord, that he is a God of truth, and that
				   they are fools who will not depend on his word. The wicked of the old
				   world counted Noah a fool for depending so much on the word of God, as
				   to put himself to all the fatigue and expense of building the ark; but
				   the event showed that they themselves were the fools, and that he was
				   wise.
				
				   2. Consider that the Spirit of God will not always strive with you; nor
				   will his long suffering always wait upon you. So God said concerning
				   the inhabitants of the old world, Gen. 4:3 "My Spirit shall not always
				   strive with man, for that he also is flesh; yet his days shall be a
				   hundred and twenty years." All this while God was striving with them.
				   It was a day of grace with them, and God's long-suffering all this
				   while waited upon them: 1 Peter 3:20, "Which sometime were disobedient,
				   when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while
				   the ark was a preparing." All this while they had an opportunity to
				   escape, if they would but hearken and believe God. Even after the ark
				   was finished, which seems to have been but little before the flood
				   came, still there was an opportunity; the door of the ark stood open
				   for some time. There was some time during which Noah was employed in
				   laying up stores in the ark. Even then it was not too late; the door of
				   the ark yet stood open.-About a week before the flood came, Noah was
				   commanded to begin to gather in the beasts and birds. During this last
				   week still the door of the ark stood open. But on the very day that the
				   flood began to come, while the rain was yet withheld, Noah and his
				   wife, his three sons, and their wives, went into the ark; and we are
				   told, Gen. 7:16, that "God shut him in. Then the day of God's patience
				   was past; the door of the ark was shut; God himself, who shuts and no
				   man opens, shut the door. Then all hope of their escaping the flood was
				   past; it was too late to repent that they had not hearkened to Noah's
				   warnings, and had not entered into the ark while the door stood open.
				
				   After Noah and his family had entered into the ark, and God had shut
				   them in, after the windows of heaven were opened, and they saw how the
				   waters were poured down out of heaven, we may suppose that many of
				   those who were near came running to the door of the ark, knocking, and
				   crying most piteously for entrance. But it was too late; God himself
				   had shut the door, and Noah had no license, and probably no power, to
				   open it. We may suppose, they stood knocking and calling, Open to us,
				   open to us; O let us in; we beg that we may be let in. And probably
				   some of them pleaded old acquaintance with Noah; that they had always
				   been his neighbors, and had even helped him to build the ark. But all
				   was in vain. There they stood till the waters of the flood came, and
				   without mercy swept them away from the door of the ark.
				
				   So it will be with you, if you continue to refuse to hearken to the
				   warnings which are given you. Now God is striving with you; now he is
				   warning you of the approaching flood, and calling upon you Sabbath
				   after Sabbath. Now the door of the ark stands open. But God's Spirit
				   will not always strive with you; his long-suffering will not always
				   wait upon you. There is an appointed day of God's patience, which is as
				   certainly limited as it was to the old world. God hath set your bounds,
				   which you cannot pass. Though now warnings are continued in plenty, yet
				   there will be last knocks and last calls, the last that ever you shall
				   hear. When the appointed time shall be elapsed, God will shut the door,
				   and you shall never see it open again; for God shutteth, and no man
				   openeth.-If you improve not your opportunity before that time, you will
				   cry in vain, "Lord, Lord, open to us," Matt. 25:11, and Luke 23:25, &c.
				   While you shall stand at the door with your piteous cries, the flood of
				   God's wrath will come upon you, overwhelm you, and you shall not
				   escape. The tempest shall carry you away without mercy, and you shall
				   be forever swallowed up and lost.
				
				   3. Consider how mighty the billows of divine wrath will be when they
				   shall come. The waters of Noah's flood were very great. The deluge was
				   vast; it was very deep; the billows reached fifteen cubits above the
				   highest mountains; and it was an ocean which had no shore; signifying
				   the greatness of that wrath which is coming on wicked men in another
				   world, which will be like a mighty flood of waters overwhelming them,
				   and rising vastly high over their heads, with billows reaching to the
				   very heavens. Those billows will be higher and heavier than mountains
				   on their poor souls. The wrath of God will be an ocean without shores,
				   as Noah's flood was: it will be misery that will have no end. The
				   misery of the damned in hell can be better represented by nothing, than
				   by a deluge of misery, a mighty deluge of wrath, which will be ten
				   thousand times worse than a deluge of waters; for it will be a deluge
				   of liquid fire, as in the Scriptures it is called a lake of fire and
				   brimstone.-At the end of the world all the wicked shall be swallowed up
				   in a vast deluge of fire, which shall be as great and as mighty as
				   Noah's deluge of water. See 2 Pet. 3:5, 6, 7. After that the wicked
				   will have mighty billows of fire and brimstone eternally rolling over
				   their poor souls, and their miserable tormented bodies. Those billows
				   may be called vast liquid mountains of fire and brimstone. And when one
				   billow shall have gone over their heads, another shall follow, without
				   intermission, giving them no rest day nor night to all eternity.
				
				   4. This flood of wrath will probably come upon you suddenly, when you
				   all think little of it, and it shall seem far from you. So the flood
				   came upon the old world. See Matt. 24:36, &c. Probably many of them
				   were surprised in the night by the waters bursting suddenly in at their
				   doors, or under the foundations of their houses, coming in upon them in
				   their beds. For when the fountains of the great deep were broken up,
				   the waters, as observed before, burst forth in mighty torrents. To such
				   a sudden surprise of the wicked of the old world in the night, probably
				   that alludes in Job 27:20, "Terrors take hold on him as waters; a
				   tempest stealeth him away in the night." So destruction is wont to come
				   on wicked men, who hear many warnings of approaching destruction, and
				   yet will not be influenced by them. For "he that is often reproved, and
				   hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without
				   remedy," Prov. xxix. 1. And "when they shall say, Peace and safety;
				   then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
				   child, and they shall not escape," 1 Thess. 5:3.
				
				   5. If you will not hearken to the many warnings which are given you of
				   approaching destruction, you will be guilty of more than brutish
				   madness. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." They
				   know upon whom they are dependent, and whom they must obey, and act
				   accordingly. But you, so long as you neglect your own salvation, act as
				   if you knew not God, your Creator and Proprietor, nor your dependence
				   upon him. The very beasts, when they see signs of an approaching storm,
				   will betake themselves to their dens for shelter. Yet you, when
				   abundantly warned of the approaching storm of divine vengeance, will
				   not fly to the hiding-place from the storm, and the covert from the
				   tempest. The sparrow, the swallow, and other birds, when they are
				   forewarned of approaching winter, will betake themselves to a safer
				   climate. Yet you who have been often forewarned of the piercing blasts
				   of divine wrath, will not, in order to escape them, enter into the New
				   Jerusalem, of most mild and salubrious air, though the gate stands wide
				   open to receive you. The very ants will be diligent in summer to lay up
				   for winter: yet you will do nothing to lay up in store a good
				   foundation against the time to come. Balaam's ass would not run upon a
				   drawn sword, though his master, for the sake of gain, would expose
				   himself to the sword of God's wrath; and so God made the dumb ass, both
				   in words and actions, to rebuke the madness of the prophet, 1 Pet. ii.
				   16. In like manner, you, although you have been oft warned that the
				   sword of God's wrath is drawn against you, and will certainly be thrust
				   through you, if you proceed in your present course, still proceed,
				   regardless of the consequence.
				
				   So God made the very beasts and birds of the old world to rebuke the
				   madness of the men of that day: for they, even all sorts of them, fled
				   to the ark while the door was yet open: which the men of that day
				   refused to do; God hereby, thus signifying, that their folly was
				   greater than that of the very brute creatures.-Such folly and madness
				   are you guilty of; who refuse to hearken to the warnings that are given
				   you of the approaching flood of the wrath of God.
				
				   You have been once more warned to-day, while the door of the ark yet
				   stands open. You have, as it were, once again heard the knocks of the
				   hammer and axe in the building of the ark, to put you in mind that a
				   flood is approaching. Take heed therefore that you do not still stop
				   your ears, treat these warnings with a regardless heart, and still
				   neglect the great work which you have to do lest the flood of wrath
				   suddenly come upon you, sweep you away, and there be no remedy.

				Safety, Fulness, and Sweet Refreshment in Christ
				
				    Isaiah 32:2 -- And a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a
				    covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of
				    a great rock in a weary land.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   In these words we may observe,
				
				   1. The person who is here prophesied of and commended, viz. the Lord
				   Jesus Christ, the King spoken of in the preceding verse, who shall
				   reign in righteousness. This King is abundantly prophesied of in the
				   Old Testament, and especially in this prophecy of Isaiah. Glorious
				   predictions were from time to time uttered by the prophets concerning
				   that great King who was to come: there is no subject which is spoken of
				   in so magnificent and exalted a style by the prophets of the Old
				   Testament, as the Messiah. They saw his day and rejoiced, and searched
				   diligently, together with the angels, into those things. I Peter 1:11,
				   12. "Searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which
				   was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
				   Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed,
				   that not unto themselves, but unto us, they did minister the things,
				   which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel
				   unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the
				   angels desire to look into."
				
				   We are told here that "a man shall be a hiding-place from the wind,"
				   &c. There is an emphasis in the words, that "a man" should be this. If
				   these things had been said of God, it would not be strange under the
				   Old Testament; for God is frequently called a hiding-place for his
				   people, a refuge in time of trouble, a strong rock, and a high tower.
				   But what is so remarkable is, that they are said of "a man." But this
				   is a prophecy of the Son of God incarnate.
				
				   2. The things here foretold of him, and the commendations given him.
				   "He shall be a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the
				   tempest:" that is, he shall be the safety and defence of his people, to
				   which they shall flee for protection in the time of their danger and
				   trouble. To him they shall flee, as one who is abroad, and sees a
				   terrible storm arising, makes haste to some shelter to secure himself;
				   so that however furious is the tempest, yet he is safe within, and the
				   wind and rain, though they beat never so impetuously upon the roof and
				   walls, are no annoyance unto him.
				
				   He shall be as "rivers of water in a dry place." This is an allusion to
				   the deserts of Arabia, which was an exceedingly hot and dry country.
				   One may travel there many days, and see no sign of a river, brook, or
				   spring, nothing but a dry and parched wilderness; so that travelers are
				   ready to be consumed with thirst, as the children of Israel were when
				   they were in this wilderness, when they were faint because there was no
				   water. Now when a man finds Jesus Christ, he is like one that has been
				   traveling in those deserts till he is almost consumed with thirst, and
				   who as last finds a river of cool and clear water. And Christ was
				   typified by the river of water that issued out of the rock for the
				   children of Israel in this desert: he is compared to a river, because
				   there is such a plenty and fulness in him.
				
				   He is the "shadow of a great rock in a weary land." Allusion is still
				   made to the desert of Arabia. It is not said, as the shadow of a tree,
				   because in some places of that country, there is nothing but dry sand
				   and rocks for a vast space together, not a tree to be seen; and the sun
				   beats exceedingly hot upon the sands, and all the shade to be found
				   there, where travellers can rest and shelter themselves from the
				   scorching sun, is under some great rock. They who come to Christ find
				   such rest and refreshment as the weary traveller in that hot and
				   desolate country finds under the shadow of a great rock.
				
				   We propose to speak to three propositions that are explicatory of the
				   several parts of the text.
				
				   I. There is in Christ Jesus abundant foundation of peace and safety for
				   those who are in fear and danger. "A man shall be a hiding-place from
				   the wind, a covert from the tempest."
				
				   II. There is in Christ provision for the satisfaction, and full
				   contentment, of the needy and thirsty soul. He shall be "as rivers of
				   water in a dry place."
				
				   III. There are quiet rest and sweet refreshment in Christ Jesus for him
				   who is weary. He shall be "as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
				   land."
				
				   I. There is in Christ Jesus abundant foundation of peace and safety for
				   those who are in fear and danger.
				
				   The fears and dangers to which men are subject, are of two kinds;
				   temporal and eternal. Men are frequently in distress from fear of
				   temporal evils. We live in an evil world, where we are liable to an
				   abundance of sorrows and calamities. A great part of our lives is spent
				   in sorrowing for present or past evils, and in fearing those which are
				   future. What poor, distressed creatures are we, when God is pleased to
				   send his judgements among us! If he visits a place with mortal and
				   prevailing sickness, what terror seizes our hearts! If any person is
				   taken sick, and trembles for his life, or if our near friends are at
				   the point of death, or in many other dangers, how fearful is our
				   condition! Now there is sufficient foundation for peace and safety to
				   those exercised with such fears, and brought into such dangers. But
				   Christ is a refuge in all trouble; there is a foundation for rational
				   support and peace in him, whatever threatens us. He, whose heart is
				   fixed, trusting in Christ, need not be afraid of any evil tidings. "As
				   the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Christ is round about them
				   that fear him."
				
				   But it is the other kind of fear and danger to which we have a
				   principal respect; the fear and danger of God's wrath. The fears of a
				   terrified conscience, the fearful expectation of the dire fruits of
				   sin, and the resentment of an angry God, these are infinitely the most
				   dreadful. If men are in danger of those things, and are not asleep,
				   they will be more terrified than with the fears of any outward evil.
				   Men are in a most deplorable condition, as they are by nature exposed
				   to God's wrath; and if they are sensible how dismal their case is, will
				   be in dreadful fears and dismal expectations.
				
				   God is pleased to make some sensible of their true condition. He lets
				   them see the storm that threatens them, how black the clouds are, and
				   how impregnated with thunder, that it is a burning tempest, that they
				   are in danger of being speedily overtaken by it, that they have nothing
				   to shelter themselves from it, and that they are in danger of being
				   taken away by the fierceness of his anger.
				
				   It is a fearful condition when one is smitten with a sense of the
				   dreadfulness of God's wrath, when he has his heart impressed with the
				   conviction that the great God is not reconciled to him, that he holds
				   him guilty of these and those sins, and that he is angry enough with
				   him to condemn him for ever. It is dreadful to lie down and rise up, it
				   is dreadful to eat and drink, and to walk about, in God's anger from
				   day to day. One, in such a case, is ready to be afraid of every thing;
				   he is afraid of meeting God's wrath wherever he goes. He has no peace
				   in his mind, but there is a dreadful sound in his ears; his mind is
				   afflicted and tossed with tempest, and not comforted, and courage is
				   ready to fail, and the spirit ready to sink with fear; for how can a
				   poor worm bear the wrath of the great God, and what would not he give
				   for peace of conscience, what would not he give if he could find
				   safety! When such fears exist to a great degree, or are continued a
				   long time, they greatly enfeeble the heart, and bring it to a trembling
				   posture and disposition.
				
				   Now for such as these there is abundant foundation for peace and safety
				   in Jesus Christ, and this will appear from the following things:
				
				   1. Christ has undertaken to save all such from what they fear, if they
				   come to him. It is his professional business; the work in which he
				   engaged before the foundation of the world. It is what he always had in
				   his thoughts and intentions; he undertook from everlasting to be the
				   refuge of those that are afraid of God's wrath. His wisdom is such,
				   that he would never undertake a work for which he is not sufficient. If
				   there were some in so dreadful a case that he was not able to defend
				   them, or so guilty that it was not fit that he should save them, then
				   he never would have undertaken for them. Those who are in trouble and
				   distressing fear, if they come to Jesus Christ, have this to ease them
				   of their fears, that Christ has promised them that he will protect
				   them; that they come upon his invitation; that Christ has plighted his
				   faith for their security if they will close with him; and that he is
				   engaged by covenant to God the Father that he will save those afflicted
				   and distressed souls that come to him.
				
				   Christ, by his own free act, has made himself the surety of such, he
				   has voluntarily put himself in their stead; and if justice has any
				   thing against them, he has undertaken to answer for them. By his own
				   act, he has engaged to be responsible for them; so that if they have
				   exposed themselves to God's wrath, and to the stroke of justice, it is
				   not their concern, but his, how to answer or satisfy for what they have
				   done. Let there be never so much wrath that they have deserved, they
				   are as safe as if they never had deserved any; because he has
				   undertaken to stand for them, let it be more or less. If they are in
				   Christ Jesus, the storm does of course light on him, and not on them;
				   as when we are under a good shelter, the storm, that would otherwise
				   come upon our heads, lights upon the shelter.
				
				   2. He is chosen and appointed of the Father to this work. There needs
				   to be no fear nor jealousy, whether the Father will approve of this
				   undertaking of Christ Jesus, whether he will accept of him as a surety,
				   or whether he will be willing that his wrath should be poured upon his
				   own dear Son, instead of us miserable sinners. For there was an
				   agreement with him concerning it before the world was; it was a thing
				   much upon God's heart, that his Son Jesus Christ should undertake this
				   work, and it was the Father that sent him into the world. It is as much
				   the act of God the Father as it is of the Son. Therefore, when Christ
				   was near the time of his death, he tells the Father that he had
				   finished the work which he gave him to do. Christ is often called God's
				   elect, or his chosen, because he was chosen by the Father for his work;
				   and God's anointed, for the words Messiah and Christ signify anointed,
				   because he is by God appointed and fitted for this work.
				
				   3. If we are in Christ Jesus, justice and the law have its course with
				   respect to our sins, without our hurt. The foundation of the sinner's
				   fear and distress is the justice and the law of God; they are against
				   him, and they are unalterable, they must have their course. Every jot
				   and tittle of the law must be fulfilled, heaven and earth shall be
				   destroyed, rather than justice should not take place; there is no
				   possibility of sin's escaping justice.
				
				   But yet if the distressed trembling soul who is afraid of justice,
				   would fly to Christ, he would be a safe hiding-place. Justice and the
				   threatening of the law will have their course as fully, while he is
				   safe and untouched, as if he were to be eternally destroyed. Christ
				   bears the stroke of justice, and the curse of the law falls fully upon
				   him; Christ bears all that vengeance that belongs to the sin that has
				   been committed by him, and there is no need of its being borne twice
				   over. His temporal sufferings, by reason of the infinite dignity of his
				   person, are fully equivalent to the eternal sufferings of a mere
				   creature. And then his sufferings answer for him who flees to him as
				   well as if they were his own, for indeed they are his own by virtue of
				   the union between Christ and him. Christ has made himself one with
				   them; he is the head, and they are the members. Therefore, if Christ
				   suffers for the believer, there is no need of his suffering; and what
				   needs he to be afraid? His safety is not only consistent with absolute
				   justice, but it is consistent with the tenor of the law. The law leaves
				   fair room for such a thing as the answering of a surety. If the end of
				   punishment in maintaining the authority of the law and the majesty of
				   the government is fully secured by the sufferings of Christ as his
				   surety, then the law of God, according to the true and fair
				   interpretation of it, has its course as much in the sufferings of
				   Christ, as it would have in his own sufferings. The threatening, "thou
				   shalt surely die," is properly fulfilled in the death of Christ, as it
				   is fairly to be understood. Therefore if those who are afraid will go
				   to Jesus Christ, they need to fear nothing from the threatening of the
				   law. The threatening of the law has nothing to do with them.
				
				   4. Those who come to Christ, need not be afraid of God's wrath for
				   their sins; for God's honour will not suffer by their escaping
				   punishment and being made happy. The wounded soul is sensible that he
				   has affronted the majesty of God, and looks upon God as a vindicator of
				   his honour; as a jealous God that will not be mocked, an infinitely
				   great God that will not bear to be affronted, that will not suffer his
				   authority and majesty to be trampled on, that will not bear that his
				   kindness should be abused. A view of God in this light terrifies
				   awakened souls. They think how exceedingly they have sinned, how they
				   have sinned against light, against frequent and long-continued calls
				   and warnings; and how they have slighted mercy, and been guilty of
				   turning the grace of God into lasciviousness, taking encouragement from
				   God's mercy to go on in sin against him; and they fear that God is so
				   affronted at the contempt and slight which they have cast upon him,
				   that he, being careful of his honour, will never forgive them, but will
				   punish them. But if they go to Christ, the honour of God's majesty and
				   authority will not be in the least hurt by their being freed and made
				   happy. For what Christ has done has repaired God's honour to the full.
				   It is a greater honour to God's authority and majesty, that, rather
				   than it should be wronged, so glorious a person would suffer what the
				   law required. It is surely a wonderful display of the honour of God's
				   majesty, to see an infinite and eternal person dying for its being
				   wronged. And then Christ by his obedience, by that obedience which he
				   undertook for our sakes, has honoured God abundantly more than the sins
				   of any of us have dishonoured him, how many soever, and how great
				   soever. How great an honour is it to God's law that so great a person
				   is willing to submit to it, and to obey it! God hates our sins, but not
				   more than he delights in Christ's obedience which he performed on
				   account. This is a sweet savour to him, a savour of rest. God is
				   abundantly compensated, he desires no more; Christ's righteousness is
				   of infinite worthiness and merit.
				
				   5. Christ is a person so dear to the Father, that those who are in
				   Christ need not be at all jealous of being accepted upon his account.
				   If Christ is accepted they must of consequence be accepted, for they
				   are in Christ, as members, as parts, as the same. They are the body of
				   Christ, his flesh and his bones. They that are in Christ Jesus, are one
				   spirit; and therefore, if God loves Christ Jesus, he must of necessity
				   accept of those that are in him, and that are of him. But Christ is a
				   person exceedingly dear to the Father, the Father's love to the Son is
				   really infinite. God necessarily loves the Son; God could as soon cease
				   to be, as cease to love the Son. He is God's elect, in whom his soul
				   delighteth; he is his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased; he loved
				   him before the foundation of the world, and had infinite delight in him
				   from all eternity.
				
				   A terrified conscience, therefore, may have rest here, and abundant
				   satisfaction that he is safe in Christ, and that there is not the least
				   danger but that he shall be accepted, and that God will be at peace
				   with him in Christ.
				
				   6. God has given an open testimony that Christ has done and suffered
				   enough, and that he is satisfied with it, by his raising him from the
				   dead. Christ, when he was in his passion, was in the hands of justice,
				   he was God's prisoner for believers, and it pleased God to bruise him,
				   and put him to grief, and to bring him into a low state; and when he
				   raised him from the dead, he set him at liberty, whereby he declared
				   that it was enough. If God was not satisfied, why did he set Christ at
				   liberty so soon? he was in the hands of justice, why did not God pour
				   out more wrath upon him, and hold him in the chains of darkness longer?
				   God raised him up and opened the prison doors to him, because he
				   desired no more. And now surely there is free admittance for all
				   sinners into God's favour through this risen Saviour, there is enough
				   done, and God is satisfied; as he has declared and sealed to it by the
				   resurrection of Christ, who is alive, and lives for evermore, and is
				   making intercession for poor, distressed souls that come unto him.
				
				   7. Christ has the dispensation of safety and deliverance in his own
				   hands, so that we need not fear but that, if we are united to him, we
				   may be safe. God has given him all power in heaven and in earth, to
				   give eternal life to whomsoever comes to him. He is made head over all
				   things to the church, and the work of salvation is left with himself,
				   he may save whom he pleases, and defend those that are in him by his
				   own power. What greater ground of confidence could God have given us
				   than that the Mediator, who died for us, and intercedes for us, should
				   have committed to him the dispensation of the very thing which he died
				   to purchase and for which he intercedes?
				
				   8. Christ's love, and compassion, and gracious disposition, are such
				   that we may be sure he is inclined to receive all who come to him. If
				   he should not do it, he would fail of his own undertaking, and also of
				   his promise to the Father, and to us; and his wisdom and faithfulness
				   will not allow of that. But he is so full of love and kindness that he
				   is disposed to nothing but to receive and defend us, if we come to him.
				   Christ is exceedingly ready to pity us, his arms are open to receive
				   us, he delights to receive distressed souls that come to him, and to
				   protect them; he would gather them as a hen gathereth her chickens
				   under her wings; it is a work that he exceedingly rejoices in, because
				   he delights in acts of love, and pity, and mercy.
				
				   I shall take occasion from what now has been said, to invite those who
				   are afraid of God's wrath, to come to Christ Jesus. You are indeed in a
				   dreadful condition. It is dismal to have God's wrath impending over our
				   heads, and not to know how soon it will fall upon us. And you are in
				   some measure sensible that it is a dreadful condition, you are full of
				   fear and trouble, and you know not where to flee for help; your mind
				   is, as it were, tossed with a tempest. But how lamentable is it, that
				   you should spend your life in such a condition, when Christ would
				   shelter you, as a hen shelters her chickens under her wings, if you
				   were but willing; and that you should live such a fearful, distressed
				   life, when there is so much provision made for your safety in Christ
				   Jesus!
				
				   How happy would you be if your hearts were but persuaded to close with
				   Jesus Christ! Then you would be out of all danger: whatever storms and
				   tempests were without, you might rest securely within; you might hear
				   the rushing of the wind, and the thunder roar abroad, while you are
				   safe in this hiding-place. O be persuaded to hide yourself in Christ
				   Jesus! What greater assurance of safety can you desire? He has
				   undertaken to defend and save you, if you will come to him: he looks
				   upon it as his work; he engaged in it before the world was, and he has
				   given his faithful promise which he will not break; and if you will but
				   make your flight there, his life shall be for yours; he will answer for
				   you, you shall have nothing to do but rest quietly in him; you may
				   stand still and see what the Lord will do for you. If there be any
				   thing to suffer, the suffering is Christ's, you will have nothing to
				   suffer; if there be any thing to be done, the doing of it is Christ's,
				   you will have nothing to do but to stand still and behold it.
				
				   You will certainly be accepted of the Father if your soul lays hold of
				   Jesus Christ. Christ is chosen and anointed of the Father, and sent
				   forth for this very end, to save those that are in danger and fear; and
				   he is greatly beloved of God, even infinitely, and he will accept of
				   those that are in him. Justice and the law will not be against you, if
				   you are in Christ; that threatening, "in the day that thou eatest thou
				   shalt die," in the proper sense of it, will not touch you. The majesty
				   and honour of God are not against you. You need not be afraid but that
				   you shall be justified, if you come to him; there is an act of
				   justification already past and declared for all who come to Christ by
				   the resurrection of Christ, and as soon as ever you come, you are by
				   that declared free. If you come to Christ it will be a sure sign that
				   Christ loved you from all eternity, and that he died for you; and you
				   may be sure if he died for you, he will not lose the end of his death,
				   for the dispensation of life is committed unto him.
				
				   You need not, therefore, continue in so dangerous a condition; there is
				   help for you. You need not stand out in the storm so long, as there is
				   so good a shelter near you, whose doors are open to receive you. O make
				   haste, therefore, unto that man who is a hiding-place from the wind,
				   and a covert from the tempest!
				
				   Let this truth also cause believers more to prize the Lord Jesus
				   Christ. Consider that it is he, and he only, who defends you from
				   wrath, and that he is a safe defence; your defence is a high tower;
				   your city of refuge is impregnable. There is no rock like your rock.
				   There is none like Christ, "the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
				   heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky; the eternal God
				   is thy refuge, and underneath are everlasting arms." He in whom you
				   trust is a buckler to all that trust in him. O prize that Saviour, who
				   keeps your soul in safety, while thousands of others are carried away
				   by the fury of God's anger, and are tossed with raging and burning
				   tempests in hell! O, how much better is your case than theirs! and to
				   whom is it owing but to the Lord Jesus Christ? Remember what was once
				   your case, and what it is now, and prize Jesus Christ.
				
				   And let those christians who are in doubts and fears concerning their
				   condition, renewedly fly to Jesus Christ, who is a hiding-place from
				   the wind, and a covert from the tempest. Most Christians are at times
				   afraid whether they shall not miscarry at last. Such doubtings are
				   always through some want of the exercise of faith, and the best remedy
				   for them is a renewed resort of the soul to this hiding-place; the same
				   act which at first gave comfort and peace, will give peace again. They
				   that clearly see the sufficiency of Christ, and the safety of
				   committing themselves to him to save them from what they fear, will
				   rest in it that Christ will defend them; be directed therefore at such
				   times to do as the psalmist. Psalm 56:3, 4. "What time I am afraid, I
				   will trust in thee. In God I will praise his word; in God I have put my
				   trust: I will not fear what flesh can do unto me."
				
				   II. There is provision in Christ for the satisfaction and full
				   contentment of the needy and thirsty soul.
				
				   This is the sense of those words in the text, "as rivers of water in a
				   dry place," in a dry and parched wilderness, where there is a great
				   want of water, and where travellers are ready to be destroyed with
				   thirst, such as was that wilderness in which the children of Israel
				   wandered. This comparison is used elsewhere in the Scriptures. Psalm
				   63:1. "O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
				   thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
				   land, where no water is." Psalm 143:6. "I stretch forth my hands unto
				   thee; my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land." Those who
				   travel in such a land, who wander in such a wilderness, are in extreme
				   need of water; they are ready to perish for the want of it; and thus
				   they have a great thirst and longing for it.
				
				   It is said that Christ is a river of water, because there is such a
				   fulness in him, so plentiful a provision for the satisfaction of the
				   needy and longing soul. When one is extremely thirsty, though it is not
				   a small draught of water will satisfy him, yet when he comes to a
				   river, he finds a fulness, there he may drink full draughts. Christ is
				   like a river, in that he has a sufficiency not only for one thirsty
				   soul, but by supplying him the fountain is not lessened; there is not
				   the less afforded to those who come afterwards. A thirsty man does not
				   sensibly lessen a river by quenching his thirst.
				   Christ is like a river in another respect. A river is continually
				   flowing, there are fresh supplies of water coming from the
				   fountain-head continually, so that a man may live by it, and be
				   supplied with water all his life. So Christ is an ever-flowing
				   fountain; he is continually supplying his people, and the fountain is
				   not spent. They who live upon Christ, may have fresh supplies from him
				   to all eternity; they may have an increase of blessedness that is new,
				   and new still, and which never will come to an end.
				
				   In illustrating this second proposition, I shall inquire,
				
				   1. What it is that the soul of every man naturally and necessarily
				   craves.
				
				   First. The soul of every man necessarily craves happiness. This is an
				   universal appetite of human nature, that is alike in the good and the
				   bad; it is as universal as the very essence of the soul, because it
				   necessarily and immediately flows from that essence. It is not only
				   natural to all mankind, but to the angels; it is universal among all
				   reasonable, intelligent beings, in heaven, earth, or hell, because it
				   flows necessarily from an intelligent nature. There is no rational
				   being, nor can there be any, without a love and desire of happiness. It
				   is impossible that there should be any creature made that should love
				   misery, or not love happiness, since it implies a manifest
				   contradiction; for the very notion of misery is to be in a state that
				   nature abhors, and the notion of happiness, is to be in such a state as
				   is most agreeable to nature.
				
				   Therefore, this craving of happiness must be insuperable, and what
				   never can be changed; it never can be overcome, or in any way abated.
				   Young and old love happiness alike, and good and bad, wise and unwise;
				   though there is a great variety as to men's ideas of happiness. Some
				   think it is to be found in one thing, and some in another; yet, as to
				   the desire of happiness in general, there is no variety. There are
				   particular appetites that may be restrained, and kept under, and
				   conquered, but this general appetite for happiness nev-er can be.
				
				   Secondly. The soul of every man craves a happiness that is equal to the
				   capacity of his nature. The soul of man is like a vessel; the capacity
				   of the soul is as the largeness or contents of the vessel. And
				   therefore, if man has much pleasure and happiness, yet if the vessel is
				   not full, the craving will not cease. Every creature is restless till
				   it enjoys what is equal to the capacity of its nature. Thus we may
				   observe in the brutes; when they have that which is suitable to their
				   nature, and proportional to their capacity, they are contented. Man is
				   of such a nature, that he is capable of an exceedingly great degree of
				   happiness; he is made of a vastly higher nature than the brutes, and
				   therefore he must have vastly higher happiness to satisfy. The
				   pleasures of the outward senses which content the beasts, will not
				   content man. He has other faculties of a higher nature that stand in
				   need of something to fill them; if the sense be satiated, yet if the
				   faculties of the soul are not filled, man will be in a craving restless
				   state.
				
				   It is more especially by reason of the faculty of understanding that
				   the soul is capable of so great a happiness, and desires so much. The
				   understanding is an exceedingly extensive faculty; it extends itself
				   beyond the limits of earth, beyond the limits of the creation. As we
				   are capable of understanding immensely more than we do understand, who
				   can tell how far the understanding of men is capable of stretching
				   itself? and as the understanding enlarges, the desire will enlarge with
				   it. It must therefore be an incomprehensible object that must satisfy
				   the soul; it will never be contented with that, and that only, to which
				   it can see an end, it will never be satisfied with that happiness to
				   which it can find a bottom. A man may seem to take contentment for a
				   little while in a finite object, but after he has had a little
				   experience, he finds that he wants something besides. This is very
				   apparent from the experience of this restless craving world. Every one
				   is inquiring, Who will show us any good?
				
				   2. Men in their fallen state, are in very great want of this happiness.
				   They were once in the enjoyment of it, but mankind are sunk to a very
				   low estate; we are naturally poor, destitute creatures. We came naked
				   into the world, and our souls as well as our bodies are in a wretched,
				   miserable condition; we are so far from having food to eat suitable to
				   our nature, that we are greedy after the husks which the swine do eat.
				
				   The poverty of man in a natural condition, appears in his discontented,
				   craving spirit; it shows that the soul is very empty, when, like the
				   horse-leech, it cries, "Give, give, and saith not, It is enough." We
				   are naturally like the prodigal, for we once were rich, but we departed
				   from our father's house, and have squandered away our wealth, and are
				   become poor, hungry, famishing wretches. Men in a natural condition may
				   find something to gratify their senses, but there is nothing to feed
				   the soul; that more noble and more essential part perishes for lack of
				   food. They may fare sumptuously every day, they may pamper their
				   bodies, but the soul cannot be fed from a sumptuous table; they may
				   drink wine in bowls, yet the spiritual part is not refreshed. The
				   superior faculties want to be supplied as well as the inferior. True
				   poverty and true misery consist in the want of those things of which
				   our spiritual part stands in need.
				
				   3. Those sinners who are thoroughly awakened, are sensible of their
				   great want. Multitudes of men are not sensible of their miserable,
				   needy condition. There are many who are thus poor, and think themselves
				   rich, and increased in goods. Indeed there are no natural men that have
				   true contentment: they are all restless, and crying, "Who will show us
				   any good?" but multitudes are not sensible how exceedingly necessitous
				   is their condition. But the thoroughly awakened soul sees that he is
				   very far from true happiness, that those things which he possesses will
				   never make him happy; that for all his outward possessions he is
				   wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. He becomes
				   sensible of the short continuance and uncertainty of those things, and
				   their insufficiency to satisfy a troubled conscience. He wants
				   something else to give him peace and ease. If you would tell him that
				   he might have a kingdom, it would not quiet him; he desires to have his
				   sins pardoned, and to be at peace with his Judge. He is poor, and he
				   becomes as a beggar; he comes and cries for help. He does not thirst,
				   because he as yet sees where true happiness is to be found, but because
				   he sees that he has it not, and cannot find it. He is without comfort,
				   and does not know where to find it, but he longs for it. O, what would
				   he not give, if he could find some satisfying peace and comfort!
				
				   Such are those hungry, thirsty souls that Christ so often invites to
				   come to him. Isaiah 55:1, 2. "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to
				   the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come,
				   buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye
				   spend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which
				   satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is
				   good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness." "If any man thirst,
				   let him come unto me and drink; and he that is athirst, let him come
				   and take of the water of life freely."
				
				   4. There is in Christ Jesus provision for the full satisfaction and
				   contentment of such as these.
				
				   First. The excellency of Christ is such, that the discovery of it is
				   exceedingly contenting and satisfying to the soul. The inquiry of the
				   soul is after that which is most excellent. The carnal soul imagines
				   that earthly things are excellent; one thinks riches most excellent,
				   another has the highest esteem of honour, and to another carnal
				   pleasure appears the most excellent; but the soul cannot find
				   contentment in any of these things, because it soon finds an end to
				   their excellency. Worldly men imagine, that there is true excellency
				   and true happiness in those things which they are pursuing. They think
				   that if they could but obtain them, they should be happy; and when they
				   obtain them, and cannot find happiness, they look for happiness in
				   something else, and are still upon the pursuit.
				
				   But Christ Jesus has true excellency, and so great excellency, that
				   when they come to see it they look no further, but the mind rests
				   there. It sees a transcendent glory and an ineffable sweetness in him;
				   it sees that till now it has been pursuing shadows, but that now it has
				   found the substance; that before it had been seeking happiness in the
				   stream, but that now it has found the ocean. The excellency of Christ
				   is an object adequate to the natural cravings of the soul, and is
				   sufficient to fill the capacity. It is an infinite excellency, such an
				   one as the mind desires, in which it can find no bounds; and the more
				   the mind is used to it, the more excellent it appears. Every new
				   discovery makes this beauty appear more ravishing, and the mind sees no
				   end; here is room enough for the mind to go deeper and deeper, and
				   never come to the bottom. The soul is exceedingly ravished when it
				   first looks on this beauty, and it is never weary of it. The mind never
				   has any satiety, but Christ's excellency is always fresh and new, and
				   tends as much to delight, after it has been seen a thousand or ten
				   thousand years, as when it was seen the first moment. The excellency of
				   Christ is an object suited to the superior faculties of man, it is
				   suited to entertain the faculty of reason and understanding, and there
				   is nothing so worthy about which the understanding can be employed as
				   this excellency; no other object is so great, noble, and exalted.
				
				   This excellency of Jesus Christ is the suitable food of the rational
				   soul. The soul that comes to Christ, feeds upon this, and lives upon
				   it; it is that bread which came down from heaven, of which he that eats
				   shall not die; it is angels' food, it is that wine and milk that is
				   given without money, and without price. This is that fatness in which
				   the believing soul delights itself; here the longing soul may be
				   satisfied, and the hungry soul may be filled with goodness. The delight
				   and contentment that is to be found here, passeth understanding, and is
				   unspeakable and full of glory. It is impossible for those who have
				   tasted of this fountain, and know the sweetness of it, ever to forsake
				   it. The soul has found the river of water of life, and it desires no
				   other drink; it has found the tree of life, and it desires no other
				   fruit.
				
				   Secondly. The manifestation of the love of Christ gives the soul
				   abundant contentment. This love of Christ is exceedingly sweet and
				   satisfying, it is better than life, because it is the love of a person
				   of such dignity and excellency. The sweetness of his love depends very
				   much upon the greatness of his excellency; so much the more lovely the
				   person, so much the more desirable is his love. How sweet must the love
				   of that person be, who is the eternal Son of God, who is of equal
				   dignity with the Father! How great a happiness must it be to be the
				   object of the love of him who is the Creator of the world, and by whom
				   all things consist, and who is exalted at God's right hand, and made
				   head over principalities and powers in heavenly places, who has all
				   things put under his feet, and is King of kings and Lord of lords, and
				   is the brightness of the Father's glory! Surely to be beloved by him,
				   is enough to satisfy the soul of a worm of the dust.
				
				   This love of Christ is also exceedingly sweet and satisfying from the
				   greatness of it; it is a dying love; such love as never was before
				   seen, and such as no other can parallel. There have been instances of
				   very great love between one earthly friend and another; there was a
				   surpassing love between David and Jonathan. But there never was any
				   such love as Christ has towards believers. The satisfying nature of
				   this love arises also from the sweet fruits of it. Those precious
				   benefits that Christ bestows upon his people, and those precious
				   promises which he has given them, are the fruit of this love; joy and
				   hope are the constant streams that flow from this fountain, from the
				   love of Christ.
				
				   Thirdly. There is provision for the satisfaction and contentment of the
				   thirsty longing soul in Christ, as he is the way to the Father; not
				   only from the fulness of excellency and grace which he has in his own
				   person, but as by him we may come to God, may be reconciled to him, and
				   may be made happy in his favour and love. The poverty and want of the
				   soul in its natural state consist in its being separated from God, for
				   God is the riches and the happiness of the creature. But we naturally
				   are alienated from God; and God is alienated from us, our Maker is not
				   at peace with us. But in Christ there is a way for a free communication
				   between God and us; for us to come to God, and for God to communicate
				   himself to us by his Spirit. John 14:6. "Jesus saith unto him, I am the
				   way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by
				   me." Ephesians 2:13, 18, 19. "But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes
				   were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For through him we
				   both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now, therefore, ye are
				   no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints,
				   and of the household of God." Christ by being thus the way to the
				   Father, is the way to true happiness and contentment. John 10:9. "I am
				   the door: by me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go
				   in and out, and find pasture." Hence I would take occasion to invite
				   needy, thirsty souls to come to Jesus. "In the last day, that great day
				   of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him
				   come unto me and drink." You that have not yet come to Christ, are in a
				   poor, necessitous condition; you are in a parched wilderness, in a dry
				   and thirsty land. And if you are thoroughly awakened, you are sensible
				   that you are in distress and ready to faint for want of something to
				   satisfy your souls. Come to him who is "as rivers of water in a dry
				   place." There are plenty and fulness in him; he is like a river that is
				   always flowing, you may live by it for ever, and never be in want. Come
				   to him who has such excellency as is sufficient to give full
				   contentment to your soul, who is a person of transcendent glory, and
				   ineffable beauty, where you may entertain the view of your soul for
				   ever without weariness, and without being cloyed. Accept of the offered
				   love of him who is the only-begotten Son of God, and his elect, in whom
				   his soul delighteth. Through Christ, come to God the Father, from whom
				   you have departed by sin. He is the way, the truth, and the life; he is
				   the door, by which if any man enters he shall be saved.
				
				   III. There are quiet rest and sweet refreshment in Christ Jesus, for
				   those that are weary. He is "as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
				   land."
				
				   The comparison that is used in the text is very beautiful and very
				   significative. The dry, barren, and scorched wilderness of Arabia is a
				   very lively representation of the misery that men have brought upon
				   themselves by sin. It is destitute of any inhabitants but lions and
				   tigers and fiery serpents; it is barren and parched, and without any
				   river or spring; it is a land of drought, wherein there is seldom any
				   rain, a land exceedingly hot and uncomfortable. The scorching sunbeams
				   that are ready to consume the spirits of travellers, are a fit
				   representation of terror of conscience, and the inward sense of God's
				   displeasure. And there being no other shade in which travellers may
				   rest, but only here and there that of a great rock, it is a fit
				   representation of Jesus Christ, who came to redeem us from our misery.
				   Christ is often compared to a rock, because he is a sure foundation to
				   builders, and because he is a sure bulwark and defence. They who dwell
				   upon the top of a rock, dwell in a most defensible place; we read of
				   those whose habitation is the munitions of rocks. He may also be
				   compared to a rock, as he is everlasting and unchangeable. A great rock
				   remains stedfast, unmoved, and unbroken by winds and storms from age to
				   age; and therefore God chose a rock to be an emblem of Christ in the
				   wilderness, when he caused water to issue forth for the children of
				   Israel; and the shadow of a great rock is a most fit representation of
				   the refreshment given to weary souls by Jesus Christ.
				
				   1. There is quiet rest and full refreshment in Christ for sinners that
				   are weary and heavy laden with sin. Sin is the most evil and odious
				   thing, as well as the most mischievous and fatal; it is the most mortal
				   poison; it, above all things, hazards life, and endangers the soul,
				   exposes to the loss of all happiness, and to the suffering of all
				   misery, and brings the wrath of God. All men have this dreadful evil
				   hanging about them, and cleaving fast to the soul, and ruling over it,
				   and keeping it in possession, and under absolute command: it hangs like
				   a viper to the heart, or rather holds it as a lion does his prey.
				
				   But yet there are multitudes, who are not sensible of their misery.
				   They are in such a sleep that they are not very unquiet in this
				   condition, it is not very burthensome to them, they are so sottish that
				   they do not know what is their state, and what is like to become of
				   them. But there are others who have their sense so far restored to them
				   that they feel the pain, and see the approaching destruction, and sin
				   lies like a heavy load upon their hearts; it is a load that lies upon
				   them day and night, they cannot lay it down to rest themselves, but it
				   continually oppresses them. It is bound fast unto them, and is ready to
				   sink them down; it is a continual labour of heart, to support itself
				   under this burden. Thus we read of them "that labour, and are heavy
				   laden." Or rather, it is like the scorching heat in a dry wilderness,
				   where the sun beats and burns all the day long; where they have nothing
				   to defend them; where they can find no shade to refresh themselves. If
				   they lay themselves down to rest, it is like lying down in the hot
				   sands, where there is nothing to keep off the heat.
				
				   Here it may be proper to inquire who are weary and heavy laden with
				   sin; and in what sense a sinner may be weary and burdened with sin.
				   Sinners are not wearied with sin from any dislike to it, or dislike of
				   it. There is no sinner that is burdened with sin in the sense in which
				   a godly man carries his indwelling sin, as his daily and greatest
				   burden, because he loathes it, and longs to get rid of it; he would
				   fain be at a great distance from it, and have nothing more to do with
				   it; he is ready to cry out as Paul did, "O wretched man that I am! who
				   shall deliver me from the body of this death?" The unregenerate man has
				   nothing of this nature, for sin is yet his delight, he dearly loves it.
				   If he be under convictions, his love to sin in general is not
				   mortified, he loves it as well as ever, he hides it still as a sweet
				   morsel under his tongue.
				   But there is a difference between being weary and burdened with sin,
				   and being weary of sin. Awakened sinners are weary with sin, but not
				   properly weary of it.
				
				   Therefore, they are only weary of the guilt of sin, the guilt that
				   cleaves to their consciences is that great burden. God has put the
				   sense of feeling into their consciences, that were before as seared
				   flesh, and it is guilt that pains them. The filthiness of sin and its
				   evil nature, as it is an offence to a holy, gracious, and glorious God,
				   is not a burden to them. But it is the connexion between sin and
				   punishment, between sin and God's wrath, that makes it a burden. Their
				   consciences are heavy laden with guilt, which is an obligation to
				   punishment; they see the threatening and curse of the law joined to
				   their sins, and see that the justice of God and his vengeance are
				   against them. They are burdened with their sins, not because there is
				   any odiousness in them, but because there is hell in them. This is the
				   sting of sin, whereby it stings the conscience, and distresses and
				   wearies the soul.
				
				   The guilt of such and such great sins is upon the soul, and the man
				   sees no way to get rid of it, but he has wearisome days and wearisome
				   nights; it makes him ready sometimes to say as the psalmist did, "O
				   that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away and be at rest.
				   Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. I would
				   hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest." But when sinners
				   come to Christ, he takes away that which was their burden, or their sin
				   and guilt, that which was so heavy upon their hearts, that so
				   distressed their minds.
				
				   First. He takes away the guilt of sin, from which the soul before saw
				   no way how it was possible to be freed, and which, if it was not
				   removed, led to eternal destruction. When the sinner comes to Christ,
				   it is all at once taken away, and the soul is left free, it is
				   lightened of its burden, it is delivered from its bondage, and is like
				   a bird escaped from the snare of the fowler. The soul sees in Christ a
				   way to peace with God, and a way by which the law may be answered, and
				   justice satisfied, and yet he may escape; a wonderful way indeed, but
				   yet a certain and a glorious one. And what rest does it give to the
				   weary soul to see itself thus delivered, that the foundation of its
				   anxieties and fears is wholly removed, and that God's wrath ceases,
				   that it is brought into a state of peace with God, and that there is no
				   more occasion to fear hell, but that it is for ever safe! How
				   refreshing is it to the soul to be at once thus delivered of that which
				   was so much its trouble and terror, and to be eased of that which was
				   so much its burden! This is like coming to a cool shade after one has
				   been travelling in a dry and hot wilderness, and almost fainting under
				   the scorching heat. And then Christ also takes away sin itself, and
				   mortifies that root of bitterness which is the cause of all the inward
				   tumults and disquietudes that are in the mind, that make it like the
				   troubled sea that cannot rest, and leaves it all calm. When guilt is
				   taken away and sin is mortified, then the foundation of fear, and
				   trouble, and pain is removed, and the soul is left in peace and
				   serenity.
				
				   Secondly. Christ puts strength and a principle of new life into the
				   weary soul that comes to him. The sinner, before he comes to Christ, is
				   as a sick man that is weakened and brought low, and whose nature is
				   consumed by some strong distemper: he is full of pain, and so weak that
				   he cannot walk nor stand. Therefore, Christ is compared to a physician.
				   "But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole, need
				   not a physician, but they that are sick." When he comes and speaks the
				   word, he puts a principle of life into him that was before as dead: he
				   gives a principle of spiritual life and the beginning of eternal life;
				   he invigorates the mind with a communication of his own life and
				   strength, and renews the nature and creates it again, and makes the man
				   to be a new creature.
				
				   So that the fainting, sinking spirits are now revived, and this
				   principle of spiritual life is a continual spring of refreshment, like
				   a well of living water. "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
				   give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
				   be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." Christ
				   gives his Spirit, that calms the mind, and is like a refreshing breeze
				   of wind. He gives that strength whereby he lifts up the hands that hang
				   down, and strengthens the feeble knees.
				
				   Thirdly. Christ gives to those who come to him such comfort and
				   pleasure as are enough to make them forget all their former labour and
				   travail. A little of true peace, a little of the joys of the manifested
				   love of Christ, and a little of the true and holy hope of eternal life,
				   are enough to compensate for all that toil and weariness, and to erase
				   the remembrance of it from the mind. That peace which results from true
				   faith passes understanding, and that joy is joy unspeakable. There is
				   something peculiarly sweet and refreshing in this joy, that is not in
				   other joys; and what can more effectually support the mind, or give a
				   more rational ground of rejoicing, than a prospect of eternal glory in
				   the enjoyment of God from God's own promise in Christ? If we come to
				   Christ, we may not only be refreshed by resting in his shadow, but by
				   eating his fruit: these things are the fruits of this tree. "I sat down
				   under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my
				   taste."
				   Before proceeding to the next particular of this proposition, I would
				   apply myself to those that are weary; to move them to repose themselves
				   under Christ's shadow.
				
				   The great trouble of such a state, one would think, should be a motive
				   to you to accept of an offer of relief, and remedy. You are weary, and
				   doubtless would be glad to be at rest; but here you are to consider,
				
				   First. That there is no remedy but in Jesus Christ; there is nothing
				   else will give you true quietness. If you could fly into heaven, you
				   would not find it there; if you should take the wings of the morning,
				   and dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth, in some solitary place
				   in the wilderness, you could not fly from your burden. So that if you
				   do not come to Christ, you must either continue still weary and
				   burdened, or, which is worse, you must return to your old dead sleep,
				   to a state of stupidity; and not only so, but you must be everlastingly
				   wearied with God's wrath.
				
				   Second. Consider that Christ is a remedy at hand. You need not wish for
				   the wings of a dove that you may fly afar off, and be at rest, but
				   Christ is nigh at hand, if you were but sensible of it. Romans 10:6, 7,
				   8. "But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say
				   not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring
				   Christ down from above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is,
				   to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is
				   nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of
				   faith which we preach." There is no need of doing any great work to
				   come at this rest; the way is plain to it; it is but going to it, it is
				   but sitting down under Christ's shadow. Christ requires no money to
				   purchase rest of him, he calls to us to come freely, and for nothing.
				   If we are poor and have no money, we may come. Christ sent out his
				   servants to invite the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind.
				   Christ does not want to be hired to accept of you, and to give you
				   rest. It is his work as Mediator to give rest to the weary, it is the
				   work that he was anointed for, and in which he delights. "The Spirit of
				   the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach
				   good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
				   broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of
				   the prison to them that are bound."
				
				   Third. Christ is not only a remedy for your weariness and trouble, but
				   he will give you an abundance of the contrary, joy and delight. They
				   who come to Christ, do no only come to a resting-place after they have
				   been wandering in a wilderness, but they come to a banqueting-house
				   where they may rest, and where they may feast. They may cease from
				   their former troubles and toils, and they may enter upon a course of
				   delights and spiritual joys.
				
				   Christ not only delivers from fears of hell and of wrath, but he gives
				   hopes of heaven, and the enjoyment of God's love. He delivers from
				   inward tumults and inward pain from that guilt of conscience which is
				   as a worm gnawing within, and he gives delight and inward glory. He
				   brings us out of a wilderness of pits, and drought, and fiery flying
				   spirits; and he brings us into a pleasant land, a land flowing with
				   milk and honey. He delivers us out of prison, and lifts us off from the
				   dunghill, and he sets us among princes, and causes us to inherit the
				   throne of glory. Wherefore, if any one is weary, if any is in prison,
				   if any one is in captivity, if any one is in the wilderness, let him
				   come to the blessed Jesus, who is as the shadow of a great rock in a
				   weary land. Delay not, arise and come away.
				
				   2. There are quiet rest and sweet refreshment in Christ for God's
				   people that are weary.
				
				   The saints themselves, while they remain in this imperfect state, and
				   have so much remains of sin in their hearts, are liable still to many
				   troubles and sorrows, and much weariness, and have often need to resort
				   anew unto Jesus Christ for rest. I shall mention three cases wherein
				   Christ is a sufficient remedy.
				
				   First. There is rest and sweet refreshment in Christ for those that are
				   wearied with persecutions. It has been the lot of God's church in this
				   world for the most part to be persecuted. It has had now and then some
				   lucid intervals of peace and outward prosperity, but generally it has
				   been otherwise. This has accorded with the first prophecy concerning
				   Christ; "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
				   seed and her seed." Those two seeds have been at enmity ever since the
				   time of Abel. Satan has borne great malice against the church of God,
				   and so have those that are his seed. And oftentimes God's people have
				   been persecuted to an extreme degree, have been put to the most
				   exquisite torments that wit or art could devise, and thousands of them
				   have been tormented to death.
				
				   But even in such a case there are rest and refreshment to be found in
				   Christ Jesus. When their cruel enemies have given them no rest in this
				   world; when, as oftentimes has been the case, they could not flee, nor
				   in any way avoid the rage of their adversaries, but many of them have
				   been tormented gradually from day to day, that their torments might be
				   lengthened; still rest has been found even then in Christ. It has been
				   often found by experience; the martyrs have often showed plainly that
				   the peace and calm of their minds were undisturbed in the midst of the
				   greatest bodily torment, and have sometimes rejoiced and sung praises
				   upon the rack and in the fire. If Christ is pleased to send forth his
				   Spirit to manifest his love, and speaks friendly to the soul, it will
				   support it even in the greatest outward torment that man can inflict.
				   Christ is the joy of the soul, and if the soul be but rejoiced and
				   filled with divine light, such joy no man can take away; whatever
				   outward misery there be, the spirit will sustain it.
				
				   Secondly. There is in Christ rest for God's people, when exercised with
				   afflictions. If a person labour under great bodily weakness, or under
				   some disease that causes frequent and strong pains, such things will
				   tire out so feeble a creature as man. It may to such an one be a
				   comfort and an effectual support to think, that he has a Mediator, who
				   knows by experience what pain is; who by his pain has purchased eternal
				   ease and pleasure for him; and who will make his brief sufferings to
				   work out a far more exceeding delight, to be bestowed when he shall
				   rest from his labours and sorrows.
				
				   If a person be brought into great straits as to outward subsistence,
				   and poverty brings abundance of difficulties and extremities; yet it
				   may be a supporting, refreshing consideration to such an one to think,
				   that he has a compassionate Savior, who when upon earth, was so poor
				   that he had not where to lay his head, and who became poor to make him
				   rich, and purchased for him durable riches, and will make his poverty
				   work out an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
				
				   If God in his providence calls his people to mourn over lost relations,
				   and if he repeats his stroke and takes away one after another of those
				   that were dear to him; it is a supporting, refreshing consideration to
				   think, that Christ has declared that he will be in stead of all
				   relations unto those who trust in him. They are as his mother, and
				   sister, and brother; he has taken them into a very near relation to
				   himself: and in every other afflictive providence, it is a great
				   comfort to a believing soul to think that he has an intercessor with
				   God, that by him he can have access with confidence to the throne of
				   grace, and that in Christ we have so many great and precious promises,
				   that all things shall work together for good, and shall issue in
				   eternal blessedness. God's people, whenever they are scorched by
				   afflictions as by hot sun-beams, may resort to him, who is as a shadow
				   of a great rock, and be effectually sheltered, and sweetly refreshed.
				
				   Thirdly. There is in Christ quiet rest and sweet refreshment for God's
				   people, when wearied with the buffetings of Satan. The devil, that
				   malicious enemy of God and man, does whatever lies in his power to
				   darken and hinder, and tempt God's people, and render their lives
				   uncomfortable. Often he raises needless and groundless scruples, and
				   casts in doubts, and fills the mind with such fear as is tormenting,
				   and tends to hinder them exceedingly in the christian course; and he
				   often raises mists and clouds of darkness, and stirs up corruption, and
				   thereby fills the mind with concern and anguish, and sometimes wearies
				   out the soul. So that they may say as the psalmist; "Many bulls have
				   compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. They gaped
				   upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion."
				
				   In such a case if the soul flies to Jesus Christ, they may find rest in
				   him, for he came into the world to destroy Satan, and to rescue souls
				   out of his hands. And he has all things put under his feet, whether
				   they be things in heaven, or things on earth, or things in hell, and
				   therefore he can restrain Satan when he pleases. And that he is
				   doubtless ready enough to pity us under such temptations, we may be
				   assured, for he has been tempted and buffeted by Satan as well as we.
				   He is able to succour those that are tempted, and he has promised that
				   the will subdue Satan under his people's feet. Let God's people
				   therefore, when they are exercised with any of those kinds of
				   weariness, make their resort unto Jesus Christ for refuge and rest.
				
				   REFLECTIONS
				
				   1. We may here see great reason to admire the goodness and grace of God
				   to us in our low estate, that he has so provided for our help and
				   relief. We are by our own sin against God plunged into all sort of
				   evil, and God has provided a remedy for us against every sort of evil,
				   he has left us helpless in no calamity. We by our sin have exposed
				   ourselves to wrath, to a vindictive justice; but God has done very
				   great things that we might be saved from that wrath; he has been at
				   infinite cost that the law might be answered without our suffering. We
				   by our sins have exposed ourselves to terror of conscience, in
				   expectation of the dreadful storm of God's wrath; but God has provided
				   for us a hiding-place from the storm, he bids us enter into his
				   chambers, and hide ourselves from indignation. We by sin have made
				   ourselves poor, needy creatures; but God has provided for us gold tried
				   in the fire. We by sin have made ourselves naked; and when he passed
				   by, he took notice of our want, and has provided us white raiment that
				   we may be clothed. We have made ourselves blind, and God in mercy to us
				   has provided eye-salve, that we may see. We have deprived ourselves of
				   all spiritual food; we are like the prodigal son that perished with
				   hunger, and would gladly have filled his belly with husks. God has
				   taken notice of this our condition, and has provided for us a feast of
				   fat things, and has sent forth his servants to invite the poor, the
				   maimed, the halt, and the blind. We by sin have brought ourselves into
				   a dry and thirsty wilderness; but God was merciful, and took notice of
				   our condition, and has provided for us rivers of water, water out of
				   the rock. We by sin have brought upon ourselves a miserable slavery and
				   bondage; God has made provision for our liberty. We have exposed
				   ourselves to weariness; God has provided a resting-place for us. We by
				   sin have exposed ourselves to many outward troubles and afflictions;
				   God has pitied us, and in Christ has provided true comfort for us. We
				   have exposed ourselves to our grand enemy, even Satan, to be tempted
				   and buffeted by him; God has pitied, and has provided for us a Savior
				   and Captain of salvation, who has overcome Satan, and is able to
				   deliver us. Thus God has in Christ provided sufficiently for our help
				   in all kinds of evils.
				
				   How ought we to bless God for this abundant provision he has made for
				   us, poor and sinful as we were, who were so undeserving and so
				   ungrateful. He made no such provision for the fallen angels, who are
				   left without remedy in all the woes and miseries into which they are
				   plunged.
				
				   2. We should admire the love of Christ to men, that he has thus given
				   himself to be the remedy for all their evil, and a fountain of all
				   good. Christ has given himself to us, to be all things to us that we
				   need. We want clothing, and Christ does not only give us clothing, but
				   he gives himself to be our clothing, that we might put him on.
				   Galatians 3:27. "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ
				   have put on Christ." Romans 13:14. "But put ye on the Lord Jesus
				   Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
				   thereof."
				
				   We want food, and Christ has given himself to be our food; he has given
				   his own flesh to be our meat, and his blood to be our drink, to nourish
				   our soul. Thus Christ tells us that he is the bread which came down
				   from heaven, and the bread of life. "I am that bread of life. Your
				   fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the
				   bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and
				   not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
				   eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will
				   give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." In
				   order to our eating of his flesh, it was necessary that he should be
				   slain, as the sacrifices must be slain before they could be eaten; and
				   such was Christ's love to us, that he consented to be slain, he went as
				   a sheep to the slaughter, that he might give us his flesh to be food
				   for our poor, famishing souls.
				
				   We are in need of a habitation; we by sin have, as it were, turned
				   ourselves out of house and home; Christ has given himself to be the
				   habitation of his people. Psalm 90:1. "Lord, thou has been our
				   dwelling-place in all generations." It is promised to God's people that
				   they should dwell in the temple of God for ever, and should go no more
				   out; and we are told that Christ is the temple of the new Jerusalem.
				
				   Christ gives himself to his people to be all things to them that they
				   need, and all things that make for their happiness. Colossians 3:11.
				   "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,
				   barbarian, Scythian, bond, nor free; but Christ is all, and in all."
				   And that he might be so, he has refused nothing that is needful to
				   prepare him to be so.
				
				   When it was needful that he should be incarnate, he refused it not, but
				   became man, and appeared in the form of a servant. When it was needful
				   that he should be slain, he refused it not, but gave himself for us,
				   and gave himself to us upon the cross.
				
				   Here is love for us to admire, for us to praise, and for us to rejoice
				   in, with joy that is full of glory for ever.

				PARDON FOR THE GREATEST SINNERS
				
				   Psalm 25:11 -- For thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon my iniquity; for it
				   is great.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   IT is evident by some passages in this psalm, that when it was penned,
				   it was a time of affliction and danger with David. This appears
				   particularly by the 15th and following verses: "Mine eyes are ever
				   towards the Lord; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net," etc. His
				   distress makes him think of his sins, and leads him to confess them,
				   and to cry to God for pardon, as is suitable in a time of affliction.
				   See ver. 7. "Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions;"
				   and verse 18. "Look upon mine affliction, and my pain, and forgive all
				   my sins."
				
				   It is observable in the text, what arguments the psalmist makes use of
				   in pleading for pardon.
				
				   1. He pleads for pardon for God's name's sake. He has no expectation of
				   pardon for the sake of any righteousness or worthiness of his for any
				   good deeds he had done, or any compensation he had made for his sins;
				   though if man's righteousness could be a just plea, David would have
				   had as much to plead as most. But he begs that God would do it for his
				   own name's sake, for his own glory, for the glory of his own free
				   grace, and for the honour of his own covenant-faithfulness.
				
				   2. The psalmist pleads the greatness of his sins as an argument for
				   mercy. He not only doth not plead his own righteousness, or the
				   smallness of his sins; he not only cloth not say, Pardon mine iniquity,
				   for I have done much good to counterbalance it; or, Pardon mine
				   iniquity, for it is small, and thou hast no great reason to be angry
				   with me; mine iniquity is not so great, that thou hast any just cause
				   to remember it against me; mine offence is not such but that thou
				   mayest well enough overlook i': but on the contrary he says, Pardon
				   mine iniquity, for it is great; he pleads the greatness of his sin, and
				   not the smallness of it; the enforces his prayer with this
				   consideration, that his sins are very heinous.
				
				   But how could he make this a plea for pardon? I answer, Because the
				   greater his iniquity was, the more need he had of pardon. It is as much
				   as if he had said, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is so great that I
				   cannot bear the punishment; my sin is so great that I am in necessity
				   of pardon; my case will be exceedingly miserable, unless thou be
				   pleased to pardon me. He makes use of the greatness of his sin, to
				   enforce his plea for pardon, as a man would make use of the greatness
				   of calamity in begging for relief. When a beggar begs for bread, he
				   will plead the greatness of his poverty and necessity. When a man in
				   distress cries for pity, what more suitable plea can be urged than the
				   extremity of his case?--And God allows such a plea as this: for he is
				   moved to mercy towards us by nothing in us but the miserableness of our
				   case. He doth not pity sinners because they are worthy, but because
				   they need his pity.
				
				  DOCTRINE
				
				   If we truly come to God for mercy, the greatness of our sin will be no
				   impediment to pardon.--If it were an impediment, David would never have
				   used it as a plea for pardon, as we find he does in the text.--The
				   following things are needful in order that we truly come to God for
				   mercy:
				
				   I. That we should see our misery, and be sensible of our need of mercy.
				   They who are not sensible of their misery cannot truly look to God for
				   mercy; for it is the very notion of divine mercy, that it is the
				   goodness and grace of God to the miserable. Without misery in the
				   object, there can be no exercise of mercy. To suppose mercy without
				   supposing misery, or pity without calamity, is a contradiction:
				   therefore men cannot look upon themselves as proper objects of mercy,
				   unless they first know themselves to be miserable; and so, unless this
				   be the case, it is impossible that they should come to God for mercy.
				   They must be sensible that they are the children of wrath; that the law
				   is against them, and that they are exposed to the curse of it: that the
				   wrath of God abideth on them; and that he is angry' with them every day
				   while they are under the guilt of sin.--They must be sensible that it
				   is a very dreadful thing to be the object of the wrath of God; that it
				   is a very awful thing to have him for their enemy; and that they cannot
				   bear his wrath. They must he sensible that the guilt of sin makes them
				   miserable creatures, whatever temporal enjoyments they have; that they
				   can be no other than miserable, undone creatures, so long as God is
				   angry with them; that they are without strength, and must perish, and
				   that eternally, unless God help them. They must see that their case is
				   utterly desperate, for any thing that any one else can do for them;
				   that they hang over the pit of eternal misery; and that they must
				   necessarily drop into it, if God have not mercy on them.
				
				   II. They must be sensible that they are not worthy that God should have
				   mercy on them. They who truly come to God for mercy, come as beggars,
				   and not as creditors: they come for mere mercy. for sovereign grace,
				   and not for any thing that is due. Therefore, they must see that the
				   misery under which they lie is justly brought upon them, and that the
				   wrath to which they are exposed is justly threatened against them; and
				   that they have deserved that God should be their enemy, and should
				   continue to be their enemy. They must be sensible that it would be just
				   with God to do as he hath threatened in his holy law, viz. make them
				   the objects of his wrath and curse in hell to all eternity.-- They who
				   come to God for mercy in a right manner are not disposed to find fault
				   with his severity; but they come in a sense of their own utter
				   unworthiness, as with ropes about their necks, and lying in the dust at
				   the foot of mercy.
				
				   III. They must come to God for mercy in and through Jesus Christ alone.
				   All their hope of mercy must be from the consideration of what he is,
				   what he hath done, and what he hath suffered; and that there is no
				   other name given under heaven, among men, whereby we can be saved, but
				   that of Christ; that he is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the
				   world; that his blood cleanses from all sin, and that he is so worthy,
				   that all sinners who are in him may well be pardoned and accepted.--It
				   is impossible that any should come to God for mercy, and at the same
				   time have no hope of mercy. Their coming to God for it, implies that
				   they have some hope of obtaining, otherwise they would not think it
				   worth the while to come. But they that come in a right manner have all
				   their hope through Christ, or from the consideration of his redemption,
				   and the sufficiency of it.--If persons thus come to God for mercy, the
				   greatness of their sins will be no impediment to pardon. Let their sins
				   be ever so many, and great, and aggravated, it will not make God in the
				   least degree more backward to pardon them. This may be made evident by
				   the following considerations:
				
				   1. The mercy of God is as sufficient for the pardon of the greatest
				   sins, as for the least; and that because his mercy is infinite. That
				   which is infinite, is as much above what is great, as it is above what
				   is small. Thus God being infinitely great, he is as much above kings as
				   he is above beggars; he is as much above the highest angel, as he is
				   above the meanest worm. One finite measure doth not come any nearer to
				   the extent of what is infinite than another.--So the mercy of God being
				   infinite, it must be as sufficient for the pardon of all sin, as of
				   one. If one of the least sins be not beyond the mercy of God, so
				   neither are the greatest, or ten thousand of them.--However, it must be
				   acknowledged, that this alone doth not prove the doctrine. For though
				   the mercy of God may be as sufficient for the pardon of great sins as
				   others; yet there may be other obstacles, besides the want of mercy.
				   The mercy of God may be sufficient, and yet the other attributes may
				   oppose the dispensation of mercy in these cases.-- Therefore I observe,
				
				   2. That the satisfaction of Christ is as sufficient for the removal of
				   the greatest guilt, as the least: 1 John i. 7. " The blood of Christ
				   cleanseth from all sin." Acts xiii. 39. " By him all that believe are
				   justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the
				   law of Moses." All the sins of those who truly come to God for mercy,
				   let them be what they will, are satisfied for, if God be true who tells
				   us so; and if they be satisfied for, surely it is not incredible, that
				   God should be ready to pardon them. So that Christ having fully
				   satisfied for all sin, or having wrought out a satisfaction that is
				   sufficient for all, it is now no way inconsistent with the glory of the
				   divine attributes to pardon the greatest sins of those who in a right
				   manner come unto him for it. God may now pardon the greatest sinners
				   without any prejudice to the honour of his holiness. The holiness of
				   God will not suffer him to give the least countenance to sin, but
				   inclines him to give proper testimonies of his hatred of it. But Christ
				   having satisfied for sin, God can now love the sinner, and give no
				   countenance at all to sin, however great a sinner he may have been. It
				   was a sufficient testimony of God's abhorrence of sin, that he poured
				   out his wrath on his own dear Son, when he took the guilt of it upon
				   himself. Nothing can more show God's abhorrence of sin than this. If
				   all mankind had been eternally damned, it would not have been so great
				   a testimony of it.
				
				   God may, through Christ, pardon the greatest sinner without any
				   prejudice to the honour of his majesty. The honour of the divine
				   majesty indeed requires satisfaction; but the sufferings of Christ
				   fully repair the injury. Let the contempt be ever so great, yet if so
				   honourable a person as Christ undertakes to be a Mediator for the
				   offender, and suffers so much for him, it fully repairs the injury done
				   to the Majesty of heaven and earth. The sufferings of Christ fully
				   satisfy justice. The justice of God, as the supreme Govemor and Judge
				   of the world, requires the punishment of sin. The supreme Judge must
				   judge the world according to a rule of justice. God doth not show mercy
				   as a judge, but as a sovereign; therefore his exercise of mercy as a
				   sovereign, and his justice as a judge, must be made consistent one with
				   another; and this is done by the sufferings of Christ, in which sin is
				   punished fully, and justice answered. Rom. iii. 25, 26. " Whom God hath
				   set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare
				   his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
				   forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness;
				   that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
				   Jesus."--The law is no impediment in the way of the pardon of the
				   greatest sin, if men do but truly come to God for mercy: for Christ
				   hath fulfilled the law, he hath borne the curse of it, in his
				   sufferings; Gal. iii. 13. " Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of
				   the law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every
				   one that hangeth on a tree."
				
				   3. Christ will no! refuse to save the greatest sinners, who in a right
				   manner come to God for mercy; for this is his work. It is his business
				   to be a Saviour of sinners; it is the work upon which he came into the
				   world; and therefore he will not object to it. He did not come to call
				   the righteous, but sinners to repentance, Matt. ix. 13. Sin is the very
				   evil which he came into the world to remedy: therefore he will not
				   object to any man that he is very sinful. The more sinful he is, the
				   more need of Christ.--The sinfulness of man was the reason of Christ's
				   coming into the world; this is the very misery from which he came to
				   deliver men. The more they have of it, the more need they have of being
				   delivered; " They that are whole need not a physician, but they that
				   are sick," Matt. ix. 12. The physician will not make it an objection
				   against healing a man who applies to him, that he stands in great need
				   of his help. If a physician of compassion comes among the sick and
				   wounded, surely he will not refuse to heal those that stand in most
				   need of healing, if he be able to heal them.
				
				   4. Herein cloth the glory of grace by the redemption of Christ much
				   consist, viz. in its sufficiency for the pardon of the greatest
				   sinners. The whole contrivance of the way of salvation is for this end,
				   to glorify the free grace of God. God had it on his heart from all
				   eternity to glorify this attribute; and therefore it is, that the
				   device of saving sinners by Christ was conceived. The greatness of
				   divine grace appears very much in this, that God by Christ saves the
				   greatest offenders. The greater the guilt of any sinner is, the more
				   glorious and wonderful is the grace manifested in his pardon: Rom.
				   4:20. " Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." The apostle,
				   when telling how great a sinner he had been, takes notice of the
				   abounding of grace in his pardon, of which his great guilt was the
				   occasion: 1 Tim. i. 13. " Who was before a blasphemer, and a
				   persecutor, and injurious. But I obtained mercy; and the grace of our
				   Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love which is in Christ
				   Jesus." The Redeemer is glorified, in that he proves sufficient to
				   redeem those who are exceeding sinful, in that his blood proves
				   sufficient to wash away the greatest guilt, in that he is able to save
				   men to the uttermost, and in that he redeems even from the greatest
				   misery. It is the honour of Christ to save the greatest sinners, when
				   they come to him, as it is the honour of a physician that he cures the
				   most desperate diseases or wounds. Therefore, no doubt, Christ will be
				   willing to save the greatest sinners, if they come to him; for he will
				   not be backward to glorify himself, and to commend the value and virtue
				   of his own blood. Seeing he hath so laid out himself to redeem sinners,
				   he will not be unwilling to show, that he is able to redeem to the
				   uttermost.
				
				   5. Pardon is as much offered and promised to the greatest sinners as
				   any, if they will come aright to God for mercy. The invitations of the
				   gospel are always in universal terms: as, Ho, every one that thirsteth;
				   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden; and, Whosoever
				   will, let him come. And the voice of Wisdom is to men in general: Prov.
				   viii. 4. " Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of
				   men." Not to moral men, or religious men, but to you, O men. So Christ
				   promises, John vi. 37. " Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
				   out." This is the direction of Christ to his apostles, after his
				   resurrection, Mark xvi. 15, 16. " Go ye into all the world, and preach
				   the gospel to every creature: he that believeth, and is baptized, shall
				   be saved." Which is agreeable to what the apostle saith, that "the
				   gospel was preached to every creature which is under heaven," Col. i.
				   23.
				
				   APPLICATION
				
				   The proper use of this subject is, to encourage sinners whose
				   consciences are burdened with a sense of guilt, immediately to go to
				   God through Christ for mercy. If you go in the manner we have
				   described, the arms of mercy are open to embrace you. You need not be
				   at all the more fearful of coming because of your sins, let them be
				   ever so black. If you had as much guilt lying on each of your souls as
				   all the wicked men in the world, and all the damned souls in hell; yet
				   if you come to God for mercy, sensible of your own vileness, and
				   seeking pardon only through the free mercy of God in Christ, you would
				   not need to be afraid; the greatness of your sins would be no
				   impediment to your pardon. Therefore, if your souls be burdened, and
				   you are distressed for fear of hell, you need not bear that burden and
				   distress any longer. If you are but willing, you may freely come and
				   unload yourselves, and cast all your burdens on Christ, and rest in
				   him.
				
				   But here I shall speak to some OBJECTIONS which some awakened sinners
				   may be ready to make against what I now exhort them to.
				
				   I. Some may be ready to object, I have spent my youth and all the best
				   of my life in sin, and I am afraid God will not accept of me, when I
				   offer him only mine old age.--To this I would answer, 1. Hath God said
				   any where, that he will not accept of old sinners who come to him? God
				   hath often made offers and promises in universal terms; and is there
				   any such exception put in? Doth Christ say, All that thirst, let them
				   come to me and drink, except old sinners? Come to me, all ye that
				   labour and are heavy laden, except old sinners, and I will give you
				   rest? Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out, if he be not
				   an old sinner? Did you ever read any such exception any where in the
				   Bible? and why should you give way to exceptions which you make out of
				   your own heads, or rather which the devil puts into your heads, and
				   which have no foundation in the word of God?--Indeed it is more rare
				   that old sinners are willing to come, than others; but if they do come,
				   they are as readily accepted as any whatever.
				
				   2. When God accepts of young persons, it is not for the sake of the
				   service which they are like to do him afterwards, or because youth is
				   better worth accepting than old age. You seem entirely to mistake the
				   matter, in thinking that God will not accept of you because you are
				   old; as though he readily accepted of persons in their youth, because
				   their youth is better worth his acceptance; whereas it is only for the
				   sake of Jesus Christ, that God is willing to accept of any.
				
				   You say, your life is almost spent, and you are afraid that the best
				   time for serving God is past; and that therefore God will not now
				   accept of you; as if it were for the sake of the service which persons
				   are like to do him, after they are converted, that he accepts of them.
				   But a self-righteous spirit is at the bottom of such objections. Men
				   cannot get off from the notion, that it is for some goodness or service
				   of their own, either done or expected to be done, that God accepts of
				   persons, and receives them into favour.--Indeed they who deny God their
				   youth, the best part of their lives, and spend it in the service of
				   Satan, dreadfully sin and provoke God; and he very often leaves them to
				   hardness of heart when they are grown old. But if they are willing to
				   accept of Christ when old, he is as ready to receive them as any
				   others; for in that matter God hath respect only to Christ and his
				   worthiness.
				
				   II. But, says one, I fear I have committed sins that are peculiar to
				   reprobates. I have sinned against light, and strong convictions of
				   conscience; I have sinned presumptuously; and have so resisted the
				   strivings of the Spirit of God, that I am afraid I have committed such
				   sins as none of God's elect ever commit. I cannot think that God will
				   ever leave one whom he intends to save, to go on and commit sins
				   against so much light and conviction, and with such horrid
				   presumption.--Others may say, I have had risings of heart against God;
				   blasphemous thoughts, a spiteful and malicious spirit; and have abused
				   mercy and the strivings of the Spirit, trampled upon the Saviour, and
				   my sins are such as are peculiar to those who are reprobated to eternal
				   damnation. To all this I would answer,
				
				   1. There is no sin peculiar to reprobates but the sin against the Holy
				   Ghost. Do you read of any other in the word of God? And if you do not
				   read of any there, what ground have you to think any such thing? What
				   other rule have we, by which to judge of such matters, but the divine
				   word? If we venture to go beyond that, we shall be miserably in the
				   dark. When we pretend to go further in our determinations than the word
				   of God, Satan takes us up, and leads us. It seems to you that such sins
				   are peculiar to the reprobate, and such as God never forgives. But what
				   reason can you give for it, if you have no word of God to reveal it? Is
				   it because you cannot see how the mercy of God is sufficient to pardon,
				   or the blood of Christ to cleanse from such presumptuous sins? If so,
				   it is because you never yet saw how great the mercy of God is; you
				   never saw the sufficiency of the blood of Christ, and you know not how
				   far the virtue of it extends. Some elect persons have been guilty of
				   all manner of sins, except the sin against the Holy Ghost; and unless
				   you have been guilty of this, you have not been guilty of any that are
				   peculiar to reprobates.
				
				   2. Men may be less likely to believe, for sins which they have
				   committed, and not the less readily pardoned when they do believe. It
				   must be acknowledged that some sinners are in more danger of hell than
				   others. Though all are in great danger, some are less likely to be
				   saved. Some are less likely ever to be converted and to come to Christ:
				   but all who do come to him are alike readily accepted; and there is as
				   much encouragement for one man to come to Christ as another.--Such sins
				   as you mention are indeed exceeding heinous and provoking to God, and
				   do in an especial manner bring the soul into danger of damnation, and
				   into danger of being given to final hardness of heart; and God more
				   commonly gives men up to the judgment of final hardness for such sins,
				   than for others. Yet they are not peculiar to reprobates; there is but
				   one sin that is so, viz. that against the Holy Ghost. And
				   notwithstanding the sins which you have committed, if you can find it
				   in your hearts to come to Christ, and close with him, you will be
				   accepted not at all the less readily because you have committed such
				   sins.--Though God cloth more rarely cause some sorts of sinners to come
				   to Christ than others, it is not because his mercy or the redemption of
				   Christ is not as sufficient for them as others, but because in wisdom
				   he sees fit so to dispense his grace, for a restraint upon the
				   wickedness of men; and because it is his will to give converting grace
				   in the use of means, among which this is one, viz. to lead a moral and
				   religious life, and agreeable to our light, and the convictions of our
				   consciences. But when once any sinner is willing to come to Christ,
				   mercy is as ready for him as for any. There is no consideration at all
				   had of his sins; let him have been ever so sinful, his sins are not
				   remembered; God doth not upbraid him with them.
				
				   III. But had I not better stay till I shall have made myself better,
				   before I presume to come to Christ. I have been, and see myself to be
				   very wicked now; but am in hopes of mending myself, and rendering
				   myself at least not so wicked: then I shall have more courage to come
				   to God for mercy.--In answer to this,
				
				   1. Consider how unreasonably you act. You are striving to set up
				   yourselves for your own saviours; you are striving to get something of
				   your own, on the account of which you may the more readily be accepted.
				   So that by this it appears that you do not seek to be accepted only on
				   Christ's account. And is not this to rob Christ of the glory of being
				   your only Saviour? Yet this is the way in which you are hoping to make
				   Christ willing to save you.
				
				   2. You can never come to Christ at all, unless you first see that he
				   will not accept of you the more readily for any thing that you can do.
				   You must first see, that it is utterly in vain for you to try to make
				   yourselves better on any such account. You must see that you can never
				   make yourselves any more worthy, or less unworthy, by any thing which
				   you can perform.
				
				   3. If ever you truly come to Christ, you must see that there is enough
				   in him for your pardon, though you be no better than you are. If you
				   see not the sufficiency of Christ to pardon you, without any
				   righteousness of your own to recommend you, you never will come so as
				   to be accepted of him. The way to be accepted is to come--not on any
				   such encouragement, that now you have made yourselves better, and more
				   worthy, or not so unworthy, but--on the mere encouragement of Christ's
				   worthiness, and God's mercy.
				
				   4. If ever you truly come to Christ, you must come to him to make you
				   better. You must come as a patient comes to his physician, with his
				   diseases or wounds to be cured. Spread all your wickedness before him,
				   and do not plead your goodness; but plead your badness, and your
				   necessity on that account: and say, as the psalmist in the text, not
				   Pardon mine iniquity, for it is not so great as it was, but, " Pardon
				   mine iniquity, for it is Great."

				PRESSING INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD
				
				    Luke 16:16 -- The law and the prophets were until John; since that time the
				    kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				   In these words two things may be observed: First, Wherein the work and
				   office of John the Baptist consisted, viz. in preaching the kingdom of
				   God, to prepare the way for its introduction to succeed the law and the
				   prophets. By the law and the prophets, in the text, seems to be
				   intended the ancient dispensation under the Old Testament, which was
				   received from Moses and the prophets. These are said to be until John;
				   not that the revelations given by them are out of use since that time,
				   but that the state of the church, founded and regulated under God by
				   them, the dispensation of which they were the ministers, and wherein
				   the church depended mainly on light received from them, fully continued
				   till John. He first began to introduce the New Testament dispensation,
				   or gospel-state of the church; which, with its glorious, spiritual, and
				   eternal privileges and blessings, is often called the kingdom of
				   heaven, or kingdom of God. John the Baptist preached, that the kingdom
				   of God was at hand. "Repent" says he, "for the kingdom of heaven is at
				   hand:"-"Since that time," says Christ, "the kingdom of God is
				   preached." John the Baptist first began to preach it; and then, after
				   him, Christ and his disciples preached the same.
				
				   Thus Christ preached, Matthew 4:17. "From that time Jesus began to
				   preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." So
				   the disciples were directed to preach, Matthew 10:7. "And, as ye go,
				   preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand." It was not John the
				   Baptist, but Christ, that fully brought in, and actually established,
				   this kingdom of God; but he, as Christ's forerunner to prepare his way
				   before him, did the first thing that was done towards introducing it.
				   The old dispensation was abolished, and the new brought in by degrees;
				   as the night gradually ceases, and gives place to the increasing day
				   which succeeds in its room.
				
				   First the day-star arises; next follows the light of the sun itself,
				   but dimly reflected, in the dawning of the day; but this light
				   increases, and shines more and more, and the stars that served for
				   light during the foregoing night, gradually go out, and their light
				   ceases, as being now needless, till at length the sun rises, and
				   enlightens the world by his own direct light, which increases as he
				   ascends higher above the horizon, till the day-star itself gradually
				   disappears; agreeable to what John says of himself, John 3:30. "He must
				   increase, but I must decrease." John was the forerunner of Christ, and
				   harbinger of the gospel-day; much as the morning-star is the forerunner
				   of the sun. He had the most honorable office of any of the prophets;
				   the other prophets foretold Christ to come, he revealed him as already
				   come, and had the honour to be that servant who should come immediately
				   before him, and actually introduce him, and even to be the instrument
				   concerned in his solemn inauguration, as he was in baptizing him. He
				   was the greatest of the prophets that came before Christ, as the
				   morning-star is the brightest of all the stars, Matthew 11:11. He came
				   to prepare men's hearts to receive that kingdom of God which Christ was
				   about more fully to reveal and erect. Luke 1:17. "To make ready a
				   people prepared for the Lord."
				
				   Secondly, We may observe wherein his success appeared, viz. in that
				   since he began his ministry, every man pressed into that kingdom of God
				   which he preached. The greatness of his success appeared in two things:
				
				   1. In the generalness of it, with regard to the subject, or the persons
				   in whom the success appeared; every man. Here is a term of
				   universality; but it is not to be taken as universal with regard to
				   individuals, but kinds; as such universal terms are often used in
				   Scripture. When John preached, there was an extraordinary pouring out
				   of the Spirit of God that attended his preaching. An uncommon
				   awakening, and concern for salvation, appeared on the minds of all
				   sorts of persons; and even in the most unlikely persons, and those from
				   whom such a thing might least be expected; as the Pharisees, who were
				   exceeding proud, and self-sufficient, and conceited of their own wisdom
				   and righteousness, and looked on themselves fit to be teachers of
				   others, and used to scorn to be taught; and the Sadducees, who were a
				   kind of infidels, that denied any resurrection, angel, spirit, or any
				   future state. So that John himself seems to be surprised to see them
				   come to him, under such concern for their salvation; as in Matthew 3:7.
				   "But when he saw many of the Pharisees come to his baptism, he said to
				   them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the
				   wrath to come?" And besides these, the publicans, who were some of the
				   most infamous sort of men, came to him, inquiring what they should do
				   to be saved. And the soldiers, who were doubtless a very profane,
				   loose, and prolifigate sort of persons, made the same inquiry, Luke
				   3:12, and 14. "Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto
				   him, Master, what shall we do? And the soldiers likewise demanded of
				   him, saying, And what shall we do?
				
				   2. His success appeared in the manner in which his hearers sought the
				   kingdom of God; they pressed into it. It is elsewhere set forth by
				   their being violent for the kingdom of heaven, and taking it by force.
				   Matthew 11:12. "From the days of John the Baptist until now, the
				   kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."
				
				   The Doctrine that I observe from the words is this,- "It concerns every
				   one that would obtain the kingdom of God, to be pressing into it." -In
				   discoursing of this subject, I would,
				
				   First, Show what is that way of seeking salvation that seems to be
				   pointed forth in the expression of pressing into the kingdom of God.
				
				   Secondly, Give the reasons why it concerns every one that would obtain
				   the kingdom of God, to seek it in this way.- And then make application.
				
				   I. I would show what manner of seeking salvation seems to be denoted by
				   "pressing into the kingdom of God."
				
				   1. This expression denotes strength of desire. Men in general who live
				   under the light of the gospel, and are not atheists, desire the kingdom
				   of God; that is, they desire to go to heaven rather than to hell. Most
				   of them indeed are not much concerned about it; but on the contrary,
				   live a secure and careless life. And some who are many degrees above
				   these, being under some degrees of the awakenings of God's Spirit, yet
				   are not pressing into the kingdom of God. But they that may be said to
				   be truly so, have strong desires to get out of a natural condition, and
				   to get an interest in Christ. They have such a conviction of the misery
				   of their present state, and of the extreme necessity of obtaining a
				   better, that their minds are as it were possessed with and wrapped up
				   in concern about it.
				
				   To obtain salvation is desired by them above all things in the world.
				   This concern is so great that it very much shuts out other concerns.
				   They used before to have the stream of their desires after other
				   things, or, it may be, had their concern divided between this and them;
				   but when they come to answer the expression of the text, of pressing
				   into the kingdom of God, this concern prevails above all others; it
				   lays other things low, and does in a manner engross the care of the
				   mind. This seeking eternal life should not only be one concern that our
				   souls are taken up about with other things; but salvation should be
				   sought as the one thing needful, Luke 10:42. And as the one thing that
				   is desired, Psalm 27:4.
				
				   2. Pressing into the kingdom of heaven denotes earnestness and firmness
				   of resolution. There should be strength of resolution, accompanying
				   strength of desire, as it was in the psalmist, in the place just now
				   referred to: "one thing have I desired, and that will I seek after." In
				   order to a thorough engagedness of the mind in this affair, both these
				   must meet together. Besides desires after salvation, there should be an
				   earnest resolution in persons to pursue this good as much as lies in
				   their power; to do all that in the use of their utmost strength they
				   are able to do, in an attendance on every duty, and resisting and
				   militating against all manner of sin, and to continue in such a
				   pursuit.
				
				   There are two things needful in a person, in order to these strong
				   resolutions; there must be a sense of the great importance and
				   necessity of the mercy sought, and there must also be a sense of
				   opportunity to obtain it, or the encouragement there is to seek it. The
				   strength of resolution depends on the sense which God gives to the
				   heart of these things. Persons without such a sense, may seem to
				   themselves to take up resolutions; they may, as it were, force a
				   promise to themselves, and say within themselves, "I will seek as long
				   as I live, I will not give up till I obtain," when they do but deceive
				   themselves. Their hearts are not in it; neither do they indeed take up
				   any such resolution as they seem to themselves to do. It is the
				   resolution of the mouth more than of the heart; their hearts are not
				   strongly bent to fulfill what their mouth says. The firmness of the
				   resolution lies in the fulness of the disposition of the heart to do
				   what is resolved to be done. Those who are pressing into the kingdom of
				   God, have a disposition of heart to do everything that is required, and
				   that lies in their power to do, and to continue in it. They have not
				   only earnestness, but steadiness of resolution: they do not seek with a
				   wavering unsteady heart, by turns or fits, being off and on; but it is
				   the constant bent of the soul, if possible, to obtain the kingdom of
				   God.
				
				   3. By pressing into the kingdom of God is signified greatness of
				   endeavor. It is expressed in Ecclesiastes 10:10. by doing what our hand
				   finds to do with our might. And this is the natural and necessary
				   consequence of the two forementioned things. Where there is strength of
				   desire, and firmness of resolution, there will be answerable endeavors.
				   Persons thus engaged in their hearts will "strive to enter in at the
				   strait gate," and will be violent for heaven; their practice will be
				   agreeable to the counsel of the wise man, in Proverbs 2 at the
				   beginning, "My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
				   commandments with thee; so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and
				   apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after
				   knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest
				   her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt
				   thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God."
				   Here the earnestness of desire and strength of resolution is signified
				   by inclining the ear to wisdom, and applying the heart to
				   understanding; and the greatness of endeavor is denoted by crying after
				   knowledge, and lifting up the voice for understanding; seeking her as
				   silver, and searching for her as for hid treasures: such desires and
				   resolutions, and such endeavors go together.
				
				   4. Pressing into the kingdom of God denotes an engagedness and
				   earnestness, that is directly about that business of getting into the
				   kingdom of God. Persons may be in very great exercise and distress of
				   mind, and that about the condition of their souls; their thoughts and
				   cares may be greatly engaged and taken up about things of a spiritual
				   nature, and yet not be pressing into the kingdom of God, nor towards
				   it. The exercise of their minds is not directly about the work of
				   seeking salvation, in a diligent attendance on the means that God hath
				   appointed in order to it, but something else that is beside their
				   business; it may be God's decrees and secret purposes, prying into
				   them, searching for signs whereby they may determine, or at least
				   conjecture, what they are before God makes them known by their
				   accomplishment. They distress their minds with fears that they be not
				   elected, or that they have committed the unpardonable sin, or that
				   their day is past, and that God has given them up to judicial and final
				   hardness, and never intends to show them mercy; and therefore, that it
				   is in vain for them to seek salvation. Or they entangle themselves
				   about the doctrine of original sin, and other mysterious doctrines of
				   religion that are above their comprehension.
				
				   Many persons that seem to be in great distress about a future eternal
				   state, get much into a way of perplexing themselves with such things as
				   these. When it is so, let them be never so much concerned and engaged
				   in their minds, they cannot be said to be pressing towards the kingdom
				   of God: because their exercise is not in their work, but rather that
				   which tends to hinder them in their work. If they are violent, they are
				   only working violently to entangle themselves, and lay blocks in their
				   own way; their pressure is not forwards. Instead of getting along, they
				   do but lose their time, and worse than merely lose it; instead of
				   fighting with the giants that stand in the way to keep them out of
				   Canaan, they spend away their time and strength in conflicting with
				   shadows that appear by the wayside.
				
				   Hence we are not to judge of the hopefulness of the way that persons
				   are in, or of the probability of their success in seeking salvation,
				   only by the greatness of the concern and distress that they are in; for
				   many persons have needless distresses that they had much better be
				   without. It is thus very often with persons overrun with the distemper
				   of melancholy: whence the adversary of souls is wont to take great
				   advantage. But then are persons in the most likely way to obtain the
				   kingdom of heaven, when the intent of their minds, and the engagedness
				   of their spirits, be about their proper work and business, and all the
				   bent of their souls is to attend on God's means, and to do what he
				   commands and directs them to. The apostle tells us, I Corinthians 9:26.
				   "that he did not fight as those that beat the air." Our time is short
				   enough; we had not need to spend it in that which is nothing to the
				   purpose. There are real difficulties and enemies enough for persons to
				   encounter, to employ all their strength; they had not need to waste it
				   in fighting with phantoms.
				
				   5. By pressing into the kingdom of God is denoted a breaking through
				   opposition and difficulties. There is in the expression a plain
				   intimation of difficulty. If there were no opposition, but the way was
				   all clear and open, there would be no need of pressing to get along.
				   They therefore that are pressing into the kingdom of God, go on with
				   such engagedness, that they break through the difficulties that are in
				   the way. They are so set for salvation, that those things by which
				   others are discouraged, and stopped, and turned back, do not stop them,
				   but they press through them. Persons ought to be so resolved for
				   heaven, that if by any means they can obtain, they will obtain. Whether
				   those means be difficult or easy, cross or agreeable, if they are
				   requisite means of salvation, they should be complied with. When
				   anything is presented to be done, the question should not be, Is it
				   easy or hard? is it agreeable to my carnal inclinations or interest, or
				   against them? But is it a required means of my obtaining an interest in
				   Jesus Christ, and eternal salvation? Thus the apostle, Philippians
				   3:11. "If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the
				   dead." He tells us there in the context what difficulties he broke
				   through, that he suffered the loss of all things, and was willingly
				   made conformable even to Christ's death, though that was attended with
				   such extreme torment and ignominy.
				
				   He that is pressing into the kingdom of God, commonly finds many things
				   in the way that are against the grain; but he is not stopped by the
				   cross that lies before him, but takes it up, and carries it. Suppose
				   there be something incumbent on him to do, that is cross to his natural
				   temper, and irksome to him on that account; suppose something that he
				   cannot do without suffering in his estate, or that he apprehends will
				   look odd and strange in the eyes of others, and expose him to ridicule
				   and reproach, or any thing that will offend a neighbor, and get his
				   ill-will, or something that will be very cross to his own carnal
				   appetite-he will press through such difficulties. Everything that is
				   found to be a weight that hinders him in running this race he casts
				   from him, though it be a weight of gold or pearls; yea, if it be a
				   right hand or foot that offends him, he will cut them off, and will not
				   stick at plucking out a right eye with his own hands. These things are
				   insuperable difficulties to those who are not thoroughly engaged in
				   seeking their salvation; they are stumbling-blocks that they never get
				   over. But it is not so with him that presses into the kingdom of God.
				   Those things (before he was thoroughly roused from his security) about
				   which he was wont to have long parleyings and disputings with his own
				   conscience-employing carnal reason to invent arguments and pleas of
				   excuse-he now sticks at no longer; he has done with this endless
				   disputing and reasoning, and presses violently through all
				   difficulties.
				
				   Let what will be in the way, heaven is what he must and will obtain,
				   not if he can without difficulty, but if it be possible. He meets with
				   temptation: the devil is often whispering in his ear, setting
				   allurements before him, magnifying the difficulties of the work he is
				   engaged in, telling him that they are insuperable, and that he can
				   never conquer them, and trying all ways in the world to discourage him;
				   but still he presses forward. God has given and maintains such an
				   earnest spirit for heaven, that the devil cannot stop him in his
				   course; he is not at leasure to lend an ear to what he has to say.-I
				   come now,
				    1. To show why the kingdom of heaven should be sought in this
				       manner.-It should be thus sought,
				
				   1. On account of the extreme necessity we are in of getting into the
				   kingdom of heaven. We are in a perishing necessity of it; without it we
				   are utterly and eternally lost. Out of the kingdom of God is no safety;
				   there is no other hiding-place; this is the only city of refuge, in
				   which we can be secure from the avenger that pursues all the ungodly.
				   The vengeance of God will pursue, overtake, and eternally destroy, them
				   that are not in this kingdom. All that are without this enclosure will
				   be swallowed up in an overflowing fiery deluge of wrath. They may stand
				   at the door and knock, and cry, Lord, Lord, open to us, in vain; they
				   will be thrust back; and God will have no mercy on them; they shall be
				   eternally left of him. His fearful vengence will seize them; the devils
				   will lay hold of them; and all evil will come upon them; and there will
				   be none to pity or help; their case will be utterly desperate, and
				   infinitely doleful. It will be a gone case with them; all offers of
				   mercy and expressions of divine goodness will be finally withdrawn, and
				   all hope will be lost. God will have no kind of regard to their
				   well-being; will take no care of them to save them from any enemy, or
				   any evil; but himself will be their dreadful enemy, and will execute
				   wrath with fury, and will take vengeance in an inexpressibly dreadful
				   manner. Such as shall be in this case will be lost and undone indeed!
				   They will be sunk down into perdition, infinitely below all that we can
				   think. For who knows the power of God's anger? And who knows the misery
				   of that poor worm, on whom that anger is executed without mercy?
				
				   2. On account of the shortness and uncertainty of the opportunity for
				   getting into this kingdom. When a few days are past, all our
				   opportunity for it will be gone. Our day is limited. God has set our
				   bounds, and we know not where. While persons are out of this kingdom,
				   they are in danger every hour of being overtaken with wrath. We know
				   not how soon we shall get past that line, beyond which there is no
				   work, device, knowledge, nor wisdom; and therefore we should do what we
				   have to do with our might, Ecclesiastes 9:10.
				
				   3. On account of the difficulty of getting into the kingdom of God.
				   There are innumerable difficulties in the way; such as few conquer:
				   most of them that try have not resolution, courage, earnestness, and
				   constancy enough; but they fail, give up, and perish. The difficulties
				   are too many and too great for them that do not violently press
				   forward. They never get along, but stick by the way; are turned aside,
				   or turned back, and ruined. Matthew 7:14. "Strait is the gate, and
				   narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find
				   it." Luke 13:24. "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I
				   say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
				
				   4. The possibility of obtaining. Though it be attended with so much
				   difficulty, yet it is not a thing impossible. Acts 8:22. "If perhaps
				   the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee." II Timothy 2:25. "If
				   peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
				   truth." However sinful a person is, and whatever his circumstances are,
				   there is, notwithstanding, a possibility of his salvation. He himself
				   is capable of it, and God is able to accomplish it, and has mercy
				   sufficient for it; and there is sufficient provision made through
				   Christ, that God may do it consistent with the honour of his majesty,
				   justice, and truth. So that there is no want either of sufficiency in
				   God, or capacity in the sinner, in order to this. The greatest and
				   vilest most blind, dead, hard-hearted sinner living, is a subject
				   capable of saving light and grace. Seeing therefore there is such a
				   necessity of obtaining the kingdom of God, and so short a time, and
				   such difficulty, and yet such a possibility, it may well induce us to
				   press into it. Jonah 3:8, 9.
				
				   5. It is meet that the kingdom of heaven should be thus sought, because
				   of the great excellency of it. We are willing to seek earthly things,
				   of trifling value, with great diligence, and through much difficulty;
				   it therefore certainly becomes us to seek that with great earnestness
				   which is of infinitely greater worth and excellence. And how well may
				   God expect and require it of us, that we should seek it in such a
				   manner, in order to our obtaining it!
				
				   6. Such a manner of seeking is needful to prepare persons for the
				   kingdom of God. Such earnestness and thoroughness of endeavors, is the
				   ordinary means that God makes use of to bring persons to an
				   acquaintance with themselves, to a sight of their own hearts, to a
				   sense of their own helplessness, and to a despair in their own strength
				   and righteousness. And such engagedness and constancy in seeking the
				   kingdom of heaven, prepare the soul to receive it the more joyfully and
				   thankfully, and the more highly to prize and value it when obtained. So
				   that it is in mercy to us, as well as for the glory of his own name,
				   that God has appointed such earnest seeking, to be the way in which he
				   will bestow the kingdom of heaven.
				
				  APPLICATION
				
				   The use I would make of this doctrine, is of exhortation to all
				   Christless persons to press into the kingdom of God. Some of you are
				   inquiring what you shall do? You seem to desire to know what is the way
				   wherein salvation is to be sought, and how you may be likely to obtain
				   it. You have now heard the way that the holy word of God directs to.
				   Some are seeking, but it cannot be said of them that they are pressing
				   into the kingdom of heaven. There are many that in time past have
				   sought salvation, but not in this manner, and so they never obtained,
				   but are now gone to hell. Some of them sought it year after year, but
				   failed of it, and perished at last. They were overtaken with divine
				   wrath, and are now suffering the fearful misery of damnation, and have
				   no rest day nor night, having no more opportunity to seek, but must
				   suffer and be miserable throughout the never-ending ages of eternity.
				   Be exhorted, therefore, not to seek salvation as they did, but let the
				   kingdom of heaven suffer violence from you.
				
				   Here I would first answer an objection or two, and then proceed to give
				   some directions how to press into the kingdom of God.
				
				   Objection. 1. Some may be ready to say, We cannot do this of ourselves;
				   that strength of desire, and firmness of resolution, that have been
				   spoken of, are out of our reach. If I endeavor to resolve and to seek
				   with engagedness of spirit, I find I fail; my thoughts are presently
				   off from the business, and I feel myself dull, and my engagedness
				   relaxed, in spite of all I can do.
				
				   Answer. 1. Though earnestness of mind be not immediately in your power,
				   yet the consideration of what has been now said of the need of it, may
				   be a means of stirring you up to it. It is true, persons never will be
				   thoroughly engaged in this business, unless it be by God's influence;
				   but God influences persons by means. Persons are not stirred up to a
				   thorough earnestness without some considerations that move them to it.
				   And if persons can but be made sensible of the necessity of salvation,
				   and also duly consider the exceeding difficuly of it, and the greatness
				   of the opposition, and how short and uncertain the time is, but yet are
				   sensible that they have an opportunity, and that there is a possibility
				   of their obtaining, they will need no more in order to their being
				   thoroughly engaged and resolved in this matter. If we see persons slack
				   and unresolved, and unsteady, it is because they do not enough consider
				   these things.
				
				   2. Though strong desires and resolutions of mind be not in your power,
				   yet painfulness of endeavors is in your power. It is in your power to
				   take pains in the use of means, yea very great pains. You can be very
				   painful and diligent in watching your own heart, and striving against
				   sin. Though there is all manner of corruption in the heart continually
				   ready to work, yet you can very laboriously watch and strive against
				   these corruptions; and it is in your power, with great diligence to
				   attend the matter of your duty towards God and towards your neighbour.
				   It is in your power to attend all ordinances, and all public and
				   private duties of religion, and to do it with your might. It would be a
				   contradiction to suppose that a man cannot do these things with all the
				   might he has, though he cannot do them with more might than he has. The
				   dullness and deadness of the heart, and slothfulness of disposition, do
				   not hinder men being able to take pains, though it hinders their being
				   willing. That is one thing wherein your laboriousness may appear, even
				   striving against your own dullness. That men have a dead and sluggish
				   heart, does not argue that they be not able to take pains; it is so far
				   from that, that it gives occasion for pains. It is one of the
				   difficulties in the way of duty, that persons have to strive with, and
				   that gives occasion for struggling and labour. If there were no
				   difficulties attended seeking salvation, there would be no occasion for
				   striving; a man would have nothing to strive about. There is indeed a
				   great deal of difficulty attending all duties required of those that
				   would obtain heaven. It is an exceeding difficult thing for them to
				   keep their thoughts; it is a difficult thing seriously, or to any good
				   purpose, to consider matters of greatest importance; it is a difficult
				   thing to hear, or read, or pray attentively. But it does not argue that
				   a man cannot strive in these things because they are difficult; nay, he
				   could not strive therein if there were not difficulty in them. For what
				   is there excepting difficulties that any can have to strive or struggle
				   with in any affair or business? Earnestness of mind, and diligence of
				   endeavor, tend to promote each other. He that has a heart earnestly
				   engaged, will take pains; and he that is diligent and painful in all
				   duty, probably will not be so long before he finds the sensibleness of
				   his heart and earnestness of his spirit greatly increased.
				
				   Objection 2. Some may object, that if they are earnest, and take a
				   great deal of pains, they shall be in danger of trusting to what they
				   do; they are afraid of doing their duty for fear of making a
				   righteousness of it.
				
				   Answer. There is ordinarily no kind of seekers that trust so much to
				   what they do, as slack and dull seekers. Though all seeking salvation,
				   that have never been the subjects of a thorough humiliation, do trust
				   in their own righteousness; yet some do it much more fully than others.
				   Some though they trust in their own righteousness, yet are not quiet in
				   it. And those who are most disturbed in their self-confidence, (and
				   therefore in the likeliest way to be wholly brought off from it,) are
				   not such as go on in a remiss way of seeking, but such as are most
				   earnest and thoroughly engaged; partly because in such a way conscience
				   is kept more sensible. A more awakened conscience will not rest so
				   quietly in moral and religious duties, as one that is less awakened. A
				   dull seeker's conscience will be in a great measure satisfied and
				   quieted with his own works and performances; but one that is thoroughly
				   awakened cannot be stilled or pacified with such things as these. In
				   this way persons gain much more knowledge of themselves, and
				   acquaintance with their own hearts, than in a negligent, slight way of
				   seeking; for they have a great deal more experience of themselves. It
				   is experience of ourselves, and finding what we are, that God commonly
				   makes use of as the means of bringing us off from all dependence on
				   ourselves. But men never get acquaintance with themselves so fast, as
				   in the most earnest way of seeking. They that are in this way have more
				   to engage them to think of their sins, and strictly to observe
				   themselves, and have much more to do with their own hearts, than
				   others. Such a one has much more experience of his own weakness, than
				   another that does not put forth and try his strength; and will
				   therefore sooner see himself dead in sin. Such a one, though he hath a
				   disposition continually to be flying to his own righteousness, yet
				   finds rest in nothing; he wanders about from one thing to another,
				   seeking something to ease his disquieted conscience; he is driven from
				   one refuge to another, goes from mountain to hill, seeking rest and
				   finding none; and therefore will the sooner prove that there is no rest
				   to be found, nor trust to be put, in any creature whatsoever.
				
				   It is therefore quite a wrong notion that some entertain, that the more
				   they do, the more they shall depend on it. Whereas the reverse is true;
				   the more they do, or the more thorough they are in seeking, the less
				   will they be likely to rest in their doings, and the sooner will they
				   see the vanity of all that they do. So that persons will exceedingly
				   miss it, if ever they neglect to do any duty either to God or man,
				   whether it be any duty of religion, justice, or charity, under a notion
				   of its exposing them to trust in their own righteousness. It is very
				   true, that it is a common thing for persons, when they earnestly seek
				   salvation, to trust in the pains that they take: but yet commonly those
				   that go on in a more slight way, trust a great deal more securely to
				   their dull services, than he that is pressing into the kingdom of God
				   does to his earnestness. Men's slackness in religion, and their trust
				   in their own righteousness, strengthen and establish one another. Their
				   trust in what they have done, and what they now do, settles them in a
				   slothful rest and ease, and hinders their being sensible of their need
				   of rousing up themselves and pressing forward. And on the other hand,
				   their negligence tends so to benumb them in such ignorance of
				   themselves, that the most miserable refuges are stupidly rested in as
				   sufficient. Therefore we see, that when persons have been going on for
				   a long time in such a way, and God afterwards comes more thoroughly to
				   awaken them, and to stir them up to be in good earnest, he shakes all
				   their old foundations, and rouses them out of their old resting places;
				   so that they cannot quiet themselves with those things that formerly
				   kept them secure. I would now proceed to give some directions how you
				   should press into the kingdom of God.
				
				   1. Be directed to sacrifice every thing to your soul's eternal
				   interest. Let seeking this be so much your bent, and what you are so
				   resolved in, that you will make every thing give place to it. Let
				   nothing stand before your resolution of seeking the kingdom of God.
				   Whatever it be that you used to look upon as a convenience, or comfort,
				   or ease, or thing desirable on any account, if it stands in the way of
				   this great concern, let it be dismissed without hesitation; and if it
				   be of that nature that it is likely always to be a hinderance, then
				   wholly have done with it, and never entertain any expectation from it
				   more. If in time past you have, for the sake of worldly gain, involved
				   yourself in more care and business than you find to be consistent with
				   your being so thorough in the business of religion as you ought to be,
				   then get into some other way, though you suffer in your worldly
				   interest by it. Or if you have heretofore been conversant with company
				   that you have reason to think have been and will be a snare to you, and
				   a hinderance to this great design in any wise, break off from their
				   society, however it may expose you to reproach from your old
				   companions, or let what will be the effect of it. Whatever it be that
				   stands in the way of your most advantageously seeking salvation-whether
				   it be some dear sinful pleasure, or strong carnal appetite, or credit
				   and honour, or the good-will of some persons whose friendship you
				   desire, and whose esteem and liking you have highly valued-and though
				   there be danger, if you do as you ought, that you shall looked upon by
				   them as odd and ridiculous, and become contemptible in their eyes-or if
				   it be your ease and indolence and aversion to continual labour; or your
				   outward convenience in any respect, whereby you might avoid
				   difficulties of one kind or other-let all go; offer up all such things
				   together, as it were, in one sacrifice, to the interest of your soul.
				   Let nothing stand in competition with this, but make every thing to
				   fall before it. If the flesh must be crossed, then cross it, spare it
				   not, crucify it, and do not be afraid of being too cruel to it.
				   Galatians 5:24. "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with
				   the affections and lusts." Have no dependence on any worldly enjoyment
				   whatsoever. Let salvation be the one thing with you. This is what is
				   certainly required of you: and this is what many stick at; this giving
				   up other things for salvation, is a stumbling-block that few get over.
				   While others pressed into the kingdom of God at the preaching of John
				   the Baptist, Herod was pretty much stirred up by his preaching. It is
				   said, he heard him, and observed him, and did many things; but when he
				   came to tell him that he must part with his beloved Herodias, here he
				   stuck; this he never would yield to, Mark 7:18-20. The rich young man
				   was considerably concerned for salvation; and accordingly was a very
				   strict liver in many things: but when Christ came to direct him to go
				   and sell all that he had, and give to the poor, and come and follow
				   him, he could not find in his heart to comply with it, but went away
				   sorrowful. He had great possessions, and set his heart much on his
				   estate, and could not bear to part with it. It may be, if Christ had
				   directed him only to give away a considerable part of his estate, he
				   would have done it; yea, perhaps, if he had bid him part with half of
				   it, he would have complied with it: but when he directed him to throw
				   up all, he could not grapple with such a proposal. Herein the
				   straitness of the gate very much consists; and it is on this account
				   that so many seek to enter in, and are not able. There are many that
				   have a great mind to salvation, and spend great part of their time in
				   wishing they had it, but they will not comply with the necessary means.
				
				   2. Be directed to forget the things that are behind: that is, not to
				   keep thinking and making much of what you have done, but let your mind
				   be wholly intent on what you have to do. In some sense you ought to
				   look back; you should look back to your sins. Jeremiah 2:23. "See thy
				   way in the valley, know what thou hast done." You should look back on
				   the wretchedness of your religious performances, and consider how you
				   have fallen short in them; how exceedingly polluted all your duties
				   have been, and how justly God might reject and loathe them, and you for
				   them. But you ought not to spend your time in looking back, as many
				   persons do, thinking how much they have done for their salvation; what
				   great pains they have taken, how that they have done what they can, and
				   do not see how they can do more; how long a time they have been
				   seeking, and how much more they have done than others, and even than
				   such and such who have obtained mercy. They think with themselves how
				   hardly God deals with them, that he does not extend mercy to them, but
				   turns a deaf ear to their cries; and hence discourage themselves, and
				   complain of God. Do not thus spend your time in looking back on what is
				   past, but look forward, and consider what is before you; consider what
				   it is that you can do, and what it is necessary that you should do, and
				   what God calls you still to do, in order to your own salvation. The
				   apostle, in the third chapter to the Philippians, tells us what things
				   he did while a Jew, how much he had to boast of, if any could boast;
				   but he tells us, that he forgot those things, and all other things that
				   were behind, and reached forth towards the things that were before,
				   pressing forwards towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of
				   God in Christ Jesus.
				
				   3. Labour to get your heart thoroughly disposed to go on and hold out
				   to the end. Many that seem to be earnest have not a heart thus
				   disposed. It is a common thing for persons to appear greatly affected
				   for a little while; but all is soon past away, and there is no more to
				   be seen of it. Labour therefore to obtain a thorough willingness and
				   preparation of spirit, to continue seeking, in the use of your utmost
				   endeavours, without limitation; and do not think your whole life too
				   long. And in order to this, be advised to two things,
				
				   (1.) Remember that if ever God bestows mercy upon you, he will use his
				   sovereign pleasure about the time when. He will bestow it on some in a
				   little time, and on others not till they have sought it long. If other
				   persons are soon enlightened and comforted, while you remain long in
				   darkness, there is no other way but for you to wait. God will act
				   arbitrarily in this matter, and you cannot help it. You must even be
				   content to wait, in a way of laborious and earnest striving, till his
				   time comes. If you refuse, you will but undo yourself; and when you
				   shall hereafter find yourself undone, and see that your case is past
				   remedy, how will you condemn yourself for foregoing a great probability
				   of salvation, only because you had not the patience to hold out, and
				   was not willing to be at the trouble of a persevering labour! And what
				   will it avail before God or your own conscience to say, that you could
				   not bear to be obliged to seek salvation so long, when God bestowed it
				   on others that sought it but for a very short time? Though God may have
				   bestowed the testimonies of his favour on others in a few days or hours
				   after they have begun earnestly to seek it, how does that alter the
				   case as to you, if there proves to be a necessity of your laboriously
				   seeking many years before you obtain them? Is salvation less worth
				   taking a great deal of pains for, because, through the sovereign
				   pleasure of God, others have obtained it with comparatively little
				   pains? If there are two persons, the one of which has obtained
				   converting grace with comparative ease, and another that has obtained
				   it after continuing for many years in the greatest and most earnest
				   labours after it, how little difference does it make at last, when once
				   salvation is obtained! Put all the labour and pains, the long-continued
				   difficulties and strugglings, of the one in the scale against
				   salvation, and how little does it subtract; and put the ease with which
				   the other has obtained in the scale with salvation, and how little does
				   it add! What is either added or subtracted is lighter than vanity, and
				   a thing worthy of no consideration, when compared with that infinite
				   benefit that is obtained. Indeed if you were ten thousand years, and
				   all that time should strive and press forward with as great earnestness
				   as ever a person did for one day, all this would bear no proportion to
				   the importance of the benefit; and it will doubtless appear little to
				   you, when once you come to be in actual possession of eternal glory,
				   and to see what that eternal misery is which you have escaped. You must
				   not think much of your pains, and of the length of time; you must press
				   towards the kingdom of God, and do your utmost, and hold out to the
				   end, and learn to make no account of it when you have done. You must
				   undertake the business of seeking salvation upon these terms, and with
				   no other expectations than this, that if ever God bestows mercy it will
				   be in his own time; and not only so, but also that when you have done
				   all, God will not hold himself obliged to show you mercy at last.
				
				   (2.) Endeavour now thoroughly to weigh in your mind the difficulty, and
				   to count the cost of perseverence in seeking salvation. You that are
				   now setting out in this business, (as there are many here who have very
				   lately set about it;-Praised be the name of God that he has stirred you
				   up to it!) be exhorted to attend this direction. Do not undertake in
				   this affair with any other thought but of giving yourself wholly to it
				   for the remaining part of your life, and going through many and great
				   difficulties in it. Take heed that you do not engage secretly upon this
				   condition, that you shall obtain in a little time, promising yourself
				   that it shall be within this present season of the pouring out of God's
				   Spirit, or with any other limitation of time whatsoever. Many, when
				   they begin, (seeming to set out very earnestly,) do not expect that
				   they shall need to seek very long, and so do not prepare themselves for
				   it. And therefore, when they come to find it otherwise, and meet with
				   unexpected difficulty, they are found unguarded, and easily overthrown.
				   But let me advise you all who are now seeking salvation, not to
				   entertain any self-flattering thoughts; but weigh the utmost
				   difficulties of perseverance, and be provided for them, having your
				   mind fixed in it to go through them, let them be what they will.
				   Consider now beforehand, how tedious it would be, with utmost
				   earnestness and labour, to strive after salvation for many years, in
				   the mean time receiving no joyful or comfortable evidence of your
				   having obtained. Consider what a great temptation to discouragement
				   there probably would be in it; how apt you would be to yield the case;
				   how ready to think that it is in vain for you to seek any longer, and
				   that God never intends to show you mercy, in that he has not yet done
				   it; how apt you would be to think with yourself, "What an uncomfortable
				   life do I live! How much more unpleasantly do I spend my time than
				   others that do not perplex their minds about the things of another
				   world, but are at ease, and take the comfort of their worldly
				   enjoyments!" Consider what a temptation there would probably be in it,
				   if you saw others brought in that began to seek the kingdom of heaven
				   long after you, rejoicing in a hope and sense of God's favour, after
				   but little pains and a short time of awakening; while you, from day to
				   day, and from year to year, seemed to labour in vain. Prepare for such
				   tempations now. Lay in beforehand for such trials and difficulties,
				   that you may not think any strange thing has happened when they come.
				
				   I hope that those who have given attention to what has been said, have
				   by this time conceived, in some measure, what is signified by the
				   expression in the text, and after what manner they ought to press into
				   the kingdom of God. Here is this to induce you to a compliance with
				   what you have been directed to; if you sit still, you die; if you go
				   backward, behold you shall surely die; if you go forward, you may live.
				   And though God has not bound himself to any thing that a person does
				   while destitute of faith, and out of Christ, yet there is great
				   probability, that in a way of hearkening to this counsel you will live;
				   and that by pressing onward, and persevering, you will at last, as it
				   were by violence, take the kingdom of heaven. Those of you who have not
				   only heard the directions given, but shall through God's merciful
				   assistance, practise according to them, are those that probably will
				   overcome. These we may well hope at last to see standing with the Lamb
				   on mount Sion, clothed in white robes, with palms in their hands; when
				   all your labour and toil will be abundantly compensated, and you will
				   not repent that you have taken so much pains, and denied yourself much,
				   and waited so long. This self-denial, this waiting, will then look
				   little, and vanish into nothing in your eyes, being all swallowed up in
				   the first minute's enjoyment of that glory that you will then possess,
				   and will uninterruptedly possess and enjoy to all eternity.
				
				   4th Direction. Improve the present season of the pouring out of the
				   Spirit of God on this town. Prudence is any affair whatsoever consists
				   very much in minding and improving our opportunities. If you would have
				   spiritual prosperity, you must exercise prudence in the concerns of
				   your souls, as well as in outward concerns when you seek outward
				   prosperity. The prudent husbandman will observe his opportunities; he
				   will improve seed-time and harvest; he will make his advantage of the
				   showers and shines of heaven. The prudent merchant will discern his
				   opportunities; he will not be idle on a market-day; he is careful not
				   to let slip his seasons for enriching himself: So will those who
				   prudently seek the fruits of righteousness, and the merchandise of
				   wisdom, improve their opportunities for their eternal wealth and
				   happiness.
				
				   God is pleased at this time, in a very remarkable manner, to pour out
				   his Spirit amongst us; (glory be to his name!) You that have a mind to
				   obtain converting grace, and to go to heaven when you die, now is your
				   season! Now, if you have any sort of prudence for your own salvation,
				   and have not a mind to go to hell, improve this season! Now is the
				   accepted time! Now is the day of salvation! You that in time past have
				   been called upon, and have turned a deaf ear to God's voice, and long
				   stood out and resisted his commands and counsels, hear God's voice
				   today, while it is called today! Do not harden your hearts at such a
				   day as this! Now you have a special and remarkable price put into your
				   hands to get wisdom, if you have but a heart to improve it.
				
				   God hath his certain days or appointed seasons of exercising both mercy
				   and judgment. There are some remarkable times of wrath, laid out by God
				   for his awful visitation, and the executions of his anger; which times
				   are called days of vengeance, Proverbs 6:34. Wherein God will visit
				   sin, Exodus 32:34. And so, on the contrary, God has laid out in his
				   sovereign counsels seasons of remarkable mercy, wherein he will
				   manifest himself in the exercises of his grace and loving-kindness,
				   more than at other times. Such times in Scripture are called by way of
				   eminency, accepted times, and days of salvation, and also days of God's
				   visitation; because they are days wherein God will visit in a way of
				   mercy; as in Luke 19:44. "And shall lay thee even with the ground, and
				   thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone
				   upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation." It
				   is such a time now in this town; it is with us a day of God's gracious
				   visitation. It is indeed a day of grace with us as long as we live in
				   this world, in the enjoyment of the means of grace; but such a time as
				   this is especially, and in a distinguishing manner, a day of grace.
				   There is a door of mercy always standing open for sinners; but such a
				   day as this, God opens an extraordinary door.
				
				   We are directed to seek the Lord while he may be found, and to call
				   upon him while he is near, Isaiah 55:6. If you that are hitherto
				   Christless, be not strangely besotted and infatuated, you will by all
				   means improve such an opportunity as this to get heaven, when heaven is
				   brought so near, when the fountain is opened in the midst of us in so
				   extraordinary a manner. Now is the time to obtain a supply of the
				   necessities of your poor perishing souls! This is the day for sinners
				   that have a mind to be converted before they die, when God is dealing
				   forth so liberally and bountifully amongst us; when conversion and
				   salvation work is going on amongst us from sabbath to sabbath, and many
				   are pressing into the kingdom of God! Now do not stay behind, but press
				   in amongst the rest! Others have been stirred up to be in good earnest,
				   and have taken heaven by violence; be entreated to follow their
				   example, if you would have a part of the inheritance with them, and
				   would not be left at the great day, when they are taken!
				
				   How should it move you to consider that you have this opportunity now
				   in your hands! You are in the actual possession of it! If it were past,
				   it would not be in your power to recover it, or in the power of any
				   creature to bring it back for you; but it is not past; it is now, at
				   this day. Now is the accepted time, even while it is called today! Will
				   you sit still at such a time? Will you sleep in such a harvest? Will
				   you deal with a slack hand, and stay behind out of mere sloth, or love
				   to some lust, or lothness to grapple with some small difficulty, or to
				   put yourself a little out of your way, when so many are flowing to the
				   goodness of the Lord? You are behind still; and so you will be in
				   danger of being left behind, when the whole number is completed that
				   are to enter in, if you do not earnestly bestir yourself! To be left
				   behind at the close of such a season as this, will be awful-next to
				   being left behind on that day when God's saints shall mount up as with
				   wings to meet the Lord in the air-and will be what will appear very
				   threatening of it.
				
				   God is now calling you in an extraordinary manner: and it is agreeable
				   to the will and word of Christ, that I should now, in his name, call
				   you, as one set over you, and sent to you to that end; so it is his
				   will that you should hearken to what I say, as his voice. I therefore
				   beseech you in Christ's stead now to press into the kingdom of God!
				   Whoever you are, whether young or old, small or great; if you are a
				   great sinner, if you have been a backslider, if you have quenched the
				   Spirit, be who you will, do not stand making objections, but arise,
				   apply yourself to your work! Do what you have to do with your might.
				   Christ is calling you before, and holding forth his grace, and
				   everlasting benefits, and wrath is pursuing you behind; wherefore fly
				   for your life, and look not behind you! But here I would particularly
				   direct myself to several sorts of persons.
				
				   I. To those sinners who are in a measure awakened, and are concerned
				   for their salvation. You have reason to be glad that you have such an
				   opportunity, and to prize it above gold. To induce you to prize and
				   improve it, consider several things.
				
				   1. God has doubtless a design now to deal forth saving blessings to a
				   number. God has done it to some already, and it is not probable that he
				   has yet finished his work amongst us: we may well hope still to see
				   others brought out of darkness into marvellous light. And therefore,
				
				   2. God comes this day, and knocks at many persons' doors, and at your
				   door among the rest. God seems to be come in a very unusual manner
				   amongst us, upon a gracious and merciful design; a design of saving a
				   number of poor miserable souls out of a lost and perishing condition,
				   and of bringing them into a happy state and eternal glory! This is
				   offered to you, not only as it has always been in the word and
				   ordinances, but by the particular influences of the Spirit of Christ
				   awakening you! This special offer is made to many amongst us; and you
				   are not passed over. Christ has not forgot you; but has come to your
				   door; and there as it were stands waiting for you to open to him. If
				   you have wisdom and discretion to discern your own advantage, you will
				   know that now is your opportunity.
				
				   3. How much more easily converting grace is obtained at such a time,
				   than at other times! The work is equally easy with God at all times;
				   but there is far less difficulty in the way as to men at such a time,
				   than at other times. It is, as I said before, a day of God's gracious
				   visitation; a day that he has as it were set apart for the more
				   liberally and bountifully dispensing of his grace; a day wherein God's
				   hand is opened wide. Experience shows it. God seems to be more ready to
				   help, to give proper convictions, to help against temptations, and let
				   in divine light. He seems to carry on his work with a more glorious
				   discovery of his power, and Satan is more chained up than at other
				   times. Those difficulties and temptations that persons before struck
				   at, from year to year, they are soon helped over. The work of God is
				   carried on with greater speed and swiftness, and there are often
				   instances of sudden conversion at such a time. So it was in the
				   apostles' days, when there was a time of the most extraordinary pouring
				   out of the Spirit that ever was. How quick and sudden were conversions
				   in those days! Such instances as that of the jailer abounded then, in
				   fulfillment of that prophecy, Isaiah 66:7, 8. "Before she travailed,
				   she brought forth: before her pain came she was delivered of a
				   man-child. Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? For
				   as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children." So it is in
				   some degree, whenever there is an extraordinary pouring out of the
				   Spirit of God; more or less so, in proportion to the greatness of that
				   effusion. There is seldom such quick work made of it at other times.
				   Persons are not so soon delivered from their various temptations and
				   entanglements; but are much longer wandering in a wilderness, and
				   groping in darkness. And yet,
				
				   4. There are probably some here present that are now concerned about
				   their salvation, that will never obtain. It is not to be supposed that
				   all that are now moved and awakened, will ever be savingly converted.
				   Doubtless there are many now seeking that will not be able to enter.
				   When has it been so in times past, when there has been times of great
				   outpourings of God's Spirit, but that many who for a while have
				   inquired with others, what they should do to be saved, have failed, and
				   afterwards grown hard and secure? All of you that are now awakened,
				   have a mind to obtain salvation, and probably hope to get a title to
				   heaven, in the time of this present moving of God's Spirit: but yet,
				   (though it be awful to be spoken, and awful to be thought) we have no
				   reason to think any other, than that some of you will burn in hell to
				   all eternity. You all are afraid of hell, and seem at present disposed
				   to take pains to be delivered from it; and yet it would be unreasonable
				   to think any other, than that some of you will have your portion in the
				   lake that burns with fire and brimstone. Though there are so many that
				   seem to obtain so easily, having been but a little while under
				   convictions, yet, for all that, some never will obtain. Some will soon
				   lose the sense of things they now have; though their awakenings seem to
				   be very considerable for the present, they will not hold; they have not
				   hearts disposed to hold on through very many difficulties. Some that
				   have set out for heaven, and hope as much as others to obtain, are
				   indeed but slighty and slack, even now, in the midst of such a time as
				   this. And others, who for the present seem to be more in earnest, will
				   probably, before long, decline and fail, and gradually return to be as
				   they were before. The convictions of some seem to be great, while that
				   which is the occasion of their convictions is new; which, when that
				   begins to grow old, will gradually decay and wear off. Thus, it may be,
				   the occasion of your awakening has been the hearing of the conversion
				   of some person, or seeing so extraordinary a dispensation of Providence
				   as this in which God now appears amongst us; but by and by the newness
				   and freshness of these things will be gone, and so will not affect your
				   mind as now they do; and it may be your convictions will go away with
				   it.
				
				   Though this be a time wherein God doth more liberally bestow his grace,
				   and so a time of greater advantage for obtaining it; yet there seems to
				   be, upon some accounts, greater danger of backsliding, than when
				   persons are awakened at other times. For commonly such extraordinary
				   times do not last long; and then when they cease, there are multitudes
				   that lose their convictions as it were together.
				   We speak of it as a happy thing, that God is pleased to cause such a
				   time amongst us, and so it is indeed: but there are some to whom it
				   will be no benefit; it will be an occasion of their greater misery;
				   they will wish they had never seen this time; it will be more tolerable
				   for those that never saw it, or any thing like it, in the day of
				   judgment, than for them. It is an awful consideration, that there are
				   probably those here, whom the great Judge will hereafter call to a
				   strict account about this very thing, why they no better improved this
				   opportunity, when he set open the fountain of his grace, and so loudly
				   called upon them, and came and strove with them in particular, by the
				   awakening influences of his Spirit; and they will have no good account
				   to give to the Judge, but their mouths will be stopped, and they will
				   stand speechless before him.
				   You had need therefore to be earnest, and very resolved in this affair,
				   that you may not be one of those who shall thus fail, that you may so
				   fight, as not uncertainly, and so run, as that you may win the prize.
				
				   5. Consider in what sad circumstances times of extraordinary effusion
				   of God's Spirit commonly leave persons, when they leave them
				   unconverted. They find them in a doleful, because in a natural,
				   condition; but commonly leave them in a much more doleful condition.
				   They are left dreadfully hardened, and with a great increase of guilt,
				   and their souls under a more strong dominion and possession of Satan.
				   And frequently seasons of extraordinary advantage for salvation,when
				   they pass over persons, and they do not improve them, nor receive any
				   good in them, seal their damnation. As such seasons leave them, God for
				   ever leaves them, and gives them up to judicial hardness. Luke 19:41,
				   42. "And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
				   saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, the things which belong unto
				   thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes."
				
				   6. Consider, that it is very uncertain whether you will ever see such
				   another time as this. If there should be such another time, it is very
				   uncertain uncertain whether you will live to another time, it is very
				   uncertain whether you will eve whether you will live to see it. Many
				   that are now concerned for their salvation amongst us, will probably be
				   in their graves, and it may be in hell, before that time; and if you
				   should miss this opportunity, it may be so with you. And what good will
				   that do you, to have the Spirit of God poured out upon earth, in the
				   place where you once lived, while you are tormented in hell? What will
				   it avail you, that others are crying, What shall I do to be saved?
				   while you are shut up for ever in the bottomless pit, and are wailing
				   and gnashing your teeth in everlasting burnings?
				
				   Wherefore improve this opportunity, while God is pouring out his
				   Spirit, and you are on earth, and while you dwell in the place where
				   the Spirit of God is thus poured out, and you yourself have the
				   awakening influences of it, that you may never wail and gnash your
				   teeth in hell, but may sing in heaven for ever, with others that are
				   redeemed from amongst men, and redeemed amongst us.
				
				   7. If you should see another such time, it will be under far greater
				   disadvantages than now. You will probably then be much older, and will
				   have more hardened your heart; and so will be under less probability of
				   receiving good. Some persons are so hardened in sin, and so left of
				   God, that they can live through such a time as this, and not be much
				   awakened or affected by it; they can stand their ground, and be but
				   little moved. And so it may be with you, by another such time, if there
				   should be another amongst us, and you should live to see it. The case
				   in all probability will be greatly altered with you by that time.
				
				   If you should continue Christless and graceless till then, you will be
				   much further from the kingdom of God, and much deeper involved in
				   snares and misery; and the devil will probably have a vastly greater
				   advantage against you, to tempt and confound you.
				
				   8. We do not know but that God is now gathering in his elect, before
				   some great and sore judgment. It has been God's manner before he casts
				   off a visible people, or brings some great and destroying judgments
				   upon them, first to gather in his elect, that they may be secure. So it
				   was before the casting off the Jews from being God's people. There was
				   first a very remarkable pouring out of the Spirit, and gathering in of
				   the elect, by the preaching of the apostles and evangelists, as we read
				   in the beginning of the Acts: but after this the harvest and its
				   gleanings were over, the rest were blinded, and hardened; the gospel
				   had little success amongst them, and the nation was given up, and cast
				   off from being God's people, and their city and land was destroyed by
				   the Romans in a terrible manner; and they have been cast off by God now
				   for a great many ages, and still remain a hardened and rejected people.
				   So we read in the beginning of the 7th chapter of the Revelations, that
				   God, when about to bring destroying judgments on the earth, first
				   sealed his servants in the forehead. He set his seal upon the hearts of
				   the elect, gave them the saving influences and indwelling of his
				   Spirit, by which they were sealed to the day of redemption. Revelation
				   7:1-3. "And after these things, I saw four angels standing on the four
				   corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the
				   wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And
				   I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the
				   living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom
				   it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth,
				   neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our
				   God in their foreheads."
				
				   And this may be the case now, that God is about, in a great measure, to
				   forsake this land, and give up this people, and to bring most awful and
				   overwhelming judgments upon it, and that he is now gathering in his
				   elect, to secure them from the calamity. The state of the nation, and
				   of this land, never looked so threatening of such a thing as at this
				   day. The present aspect of things exceedingly threatens vital religion,
				   and even those truths that are especially the foundation of it, out of
				   this land. If it should be so, how awful will the case be with those
				   that shall be left, and not brought in, while God continues the
				   influences of his Spirit, to gather in those that are to be redeemed
				   from amongst us!
				
				   9. If you neglect the present opportunity, and be finally unbelieving,
				   those that are converted in this time of the pouring out of God's
				   Spirit will rise up in judgment against you. Your neighbors, your
				   relations, acquaintance, or companions that are converted, will that
				   day appear against you. They will not only be taken while you are left,
				   mounting up with joy to meet the Lord in the air-at his right hand with
				   glorious saints and angels, while you are at the left with devils-but
				   how they will rise up in judgment against you.
				
				   However friendly you have been together, and have taken pleasure in one
				   another's company, and have often familiarly conversed together, they
				   will then surely appear against you. They will rise up as witnesses,
				   and will declare what a precious opportunity you had, and did not
				   improve; how you continued unbelieving, and rejected the offers of a
				   Saviour, when those offers were made in so extraordinary a manner, and
				   when so many others were prevailed upon to accept of Christ; how you
				   was negligent and slack, and did not know the things that belonged to
				   your peace, in that your day. And not only so, but they shall be your
				   judges, as assessors with the great Judge; and as such will appear
				   against you; they will be with the Judge in passing sentence upon you.
				   I Corinthians 6:2. "Know ye not that the saints shall judge the world?"
				   Christ will admit them to the honour of judging the world with him:
				   "They shall sit with him in his throne," Revelation 3:21. "They shall
				   sit with Christ in his throne of government, and they shall sit with
				   him in his throne of judgment, and shall be judges with him when you
				   are judged, and as such shall condemn you.
				
				   10. And lastly, You do not know that you shall live through the present
				   time of the pouring out of God's Spirit. You may be taken away in the
				   midst of it, or you may be taken away in the beginning of it; as God in
				   his providence is putting you in mind, by the late instance of death in
				   a young person in the town.* God has of late been very awful in his
				   dealings with us, in the repeated deaths of young persons amongst us.
				   This should stir every one up to be in the more haste to press into the
				   kingdom of God, that so you may be safe whenever death comes. This is a
				   blessed season and opportunity; but you do not know how little of it
				   you may have. You may have much less of it than others; may by death be
				   suddenly snatched away from all advantages that are here enjoyed for
				   the good of souls. Therefore make haste, and escape for thy life. One
				   moment's delay is dangerous; for wrath is pursuing, and divine
				   vengeance hanging over every uncovered person.
				   Let these considerations move every one to be improving this
				   opportunity, that while others receive saving good, and are made heirs
				   of eternal glory, you may not be left behind, in the same miserable
				   doleful circumstances in which you came into the world, a poor captive
				   to sin and Satan, a lost sheep, a perishing, undone creature, sinking
				   down into everlasting perdition; that you may not be one of them spoken
				   of, Jeremiah 17:6. "That shall be like the heath in the desert, and
				   shall not see when good comes." If you do not improve this opportunity,
				   remember I have told you, you will hereafter lament it; and if you do
				   not lament it in this world, then I will leave it with you to remember
				   it throughout a miserable eternity.
				
				   II. I would address myself to such as yet remain unawakened. It is an
				   awful thing that there should be any one person remaining secure
				   amongst us at such a time as this; but yet it is to be feared that
				   there are some of this sort. I would here a little expostulate with
				   such persons.
				
				   * Joseph Clark's wife, a young woman lately married, that died suddenly
				   the week before this was delivered.
				
				   1. When do you expect that it will be more likely that you should be
				   awakened and wrought upon than now? You are in a Christless condition;
				   and yet without doubt intend to go to heaven; and therefore intend to
				   be converted some time before you die; but this is not to be expected
				   till you are first awakened, and deeply concerned about the welfare of
				   your soul, and brought earnestly to seek God's converting grace. And
				   when do you intend that this shall be? How do you lay things out in
				   your own mind, or what projection have you about this matter? Is it
				   ever so likely that a person will be awakened, as at such a time as
				   this? How do we see many, who before were secure, now roused out of
				   their sleep, and crying, What shall I do to be saved? But you are yet
				   secure! Do you flatter yourself that it will be more likely you should
				   be awakened when it is a dull and dead time? Do you lay matters out
				   thus in your own mind, that though you are senseless when others are
				   generally awakened, that yet you shall be awakened when others are
				   generally senseless? Or do you hope to see another such time of the
				   pouring out of God's Spirit hereafter? And do you think it will be more
				   likely that you should be wrought upon then, than now? And why do you
				   think so? Is it because then you shall be so much older than you are
				   now, and so that your heart will be grown softer and more tender with
				   age? or because you will then have stood out so much longer against the
				   calls of the gospel, and all means of grace? Do you think it more
				   likely that God will give you the needed influences of his Spirit then,
				   than now, because then you will have provoked him so much more, and
				   your sin and guilt will be so much greater? And do you think it will be
				   any benefit to you, to stand it out through the present season of
				   grace, as proof against the extraordinary means of awakening there are?
				   Do you think that this will be a good preparation for a saving work of
				   the Spirit hereafter?
				
				   2. What means do you expect to be awakened by? As to the awakening
				   awful things of the word of God, you have had those set before you
				   times without number, in the most moving manner that the dispensers of
				   the word have been capable of. As to particular solemn warnings,
				   directed to those that are in your circumstances, you have had them
				   frequently, and have them now from time to time. Do you expect to be
				   awakened by awful providences? Those also you have lately had, of the
				   most awakening nature, one after another. Do you expect to be moved by
				   the deaths of others? We have lately had repeated instances of these.
				   There have been deaths of old and young: the year has been remarkable
				   for the deaths of young persons in the bloom of life; and some of them
				   very sudden deaths. Will the conversion of others move you? There is
				   indeed scarce any thing that is found to have so great a tendency to
				   stir persons up as this: and this you have been tried with of late in
				   frequent instances; but are hitherto proof against it. Will a general
				   pouring out of the Spirit, and seeing a conern about salvation amongst
				   all sorts of people, do it? This means you now have, but without
				   effect. Yea, you have all these things together; you have the solemn
				   warnings of God's word, and awful instances of death, and the
				   conversion of others, and see a general concern about salvation: but
				   all together do not move you to any great concern about your own
				   precious, immortal, and miserable soul. Therefore consider by what
				   means it is that you expect ever to be awakened.
				
				   You have heard that it is probable some who are now awakened, will
				   never obtain salvation; how dark then does it look upon you that remain
				   stupidly unawakened! Those who are not moved at such a time as this,
				   come to adult age, have reason to fear whether they are not given up to
				   judicial hardness. I do not say they have reason to conclude it, but
				   they have reason to fear it. How dark doth it look upon you, that God
				   comes and knocks at so many persons' doors, and misses yours! that God
				   is giving the strivings of his Spirit so generally amongst us, while
				   you ar left senseless!
				
				   3. Do you expect to obtain salvation without ever seeking it? If you
				   are sensible that there is a necessity of your seeking in order to
				   obtaining, and ever intend to seek, one would think you could not avoid
				   it at such a time as this. Inquire therefore, whether you intend to go
				   to heaven, living all your days a secure, negligent, careless life.-Or,
				
				   4. Do you think you can bear the damnation of hell? Do you imagine that
				   you can tolerably endure the devouring fire, and everlasting burnings?
				   Do you hope that you shall be able to grapple with the vengeance of God
				   Almighty, when he girds himself with strength, and clothes himself with
				   wrath? Do you think to strengthen yourself against God, and to be able
				   to make your part good with him? I Corinthians 10:22. "Do we provoke
				   the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" Do you flatter yourself
				   that you shall find out ways for your ease and support, and to make it
				   out tolerably well, to bear up your spirit in those everlasting
				   burnings that are prepared for the devil and his angels? Ezekiel 22:14.
				   "Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that
				   I shall deal with thee?"-It is a difficult thing to conceive what such
				   Christless persons think, that are unconcerned at such a time.
				
				   III. I would direct myself to them who are grown considerably into
				   years, and are yet in a natural condition. I would now take occasion
				   earnestly to exhort you to improve this extraordinary opportunity, and
				   press into the kingdom of God. You have lost many advantages that once
				   you had, and now have not the same advantages that others have. The
				   case is very different with you from what it is with many of your
				   neighbours. You, above all, had need to improve such an opportunity.
				   Now is the time for you to bestir yourself, and take the kingdom of
				   heaven!-Consider,
				
				   1. Now there seems to be a door opened for old sinners. Now God is
				   dealing forth freely to all sorts: his hand is opened wide, and he does
				   not pass by old ones so much as he used to do. You are not under such
				   advantages as others who are younger; but yet, so wonderfully has God
				   ordered it, that now you are not destitute of great advantage. Though
				   old in sin, God has put a new and extraordinary advantage in your
				   hands. O! improve this price you have to get wisdom. You that have been
				   long seeking to enter in at the strait gate and yet remain without, now
				   take your opportunity and press in! You that have been long in the
				   wilderness, fighting with various temptations, labouring under
				   discouragements, ready to give up the case, and have been often tempted
				   to despair, now, behold the door that God opens for you! Do not give
				   way to discouragements now; this is not a time for it. Do not spend
				   time in thinking, that you have done what you can already, and that you
				   are not elected, and in giving way to other perplexing, weakening,
				   disheartening temptations. Do not waste away this precious opportunity
				   in such a manner. You have no time to spare for such things as these;
				   God calls you now to something else. Improve this time in seeking and
				   striving for salvation, and not in that which tends to hinder it.-It is
				   no time now for you to stand talking with the devil; but hearken to
				   God, and apply yourself to that which he does now so loudly call you
				   to.
				   Some of you have often lamented the loss of past opportunties,
				   particularly, the loss of the time of youth, and have been wishing that
				   you had so good an opportunity again; and have been ready to say, "O!
				   if I was young again, how would I improve such an advantage!" That
				   opportunity which you have had in time past is irrecoverable; you can
				   never have it again; but God can give you other advantages of another
				   sort, that are very great, and he is so doing at this day. He is now
				   putting a new opportunity into your hands; though not of the same kind
				   with that which you once had, and have lost, yet in some respects as
				   great of another kind. If you lament your folly in neglecting and
				   losing past opportunties, then do not be guilty of the folly of
				   neglecting the opportunity which God now gives you. This opportunity
				   you could not have purchased, if you would have given all that you had
				   in the world for it. But God is putting it into your hands himself, of
				   his own free and sovereign mercy, without your purchasing it. Therefore
				   when you have it, do not neglect it.
				
				   2. It is a great deal more likely with respect to such persons than
				   others, that this is their last time. There will be a last time of
				   special offer of salvation to impenitent sinners-"God's Spirit shall
				   not always strive with man," Genesis 6:3. God sometimes continues long
				   knocking at the doors of wicked men's hearts; but there are the last
				   knocks, and the last calls that ever they shall have. And sometimes
				   God's last calls are the loudest; and then if sinners do not hearken,
				   he finally leaves them. How long has God been knocking at many of your
				   doors that are old in sin! It is a great deal more likely that these
				   are his last knocks. You have resisted God's Spirit in times past, and
				   have hardened your heart once and again; but God will not be thus dealt
				   with always. There is danger, that if now, after so long a time, you
				   will not hearken, he will utterly desert you, and leave you to walk in
				   your own counsels.
				
				   It seems by God's providence, as though God had yet an elect number
				   amongst old sinners in this place, that perhaps he is now about to
				   bring in. It looks as though there were some that long lived under Mr.
				   Stoddard's ministry, that God has not utterly cast off, though they
				   stood it out under such great means as they then enjoyed. It is to be
				   hoped that God will now bring in a remnant from among them. But it is
				   more likely that God is now about finishing with them, one way or
				   other, for their having been so long the subjects of such extraordinary
				   means. You have seen former times of the pouring out of God's Spirit
				   upon the town, when others were taken and you left, others were called
				   out of darkness into marvelous light, and were brought into a glorious
				   and happy state, and you saw not good when good came. How dark will
				   your circumstances appear, if you shall also stand it out through this
				   opportunity, and still be left behind! Take heed that you be not of
				   those spoken of, Hebrews 6:7, 8. that are like the "earth that has rain
				   coming oft upon it, and only bears briers and thorns." As we see there
				   are some pieces of ground, the more showers of rain fall upon them, the
				   more fruitful seasons there are, the more do the briers, and other
				   useless and hurtful plants, that are rooted in them, grow and flourish.
				   Of such ground the apostle says, "It is rejected, and is nigh unto
				   cursing, whose end is to be burned." The way that the husbandman takes
				   with such ground, is, to set fire to it, to burn up the growth of
				   it.-If you miss this opportunity, there is danger that you will be
				   utterly rejected, and that your end will be to be burned. And if this
				   is to be, it is to be feared, that you are not far from, but nigh unto,
				   cursing.
				
				   Those of you that are already grown old in sin, and are now under
				   awakenings, when you feel your convictions begin to go off, if ever
				   that should be, then remember what you have now been told; it may well
				   then strike you to the heart!
				
				   IV. I would direct the advice to those that are young, and now under
				   their first special convictions. I would earnestly urge such to improve
				   this opportunity, and press into the kingdom of God.-Consider two
				   things,
				
				   1. You have all manner of advantages now centering upon you. It is a
				   time of great advantage for all; but your advantages are above others.
				   There is no other sort of persons that have now so great and happy an
				   opportunity as you have.-You have the great advantage that is common to
				   all who live in this place, viz. That now it is a time of the
				   extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit of God. And have you not that
				   great advantage, the awakening influences of the Spirit of God on you
				   in particular? and besides, you have this peculiar advantage, that you
				   are now in your youth. And added to this, you have another unspeakable
				   advantage, that you now are under your first convictions. Happy is he
				   that never has hardened his heart, and blocked up his own way to heaven
				   by backsliding, and has now the awakening influences of God's Spirit,
				   if God does but enable him thoroughly to improve them! Such above all
				   in the world bid fair for the kingdom of God. God is wont on such,
				   above any kind of persons, as it were easily and readily to bestow the
				   saving grace and comforts of his Spirit. Instances of speedy and sudden
				   conversion are most commonly found among such. Happy are they that have
				   the Spirit of God with them, and never have quenched it, if they did
				   but know the price they have in their hands!
				
				   If you have a sense of your necessity of salvation, and the great worth
				   and value of it, you will be willing to take the surest way to it, or
				   that which has the greatest probability of success; and that certainly
				   is, thoroughly to improve your first convictions. If you so go, it is
				   not likely that you will fail; there is the greatest probability that
				   you will succeed.-What is it not worth, to have such an advantage in
				   one's hands for obtaining eternal life? The present season of the
				   pouring out of God's Spirit, is the first that many of you who are now
				   under awakenings have ever seen, since you came to years of
				   understanding. On which account, it is the greatest opportunity that
				   ever you had, and probably by far the greatest that ever you will have.
				   There are many here present who wish they had such an opportunity, but
				   they never can obtain it; they cannot buy it for money; but you have it
				   in your possession, and can improve it if you will. But yet,
				
				   2. There is on some accounts greater danger that such as are in your
				   circumstances will fail of thoroughly improving their convictions, with
				   respect to stedfastness and perseverance, than others. Those that are
				   young are more unstable than elder persons. They who never had
				   convictions before, have less experience of the difficulty of the work
				   they have engaged in; they are more ready to think that they shall
				   obtain salvation easily, and are more easily discouraged by
				   disappointments; and young persons have less reason and consideration
				   to fortify them against temptations to backsliding. You should
				   therefore labour now the more to guard against such temptations. By all
				   means make but one work of seeking salvation! Make thorough work of it
				   the first time! There are vast disadvantages that they bring themselves
				   under, who have several turns of seeking with great intermissions. By
				   such a course, persons exceedingly wound their own souls, and entangle
				   themselves in many snares. Who are those that commonly meet with so
				   many difficulties, and are so long labouring in darkness and
				   perplexity, but those who have had several turns at seeking salvation;
				   who have one while had convictions, and then have quenched them, and
				   then have set about the work again, and have backslidden again, and
				   have gone on after that manner? The children of Israel would not have
				   been forty years in the wilderness, if they had held their courage, and
				   had gone on as they set out; but they were of an unstable mind, and
				   were for going back again into Egypt.-Otherwise, if they had gone right
				   forward without discouragement, as God would have led them, they would
				   have soon entered and taken possession of Canaan. They had got to the
				   very borders of it when they turned back, but were thirty-eight years
				   after that, before they got through the wilderness. Therefore, as you
				   regard the interest of your soul, do not run yourself into a like
				   difficulty, by unsteadiness, intermission, and backsliding; but press
				   right forward, from henceforth, and make but one work of seeking,
				   converting, and pardoning grace, however great, and difficult, and long
				   a work that may be.

				Many Mansions
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				A Sermon
				
				  by
				
				Jonathan Edwards
				
				      [Sermon Date: "The Sabbath after the seating of the New Meeting House, Dec
				      25, 1737."]
				     __________________________________________________________________
				
				    John 14:2 -- In My Father's house are many mansions.
				
				   IN these words may be observed two things,
				
				   1. The thing described, viz., Christ's Father's house. Christ spoke to
				   his disciples in the foregoing chapter as one that was about to leave
				   them. He told 'em, verse 31, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God
				   is glorified in him," and then goes to giving of them counsel to live
				   in unity and love one another, as one that was going from them. By
				   which they seemed somewhat surprised and hardly knew what to make of
				   it. And one of them, viz., Peter, asked him where he was going; verse
				   36, "Simon Peter said unto him, Lord whither goest thou?" Christ did
				   not directly answer and tell him where he was going, but he signifies
				   where in these words afterwards, in the verse 12, he tells 'em plainly
				   that he was going to his Father.
				
				   2. We may observe the description given of it, viz., that in it there
				   are many mansions. The disciples seemed very sorrowful at the news of
				   Christ's going away, but Christ comforts 'em with that, that in his
				   Father's house where he was going there was not only room for him, but
				   room for them too. There were many mansions. There was not only a
				   mansion there for him, but there were mansions enough for them all;
				   there was room enough in heaven for them. When the disciples perceived
				   that Christ was going away, they manifested a great desire to go with
				   him, and particularly Peter. Peter in the latter part of the foregoing
				   chapter asked him whither he went to that end that he might follow him.
				   Christ told him that whither he went he could not follow him now, but
				   that he should follow him afterwards. But Peter, not content with
				   Christ, seemed to have a great mind to follow him now. "Lord," says he,
				   "why cannot I follow thee now?" So that the disciples had a great mind
				   still to be with Christ, and Christ in the words of the text intimates
				   that they shall be with him. Christ signifies to 'em that he was going
				   home to his Father's house, and he encourages 'em that they shall be
				   with him there in due time, in that there were many mansions there.
				   There was a mansion provided not only for him, but for them all (for
				   Judas was not then present), and not only for them, but for all that
				   should ever believe in him to the end of the world; and though he went
				   before, he only went to prepare a place for them that should follow.
				
				   The text is a plain sentence; 'tis therefore needless to press any
				   doctrine in other words from it: so that I shall build my discourse on
				   the words of the text. There are two propositions contained in the
				   words, viz.,
				
				   I. that heaven is God's house, and
				
				   II. that in this house of God there are many mansions.
				
				   Prop. I. Heaven is God's house. An house of public worship is an house
				   where God's people meet from time to time to attend on God's
				   ordinances, and that is set apart for that and is called God's house.
				   The temple of Solomon was called God's house. God was represented as
				   dwelling there. There he has his throne in the holy of holies, even the
				   mercy seat over the ark and between the cherubims.
				
				   Sometimes the whole universe is represented in Scripture as God's
				   house, built with various stories one above another: Amos 9:6, "It is
				   he that buildeth his stories in the heaven;" and Psalm 104:3, "Who
				   layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters." But the highest heaven
				   is especially represented in Scripture as the house of God. As to other
				   parts of the creation, God hath appointed them to inferior uses; but
				   this part he has reserved for himself for his own abode. We are told
				   that the heavens are the Lord's, but the earth he hath given to the
				   sons of men. God, though he is everywhere present, is represented both
				   in Old Testament and New as being in heaven is a special and peculiar
				   manner. Heaven is the temple of God. Thus we read of God's temple in
				   heaven, Revelation 15:5. Solomon's temple was a type of heaven. The
				   apostle Paul is his epistle to the Hebrews does from time to time call
				   heaven the holy of holies, as being the antitype not only of the temple
				   of Solomon, but of the most holy place in that temple, which was the
				   place of God's most immediate residence: Hebrews 9:12, "He entered in
				   once into the holy place;" verse 24, "For Christ is not entered into
				   the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but
				   into heaven itself." Houses where assemblies of Christians worship God
				   are in some respects figures of this house of God above. When God is
				   worshipped in them in spirit and truth, they become the outworks of
				   heaven and as it were its gates. As in houses of public worship here
				   there are assemblies of Christians meeting to worship God, so in heaven
				   there is a glorious assembly, or Church, continually worshipping God:
				   Hebrews 12:22,23, "But ye are come unto mount Sion, [and unto] the city
				   of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
				   company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn,
				   that are written in heaven."
				
				   Heaven is represented in Scripture as God's dwelling-house; Psalm
				   113:5, "Who is like [unto] the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high," and
				   Psalm 123:1, "Unto thee I lift up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in
				   the heavens." Heaven is God's palace. 'Tis the house of the great King
				   of the universe; there he has his throne, which is therefore
				   represented as his house or temple; Psalm 11:4, "The Lord is in his
				   holy temple; the Lord's throne is in heaven."
				
				   Heaven is the house where God dwells with his family. God is
				   represented in Scripture as having a family; and though some of this
				   family are now on earth, yet in so being they are abroad and not at
				   home, but all going home: Ephesians 3:15, "Of whom the whole family in
				   heaven and earth is named." Heaven is the place that God has built for
				   himself and his children. God has many children, and the place designed
				   for them is heaven; therefore the saints, being the children of God,
				   are said to be of the household of God, Ephesians 2:19: "Now therefore
				   ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the
				   saints, and of the household of God." God is represented as a
				   householder or head of a family, and heaven is his house.
				
				   Heaven is the house not only where God hath his throne, but also where
				   he doth as it were keep his table, where his children sit down with him
				   at his table and where they are feasted in a royal manner becoming the
				   children of so great a King: Luke 22:30, "That ye may eat and drink at
				   my table in my kingdom;" Matthew 26:29, "But I say unto you, I will not
				   drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink
				   it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
				
				   God is the King of kings, and heaven is the place where he keeps his
				   court. There are his angels and archangels that as the nobles of his
				   court do attend upon him.
				
				   Prop. II. There are many mansions in the house of God. By many mansions
				   is meant many seats or places of abode. As it is a king's palace, there
				   are many mansions. Kings' houses are wont to be built very large, with
				   many stately rooms and apartments. So there are many mansions in God's
				   house.
				
				   When this is spoken of heaven, it is chiefly to be understood in a
				   figurative sense, and the following things seem to be taught us in it.
				
				   1. There is room in this house of God for great numbers. There is room
				   in heaven for a vast multitude, yea, room enough for all mankind that
				   are or ever shall be; Luke 14:22, "Lord it is done as thou hast
				   commanded, and yet there is room."
				
				   It is not with the heavenly temple as it often is with houses of public
				   worship in this world, that they fill up and become too small and
				   scanty for those that would meet in them, so that there is not
				   convenient room for all. There is room enough in our heavenly Father's
				   house. This is partly what Christ intended in the words of the text, as
				   is evident from the occasion of his speaking them. The disciples
				   manifested a great desire to be where Christ was, and Christ therefore,
				   to encourage them that it should be as they desired, tells them that in
				   his Father's house where he was going were many mansions, i.e., room
				   enough for them.
				
				   There is mercy enough in God to admit an innumerable multitude into
				   heaven. There is mercy enough for all, and there is merit enough in
				   Christ to purchase heavenly happiness for millions of millions, for all
				   men that ever were, are or shall be. And there is a sufficiency in the
				   fountain of heaven's happiness to supply and fill and satisfy all: and
				   there is in all respects enough for the happiness of all.
				
				   2. There are sufficient and suitable accommodations for all the
				   different sorts of persons that are in the world: for great and small,
				   for high and low, rich and poor, wise and unwise, bond and free,
				   persons of all nations and all conditions and circumstances, for those
				   that have been great sinners as well as for moral livers; for weak
				   saints and those that are babes in Christ as well as for those that are
				   stronger and more grown in grace. There is in heaven a sufficiency for
				   the happiness of every sort; there is a convenient accommodation for
				   every creature that will hearken to the calls of the Gospel. None that
				   will come to Christ, let his condition be what it will, need to fear
				   but that Christ will provide a place suitable for him in heaven.
				
				   This seems to be another thing implied in Christ's words. The disciples
				   were persons of very different condition from Christ: he was their
				   Master, and there were his disciples; he was their Lord, and there were
				   the servants; he was their Guide, and they were the followers; he was
				   their Captain, and they the soldiers; he was the Shepherd, and they the
				   sheep; [he was, as it were, the] Father, [and they the] children; he
				   was the glorious, holy Son of God, they were the poor, sinful, corrupt
				   men. But yet, though they were in such different circumstances from
				   him, yet Christ encourages them that there shall not only be room in
				   heaven for him, but for them too; for there were many mansions there.
				   There was not only a mansion to accommodate the Lord, but the disciples
				   also; not only the head, but the members; not only the Son of God, but
				   those that are naturally poor, sinful, corrupt men: as in a king's
				   palace there is not only a mansion or room of state built for the king
				   himself and for his eldest son and heir, but there are many rooms,
				   mansions for all his numerous household, children, attendants and
				   servants.
				
				   3. It is further implied that heaven is a house that was actually built
				   and prepared for a great multitude. When God made heaven in the
				   beginning of the world, he intended it for an everlasting
				   dwelling-place for a vast and innumerable multitude. When heaven was
				   made , it was intended and prepared for all those particular persons
				   that God had from eternity designed to save: Matthew 25:34, "Come, ye
				   blessed [of my Father, inherit the Kingdom] prepared for you [from the
				   foundation of the world]." And that is a very great and innumerable
				   multitude: Revelation 7:9, "After this I beheld, and, lo, a great
				   multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and
				   peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne and before the Lamb,
				   clothed with white robes." Heaven being built designedly for these was
				   built accordingly; it was built so as most conveniently to accommodate
				   all this multitude: as a house that is built for a great family is
				   built large and with many rooms in it; as a palace that is built for a
				   great king that keeps a great court with many attendants is built
				   exceeding great with a great many apartments; and as an house of public
				   worship that is built for a great congregation is built very large with
				   many seats in it.
				
				   4. When it is said, ["In my father's house are many mansions"], it is
				   meant that there are seats of various dignity and different degrees and
				   circumstances of honor and happiness. There are many mansions in God's
				   house because heaven is intended for various degrees of honor and
				   blessedness. Some are designed to sit in higher places there than
				   others; some are designed to be advanced to higher degrees of honor and
				   glory than others are; and, therefore, there are various mansions, and
				   some more honorable mansions and seats, in heaven than others. Though
				   they are all seats of exceeding honor and blessedness yet some are more
				   so than others.
				
				   Thus a palace is built. Though every part of the palace is magnificent
				   as becomes the palace of a king, yet there are many apartments of
				   various honor, and some are more stately and costly than others,
				   according to the degree of dignity. There is one apartment that is the
				   king's presence-chamber; there are other apartments for the next heir
				   to the crown; there are others for other children; and others for their
				   attendants and the great officers of the household: one for the high
				   steward, and another for the chamberlain, and others for meaner
				   officers and servants.
				
				   Another image of this was in Solomon's temple. There were many mansions
				   of different degrees of honor and dignity. There was the holy of
				   holies, where the ark was that was the place of God's immediate
				   residence, where the high priest alone might come; and there was
				   another apartment called the holy place, where the other priests might
				   come; and next to that was the inner court of the temple, where the
				   Levites were admitted: and there they had many chambers or mansions
				   built for lodging-rooms for the priests; and next to that was the court
				   of Israel where the people of Israel might come; and next to that was
				   the court of the Gentiles where the Gentiles, those that were called
				   the "Proselytes of the Gate," might come.
				
				   And we have an image of this in houses built for the worship of
				   Christian assemblies. In such houses of God there are many seats of
				   different honor and dignity, from the most honorable to the most
				   inferior of the congregation.
				
				   Not that we are to understand the words of Christ so much in a literal
				   sense, as that every saint in heaven was to have a certain seat or room
				   or place of abode where he was to be locally fixed. 'Tis not the design
				   of the Scriptures to inform us much about the external circumstances of
				   heaven or the state of heaven locally considered; but we are to
				   understand what Christ says chiefly in a spiritual sense. Persons shall
				   be set in different degrees of honor and glory in heaven, as is
				   abundantly manifested in Scripture: which may fitly be represented to
				   our imaginations by there being different seats of honor, as it was in
				   the temple, as it is in kings' courts. Some seats shall be nearer the
				   throne than others. Some shall sit next to Christ in glory: Matthew
				   20:23, "To sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give,
				   but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father."
				
				   Christ has doubtless respect to these different degrees of glory in the
				   text. When he was going to heaven and the disciples were sorrowful at
				   the thoughts of parting with their Lord, he lets them know that there
				   are seats or mansions of various degrees of honor in his Father's
				   house, that there was not only one for him, who was the Head of the
				   Church and the elder brother, but also for them that were his disciples
				   and younger brethren.
				
				   Christ also may probably have respect not only to different degrees of
				   glory in heaven, but different circumstances. Though the employment and
				   happiness of all the heavenly assembly shall in the general be the
				   same, yet 'tis not improbable that there may be circumstantial
				   difference. We know what their employment [is] in general, but not in
				   particular. We know not how one may be employed to subserve and promote
				   the happiness of another, and all to help one another. Some may there
				   be set in one place for one office or employment, and others [in]
				   another, as 'tis in the Church on earth. God hath set every one in the
				   body as it hath pleased him; one is the eye, another the ear, another
				   the head, etc. But because God has not been pleased expressly to reveal
				   how it shall be in this respect, therefore I shall not insist upon it,
				   but pass to make some
				
				IMPROVEMENT of what has been offered.
				
				   I. Here is encouragement for sinners that are concerned and exercised
				   for the salvation of their souls, such as are afraid that they shall
				   never go to heaven or be admitted to any place of abode there, and are
				   sensible that they are hitherto in a doleful state and condition in
				   that they are out of Christ, and so have no right to any inheritance in
				   heaven, but are in danger of going to hell and having their place of
				   eternal abode fixed there. You may be encouraged by what has been said,
				   earnestly to seek heaven; for there are many mansions there. There is
				   room enough there. Let your case be what it will, there is suitable
				   provision there for you; and if you come to Christ, you need not fear
				   that he will prepare a place for you; he'll see to it that you shall be
				   well accommodated in heaven.
				
				   But II. I would improve this doctrine in a twofold exhortation.
				
				   1. Let all be hence exhorted earnestly to seek that they may be
				   admitted to a mansion in heaven. You have heard that this is God's
				   house; it is his temple. If David, when he was in the wilderness of
				   Judah and in the land of Geshur and of the Philistines, so longed that
				   he might again return into the land of Israel that he might have a
				   place in the house of God here on earth, and prized a place there so
				   much, though it was but that of a door-keeper, how great a happiness
				   will it be to have a place in this heavenly temple of God! If they are
				   looked upon as enjoying a high privilege that have a seat appointed
				   them in kings' courts or in apartments in kings' palaces, especially
				   those that have an abode there in the quality of the king's children,
				   then how great a privilege will it be to have an apartment or mansion
				   assigned to us in God's heavenly palace, and to have a place there as
				   his children! How great is their glory and honor that are admitted to
				   be of the household of God!
				
				   And seeing there are many mansions there, mansions enough for us all,
				   our folly will be the greater if we neglect to seek a place in heaven,
				   having our minds foolishly taken up about the worthless, fading things
				   of this world. Here consider three things:
				
				   (1) How little a while you can have any mansion or place of abode in
				   this world. Now you have a dwelling amongst the living. You have a
				   house or mansion of your own, or at least one that is at present for
				   your use, and now you have a seat in the house of God; but how little a
				   while will this continue! In a very little while, and the place that
				   now knows you in this world will know you no more. The habitation you
				   have here will be empty of you; you will be carried dead out of it, or
				   shall die at a distance from it, and never enter into it any more, or
				   into any other abode in this world. Your mansion or place of abode in
				   this world, however convenient or commodious it may be, is but as a
				   tent that shall soon be taken down, but a lodge in a garden of
				   cucumbers. Your stay is as it were but for a night. Your body itself is
				   but a house of clay which will quickly moulder and tumble down, and you
				   shall have no other habitation here in this world but the grave.
				
				   Thus God in his providence is putting you in mind by the repeated
				   instances of death that have been in the town within the two weeks
				   past, both in one house: in which death he has shown his dominion over
				   old and young. The son was taken away first before the father, being in
				   his full strength and flower of his days; and the father, who was then
				   well and having no appearance of approaching death, followed in a few
				   days: and their habitation and their seat in the house of God in this
				   world will know them no more.
				
				   Take warning by these warnings of Providence to improve your time that
				   you may have a mansion in heaven. We have a house of worship newly
				   created amongst us which now you have a seat in, and probably are
				   pleased with the ornaments of it; and though you have a place in so
				   comely a house, yet you know not how little a while you shall have a
				   place in this house of God. Here are a couple snatched away by death
				   that had met in it but a few times, that have been snatched out of it
				   before it was fully finished and never will have any more a seat in it.
				   You know not how soon you may follow, and then of great importance will
				   it be to you to have a seat in God's house above. Both of the persons
				   lately deceased were much on their death-beds warning others to improve
				   their precious time. The first of them was much in expressing his sense
				   of the vast importance of an interest in Christ, as I was a witness,
				   and was earnest in calling on others to improve their time, to be
				   thorough, to get an interest in Christ, and seemed very desirous that
				   young people might receive council and warning from him, as the words
				   of a dying man, to do their utmost to make sure of conversion; and a
				   little before he died left a request to me that I would warn the young
				   people in his room. God had been warning of you in his death and the
				   death of his father that so soon followed. The words of dying persons
				   should be of special weight with us, for then they are in circumstances
				   wherein they are most capable to look on things as they are and judge
				   aright of 'em,--between both worlds as it were. Still that we must all
				   be in.
				
				   Let our young people, therefore, take warning from hence, and don't be
				   such fools as to neglect seeking a place and mansion in heaven. Young
				   persons are especially apt to be taken with the pleasing things of this
				   world. You are now, it may be, much pleased with hopes of your future
				   circumstances in this world; [and you are now, it may be, much] pleased
				   with the ornaments of that house of worship that you with others have a
				   place in. But, alas, do you not too little consider how soon you may be
				   taken away from all these things, and no more forever have any part in
				   any mansion or house or enjoyment or happiness under the sun? Therefore
				   let it be your main care to secure an everlasting habitation for
				   hereafter.
				
				   (2) Consider when you die, if you have no mansion in the house of God
				   in heaven, you must have your place of abode in the habitation of
				   devils. There is no middle place between them, and when you go hence,
				   you must go to one or the other of these. Some have a mansion prepared
				   for them in heaven from the foundation [of the world]; others are sent
				   away as cursed into everlasting burnings prepared for the [devil and
				   his angels]. Consider how miserable those must be that shall have their
				   habitation with devils to all eternity. Devils are foul spirits; God's
				   great enemies. Their habitation is the blackness of darkness; a place
				   of the utmost filthiness, abomination, darkness, disgrace and torment,
				   O, how would you rather ten thousand times have no place of abode at
				   all, have no being, than to have a place [with devils]!
				
				   (3) If you die unconverted, you will have the worse place in hell for
				   having had a seat or place in God's house in this world. As there are
				   many mansions, places of different degrees of honor in heaven, so there
				   are various abodes and places or degrees of torment and misery in hell;
				   and those will have the worst place there that [dying unconverted, have
				   had the best place in God's house here]. Solomon speaks of a peculiarly
				   awful sight that he had seen, that of a wicked man buried that had gone
				   [from the place of the holy], Ecclesiastes 8:10. Such as have had a
				   seat in God's house, have been in a sense exalted up to heaven, set on
				   the gate of heaven, [if they die unconverted, shall be] cast down to
				   hell.
				
				   2. The second exhortation that I would offer from what has been said is
				   to seek a high place in heaven. Seeing there are many mansions of
				   different degrees of honor and dignity in heaven, let us seek to obtain
				   a mansion of distinguished glory. 'Tis revealed to us that there are
				   different degrees of glory to that end that we might seek after the
				   higher degrees. God offered high degrees of glory to that end, that we
				   might seek them by eminent holiness and good works: 2 Corinthians 9:6,
				   "He that sows sparingly [shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth
				   bountifully shall reap also bountifully]." It is not becoming persons
				   to be over anxious about an high seat in God's house in this world, for
				   that is the honor that is of men; but we can't too earnestly seek after
				   an high seat in God's house above, by seeking eminent holiness, for
				   that is the honor that is of God.
				
				   'Tis very little worth the while for us to pursue after honor in this
				   world, where the greatest honor is but a bubble and will soon vanish
				   away, and death will level all. Some have more stately houses than
				   others, and some are in higher office than others, and some are richer
				   than others and have higher seats in the meeting-house than others; but
				   all graves are upon a level. One rotting, putrefying corpse is as
				   ignoble as another; the worms are as bold with one carcass as another.
				
				   But the mansions in God's house above are everlasting mansions. Those
				   that have seats allotted 'em there, whether of greater or lesser
				   dignity, whether nearer or further from the throne, will hold 'em to
				   all eternity. This is promised, Revelation 3:12 :"Him that overcometh I
				   will make him a pillar in the temple [of my God, and he shall go no
				   more out]." If it be worth the while to desire and seek high seats in
				   the meeting-house, where you are one day in a week, and where you shall
				   never come but few days in all; if it be worth the while much to prize
				   one seat above another in the house of worship only because it is the
				   pew or seat that is ranked first in number, and to be seen here for a
				   few days, how will it be worth the while to seek an high mansion in
				   God's temple and in that glorious place that is the everlasting
				   habitation of God and all his children! You that are pleased with your
				   seats in this house because you are seated high or in a place that is
				   looked upon honorable by those that sit round about, and because many
				   can behold you, consider how short a time you will enjoy this pleasure.
				   And if there be any that are not suited in their seats because they are
				   too low for them, let them consider that it is but a very little while
				   before it will [be] all one to you whether you have sat high or low
				   here. But it will be of infinite and everlasting concern to you where
				   your seat is in another world. Let your great concern be while in this
				   world so to improve your opportunities in God's house in this world,
				   whether you sit high or low, as that you may have a distinguished and
				   glorious mansion in God's house in heaven, where you may be fixed in
				   your place in that glorious assembly in an everlasting rest.
				
				   Let the main thing that we prize in God's house be, not the outward
				   ornaments of it, or a high seat in it, but the word of God and his
				   ordinances in it. And spend your time here in seeking Christ, that he
				   may prepare a place for you in his Father's house, that when he comes
				   again to this world, he may take you to himself, that where he is,
				   there you may be also.
