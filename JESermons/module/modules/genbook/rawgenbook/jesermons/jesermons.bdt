					Their foot shall slide in due time. <reference osisRef="Deut.32.35">Deuteronomy 32:35</reference>
				</p><p>
				   In this verse is threatened the vengeance of God on the wicked
				   unbelieving Israelites, who were God's visible people, and who lived
				   under the means of grace; but who, notwithstanding all God's wonderful
				   works towards them, remained (as vers 28.) void of counsel, having no
				   understanding in them. Under all the cultivations of heaven, they
				   brought forth bitter and poisonous fruit; as in the two verses next
				   preceding the text. - The expression I have chosen for my text, their
				   foot shall slide in due time, seems to imply the following things,
				   relating to the punishment and destruction to which these wicked
				   Israelites were exposed.
				</p><p>
				    1. That they were always exposed to destruction; as one that stands or
				       walks in slippery places is always exposed to fall. This is implied
				       in the manner of their destruction coming upon them, being
				       represented by their foot sliding. The same is expressed, <reference osisRef="Ps.73.18">Psalms 73:18</reference>. "Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou
				       castedst them down into destruction."
				</p><p>
				    2. It implies, that they were always exposed to sudden unexpected
				       destruction. As he that walks in slippery places is every moment
				       liable to fall, he cannot foresee one moment whether he shall stand
				       or fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once without
				       warning: Which is also expressed in <reference osisRef="Ps.73.18 Ps.73.19">Psalms 73:18-19</reference>. "Surely thou
				       didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into
				       destruction: How are they brought into desolation as in a moment!"
				</p><p>
				    3. Another thing implied is, that they are liable to fall of
				       themselves, without being thrown down by the hand of another; as he
				       that stands or walks on slippery ground needs nothing but his own
				       weight to throw him down.
				</p><p>
				    4. That the reason why they are not fallen already and do not fall now
				       is only that God's appointed time is not come. For it is said, that
				       when that due time, or appointed time comes, their foot shall
				       slide. Then they shall be left to fall, as they are inclined by
				       their own weight. God will not hold them up in these slippery
				       places any longer, but will let them go; and then, at that very
				       instant, they shall fall into destruction; as he that stands on
				       such slippery declining ground, on the edge of a pit, he cannot
				       stand alone, when he is let go he immediately falls and is lost.
				</p><p>
				   The observation from the words that I would now insist upon is this. -
				   "There is nothing that keeps wicked men at any one moment out of hell,
				   but the mere pleasure of God." - By the mere pleasure of God, I mean
				   his sovereign pleasure, his arbitrary will, restrained by no
				   obligation, hindered by no manner of difficulty, any more than if
				   nothing else but God's mere will had in the least degree, or in any
				   respect whatsoever, any hand in the preservation of wicked men one
				   moment. - The truth of this observation may appear by the following
				   consideration.
				</p><p>
				    1. There is no want of power in God to cast wicked men into hell at
				       any moment. Men's hands cannot be strong when God rises up. The
				       strongest have no power to resist him, nor can any deliver out of
				       his hands. - He is not only able to cast wicked men into hell, but
				       he can most easily do it. Sometimes an earthly prince meets with a
				       great deal of difficulty to subdue a rebel, who has found means to
				       fortify himself, and has made himself strong by the numbers of his
				       followers. But it is not so with God. There is no fortress that is
				       any defence from the power of God. Though hand join in hand, and
				       vast multitudes of God's enemies combine and associate themselves,
				       they are easily broken in pieces. They are as great heaps of light
				       chaff before the whirlwind; or large quantities of dry stubble
				       before devouring flames. We find it easy to tread on and crush a
				       worm that we see crawling on the earth; so it is easy for us to cut
				       or singe a slender thread that any thing hangs by: thus easy is it
				       for God, when he pleases, to cast his enemies down to hell. What
				       are we, that we should think to stand before him, at whose rebuke
				       the earth trembles, and before whom the rocks are thrown down?
				</p><p>
				    2. They deserve to be cast into hell; so that divine justice never
				       stands in the way, it makes no objection against God's using his
				       power at any moment to destroy them. Yea, on the contrary, justice
				       calls aloud for an infinite punishment of their sins. Divine
				       justice says of the tree that brings forth such grapes of Sodom,
				       "Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?" <reference osisRef="Luke.13.7">Luke 13:7</reference>. The sword of
				       divine justice is every moment brandished over their heads, and it
				       is nothing but the hand of arbitrary mercy, and God's mere will,
				       that holds it back.
				</p><p>
				    3. They are already under a sentence of condemnation to hell. They do
				       not only justly deserve to be cast down thither, but the sentence
				       of the law of God, that eternal and immutable rule of righteousness
				       that God has fixed between him and mankind, is gone out against
				       them, and stands against them; so that they are bound over already
				       to hell. <reference osisRef="John.3.18">John 3:18</reference>. "He that believeth not is condemned already."
				       So that every unconverted man properly belongs to hell; that is his
				       place; from thence he is, <reference osisRef="John.8.23">John 8:23</reference>. "Ye are from beneath:" And
				       thither he is bound; it is the place that justice, and God's word,
				       and the sentence of his unchangeable law assign to him.
				</p><p>
				    4. They are now the objects of that very same anger and wrath of God,
				       that is expressed in the torments of hell. And the reason why they
				       do not go down to hell at each moment, is not because God, in whose
				       power they are, is not then very angry with them; as he is with
				       many miserable creatures now tormented in hell, who there feel and
				       bear the fierceness of his wrath. Yea, God is a great deal more
				       angry with great numbers that are now on earth: yea, doubtless,
				       with many that are now in this congregation, who it may be are at
				       ease, than he is with many of those who are now in the flames of
				       hell.
				       So that it is not because God is unmindful of their wickedness, and
				       does not resent it, that he does not let loose his hand and cut
				       them off. God is not altogether such an one as themselves, though
				       they may imagine him to be so. The wrath of God burns against them,
				       their damnation does not slumber; the pit is prepared, the fire is
				       made ready, the furnace is now hot, ready to receive them; the
				       flames do now rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet, and held
				       over them, and the pit hath opened its mouth under them.
				</p><p>
				    5. The devil stands ready to fall upon them, and seize them as his
				       own, at what moment God shall permit him. They belong to him; he
				       has their souls in his possession, and under his dominion. The
				       scripture represents them as his goods, <reference osisRef="Luke.11.12">Luke 11:12</reference>. The devils
				       watch them; they are ever by them at their right hand; they stand
				       waiting for them, like greedy hungry lions that see their prey, and
				       expect to have it, but are for the present kept back. If God should
				       withdraw his hand, by which they are restrained, they would in one
				       moment fly upon their poor souls. The old serpent is gaping for
				       them; hell opens its mouth wide to receive them; and if God should
				       permit it, they would be hastily swallowed up and lost.
				</p><p>
				    6. There are in the souls of wicked men those hellish principles
				       reigning, that would presently kindle and flame out into hell fire,
				       if it were not for God's restraints. There is laid in the very
				       nature of carnal men, a foundation for the torments of hell. There
				       are those corrupt principles, in reigning power in them, and in
				       full possession of them, that are seeds of hell fire. These
				       principles are active and powerful, exceeding violent in their
				       nature, and if it were not for the restraining hand of God upon
				       them, they would soon break out, they would flame out after the
				       same manner as the same corruptions, the same enmity does in the
				       hearts of damned souls, and would beget the same torments as they
				       do in them. The souls of the wicked are in scripture compared to
				       the troubled sea, <reference osisRef="Isa.57.20">Isaiah 57:20</reference>. For the present, God restrains their
				       wickedness by his mighty power, as he does the raging waves of the
				       troubled sea, saying, "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further;"
				       but if God should withdraw that restraining power, it would soon
				       carry all before it. Sin is the ruin and misery of the soul; it is
				       destructive in its nature; and if God should leave it without
				       restraint, there would need nothing else to make the soul perfectly
				       miserable. The corruption of the heart of man is immoderate and
				       boundless in its fury; and while wicked men live here, it is like
				       fire pent up by God's restraints, whereas if it were let loose, it
				       would set on fire the course of nature; and as the heart is now a
				       sink of sin, so if sin was not restrained, it would immediately
				       turn the soul into fiery oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone.
				</p><p>
				    7. It is no security to wicked men for one moment, that there are no
				       visible means of death at hand. It is no security to a natural man,
				       that he is now in health, and that he does not see which way he
				       should now immediately go out of the world by any accident, and
				       that there is no visible danger in any respect in his
				       circumstances. The manifold and continual experience of the world
				       in all ages, shows this is no evidence, that a man is not on the
				       very brink of eternity, and that the next step will not be into
				       another world. The unseen, unthought-of ways and means of persons
				       going suddenly out of the world are innumerable and inconceivable.
				       Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering, and
				       there are innumerable places in this covering so weak that they
				       will not bear their weight, and these places are not seen. The
				       arrows of death fly unseen at noon-day; the sharpest sight cannot
				       discern them. God has so many different unsearchable ways of taking
				       wicked men out of the world and sending them to hell, that there is
				       nothing to make it appear, that God had need to be at the expense
				       of a miracle, or go out of the ordinary course of his providence,
				       to destroy any wicked man, at any moment. All the means that there
				       are of sinners going out of the world, are so in God's hands, and
				       so universally and absolutely subject to his power and
				       determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere
				       will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than
				       if means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.
				</p><p>
				    8. Natural men's prudence and care to preserve their own lives, or the
				       care of others to preserve them, do not secure them a moment. To
				       this, divine providence and universal experience do also bear
				       testimony. There is this clear evidence that men's own wisdom is no
				       security to them from death; that if it were otherwise we should
				       see some difference between the wise and politic men of the world,
				       and others, with regard to their liableness to early and unexpected
				       death: but how is it in fact? <reference osisRef="Eccl.2.16">Ecclesiastes 2:16</reference>. "How dieth the wise
				       man? even as the fool."
				</p><p>
				    9. All wicked men's pains and contrivance which they use to escape
				       hell, while they continue to reject Christ, and so remain wicked
				       men, do not secure them from hell one moment. Almost every natural
				       man that hears of hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it;
				       he depends upon himself for his own security; he flatters himself
				       in what he has done, in what he is now doing, or what he intends to
				       do. Every one lays out matters in his own mind how he shall avoid
				       damnation, and flatters himself that he contrives well for himself,
				       and that his schemes will not fail. They hear indeed that there are
				       but few saved, and that the greater part of men that have died
				       heretofore are gone to hell; but each one imagines that he lays out
				       matters better for his own escape than others have done. He does
				       not intend to come to that place of torment; he says within
				       himself, that he intends to take effectual care, and to order
				       matters so for himself as not to fail.
				       But the foolish children of men miserably delude themselves in
				       their own schemes, and in confidence in their own strength and
				       wisdom; they trust to nothing but a shadow. The greater part of
				       those who heretofore have lived under the same means of grace, and
				       are now dead, are undoubtedly gone to hell; and it was not because
				       they were not as wise as those who are now alive: it was not
				       because they did not lay out matters as well for themselves to
				       secure their own escape. If we could speak with them, and inquire
				       of them, one by one, whether they expected, when alive, and when
				       they used to hear about hell, ever to be the subjects of misery: we
				       doubtless, should hear one and another reply, "No, I never intended
				       to come here: I had laid out matters otherwise in my mind; I
				       thought I should contrive well for myself - I thought my scheme
				       good. I intended to take effectual care; but it came upon me
				       unexpected; I did not look for it at that time, and in that manner;
				       it came as a thief - Death outwitted me: God's wrath was too quick
				       for me. Oh, my cursed foolishness! I was flattering myself, and
				       pleasing myself with vain dreams of what I would do hereafter; and
				       when I was saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction came
				       upon me."
				</p><p>
				   10. God has laid himself under no obligation, by any promise to keep
				       any natural man out of hell one moment. God certainly has made no
				       promises either of eternal life, or of any deliverance or
				       preservation from eternal death, but what are contained in the
				       covenant of grace, the promises that are given in Christ, in whom
				       all the promises are yea and amen. But surely they have no interest
				       in the promises of the covenant of grace who are not the children
				       of the covenant, who do not believe in any of the promises, and
				       have no interest in the Mediator of the covenant.
				</p><p>
				   So that, whatever some have imagined and pretended about promises made
				   to natural men's earnest seeking and knocking, it is plain and
				   manifest, that whatever pains a natural man takes in religion, whatever
				   prayers he makes, till he believes in Christ, God is under no manner of
				   obligation to keep him a moment from eternal destruction.
				</p><p>
				   So that, thus it is that natural men are held in the hand of God, over
				   the pit of hell; they have deserved the fiery pit, and are already
				   sentenced to it; and God is dreadfully provoked, his anger is as great
				   towards them as to those that are actually suffering the executions of
				   the fierceness of his wrath in hell, and they have done nothing in the
				   least to appease or abate that anger, neither is God in the least bound
				   by any promise to hold them up one moment; the devil is waiting for
				   them, hell is gaping for them, the flames gather and flash about them,
				   and would fain lay hold on them, and swallow them up; the fire pent up
				   in their own hearts is struggling to break out: and they have no
				   interest in any Mediator, there are no means within reach that can be
				   any security to them. In short, they have no refuge, nothing to take
				   hold of; all that preserves them every moment is the mere arbitrary
				   will, and uncovenanted, unobliged forbearance of an incensed God.
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">Application</hi>
				</p><p>
				   The use of this awful subject may be for awakening unconverted persons
				   in this congregation. This that you have heard is the case of every one
				   of you that are out of Christ. - That world of misery, that lake of
				   burning brimstone, is extended abroad under you. There is the dreadful
				   pit of the glowing flames of the wrath of God; there is hell's wide
				   gaping mouth open; and you have nothing to stand upon, nor any thing to
				   take hold of; there is nothing between you and hell but the air; it is
				   only the power and mere pleasure of God that holds you up.
				</p><p>
				   You probably are not sensible of this; you find you are kept out of
				   hell, but do not see the hand of God in it; but look at other things,
				   as the good state of your bodily constitution, your care of your own
				   life, and the means you use for your own preservation. But indeed these
				   things are nothing; if God should withdraw his hand, they would avail
				   no more to keep you from falling, than the thin air to hold up a person
				   that is suspended in it.
				</p><p>
				   Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend
				   downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God
				   should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and
				   plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and
				   your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your
				   righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you
				   out of hell, than a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock.
				   Were it not for the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not bear
				   you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans with
				   you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your corruption,
				   not willingly; the sun does not willingly shine upon you to give you
				   light to serve sin and Satan; the earth does not willingly yield her
				   increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage for your
				   wickedness to be acted upon; the air does not willingly serve you for
				   breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you spend
				   your life in the service of God's enemies. God's creatures are good,
				   and were made for men to serve God with, and do not willingly subserve
				   to any other purpose, and groan when they are abused to purposes so
				   directly contrary to their nature and end. And the world would spew you
				   out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath subjected it in
				   hope. There are the black clouds of God's wrath now hanging directly
				   over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big with thunder; and
				   were it not for the restraining hand of God, it would immediately burst
				   forth upon you. The sovereign pleasure of God, for the present, stays
				   his rough wind; otherwise it would come with fury, and your destruction
				   would come like a whirlwind, and you would be like the chaff on the
				   summer threshing floor.
				</p><p>
				   The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present;
				   they increase more and more, and rise higher and higher, till an outlet
				   is given; and the longer the stream is stopped, the more rapid and
				   mighty is its course, when once it is let loose. It is true, that
				   judgment against your evil works has not been executed hitherto; the
				   floods of God's vengeance have been withheld; but your guilt in the
				   mean time is constantly increasing, and you are every day treasuring up
				   more wrath; the waters are constantly rising, and waxing more and more
				   mighty; and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, that holds
				   the waters back, that are unwilling to be stopped, and press hard to go
				   forward. If God should only withdraw his hand from the flood-gate, it
				   would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and
				   wrath of God, would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come
				   upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength were ten thousand
				   times greater than it is, yea, ten thousand times greater than the
				   strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it would be nothing
				   to withstand or endure it.
				</p><p>
				   The bow of God's wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string,
				   and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it
				   is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an angry God,
				   without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the arrow one
				   moment from being made drunk with your blood. Thus all you that never
				   passed under a great change of heart, by the mighty power of the Spirit
				   of God upon your souls; all you that were never born again, and made
				   new creatures, and raised from being dead in sin, to a state of new,
				   and before altogether unexperienced light and life, are in the hands of
				   an angry God. However you may have reformed your life in many things,
				   and may have had religious affections, and may keep up a form of
				   religion in your families and closets, and in the house of God, it is
				   nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being this moment
				   swallowed up in everlasting destruction. However unconvinced you may
				   now be of the truth of what you hear, by and by you will be fully
				   convinced of it. Those that are gone from being in the like
				   circumstances with you, see that it was so with them; for destruction
				   came suddenly upon most of them; when they expected nothing of it, and
				   while they were saying, Peace and safety: now they see, that those
				   things on which they depended for peace and safety, were nothing but
				   thin air and empty shadows.
				</p><p>
				   The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a
				   spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is
				   dreadfully provoked: his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks
				   upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire; he is
				   of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight; you are ten
				   thousand times more abominable in his eyes, than the most hateful
				   venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more than
				   ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but his
				   hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment. It is to
				   be ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell the last
				   night; that you was suffered to awake again in this world, after you
				   closed your eyes to sleep. And there is no other reason to be given,
				   why you have not dropped into hell since you arose in the morning, but
				   that God's hand has held you up. There is no other reason to be given
				   why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat here in the house of
				   God, provoking his pure eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending
				   his solemn worship. Yea, there is nothing else that is to be given as a
				   reason why you do not this very moment drop down into hell.
				</p><p>
				   O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great furnace
				   of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that
				   you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and
				   incensed as much against you, as against many of the damned in hell.
				   You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing
				   about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; and
				   you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to
				   save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your
				   own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to
				   induce God to spare you one moment. - And consider here more
				   particularly,
				</p><p>
				    1. Whose wrath it is: it is the wrath of the infinite God. If it were
				       only the wrath of man, though it were of the most potent prince, it
				       would be comparatively little to be regarded. The wrath of kings is
				       very much dreaded, especially of absolute monarchs, who have the
				       possessions and lives of their subjects wholly in their power, to
				       be disposed of at their mere will. <reference osisRef="Prov.20.2">Proverbs 20:2</reference>. "The fear of a king
				       is as the roaring of a lion: Whoso provoketh him to anger, sinneth
				       against his own soul." The subject that very much enrages an
				       arbitrary prince, is liable to suffer the most extreme torments
				       that human art can invent, or human power can inflict. But the
				       greatest earthly potentates in their greatest majesty and strength,
				       and when clothed in their greatest terrors, are but feeble,
				       despicable worms of the dust, in comparison of the great and
				       almighty Creator and King of heaven and earth. It is but little
				       that they can do, when most enraged, and when they have exerted the
				       utmost of their fury. All the kings of the earth, before God, are
				       as grasshoppers; they are nothing, and less than nothing: both
				       their love and their hatred is to be despised. The wrath of the
				       great King of kings, is as much more terrible than theirs, as his
				       majesty is greater. <reference osisRef="Luke.12.4 Luke.12.5">Luke 12:4-5</reference>. "And I say unto you, my friends,
				       Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, have no
				       more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom you shall fear:
				       fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell:
				       yea, I say unto you, Fear him."
				</p><p>
				    2. It is the fierceness of his wrath that you are exposed to. We often
				       read of the fury of God; as in <reference osisRef="Isa.59.18">Isaiah 59:18</reference>. "According to their
				       deeds, accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries." So <reference osisRef="Isa.66.15">Isaiah 66:15</reference>. "For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his
				       chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his
				       rebuke with flames of fire." And in many other places. So, <reference osisRef="Rev.19.15">Revelation of John 19:15</reference>, we read of "the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of
				       Almighty God." The words are exceeding terrible. If it had only
				       been said, "the wrath of God," the words would have implied that
				       which is infinitely dreadful: but it is "the fierceness and wrath
				       of God." The fury of God! the fierceness of Jehovah! Oh, how
				       dreadful that must be! Who can utter or conceive what such
				       expressions carry in them! But it is also "the fierceness and wrath
				       of almighty God." As though there would be a very great
				       manifestation of his almighty power in what the fierceness of his
				       wrath should inflict, as though omnipotence should be as it were
				       enraged, and exerted, as men are wont to exert their strength in
				       the fierceness of their wrath. Oh! then, what will be the
				       consequence! What will become of the poor worms that shall suffer
				       it! Whose hands can be strong? And whose heart can endure? To what
				       a dreadful, inexpressible, inconceivable depth of misery must the
				       poor creature be sunk who shall be the subject of this!
				       Consider this, you that are here present, that yet remain in an
				       unregenerate state. That God will execute the fierceness of his
				       anger, implies, that he will inflict wrath without any pity. When
				       God beholds the ineffable extremity of your case, and sees your
				       torment to be so vastly disproportioned to your strength, and sees
				       how your poor soul is crushed, and sinks down, as it were, into an
				       infinite gloom; he will have no compassion upon you, he will not
				       forbear the executions of his wrath, or in the least lighten his
				       hand; there shall be no moderation or mercy, nor will God then at
				       all stay his rough wind; he will have no regard to your welfare,
				       nor be at all careful lest you should suffer too much in any other
				       sense, than only that you shall not suffer beyond what strict
				       justice requires. Nothing shall be withheld, because it is so hard
				       for you to bear. <reference osisRef="Ezek.8.18">Ezekiel 8:18</reference>. "Therefore will I also deal in fury:
				       mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they
				       cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them." Now
				       God stands ready to pity you; this is a day of mercy; you may cry
				       now with some encouragement of obtaining mercy. But when once the
				       day of mercy is past, your most lamentable and dolorous cries and
				       shrieks will be in vain; you will be wholly lost and thrown away of
				       God, as to any regard to your welfare. God will have no other use
				       to put you to, but to suffer misery; you shall be continued in
				       being to no other end; for you will be a vessel of wrath fitted to
				       destruction; and there will be no other use of this vessel, but to
				       be filled full of wrath. God will be so far from pitying you when
				       you cry to him, that it is said he will only "laugh and mock,"
				       <reference osisRef="Prov.1.25 Prov.1.26">Proverbs 1:25-26</reference>,etc.
				       How awful are those words, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.3">Isaiah 63:3</reference>, which are the words of the
				       great God. "I will tread them in mine anger, and will trample them
				       in my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments,
				       and I will stain all my raiment." It is perhaps impossible to
				       conceive of words that carry in them greater manifestations of
				       these three things, viz. contempt, and hatred, and fierceness of
				       indignation. If you cry to God to pity you, he will be so far from
				       pitying you in your doleful case, or showing you the least regard
				       or favour, that instead of that, he will only tread you under foot.
				       And though he will know that you cannot bear the weight of
				       omnipotence treading upon you, yet he will not regard that, but he
				       will crush you under his feet without mercy; he will crush out your
				       blood, and make it fly, and it shall be sprinkled on his garments,
				       so as to stain all his raiment. He will not only hate you, but he
				       will have you in the utmost contempt: no place shall be thought fit
				       for you, but under his feet to be trodden down as the mire of the
				       streets.
				</p><p>
				    3. The misery you are exposed to is that which God will inflict to
				       that end, that he might show what that wrath of Jehovah is. God
				       hath had it on his heart to show to angels and men, both how
				       excellent his love is, and also how terrible his wrath is.
				       Sometimes earthly kings have a mind to show how terrible their
				       wrath is, by the extreme punishments they would execute on those
				       that would provoke them. Nebuchadnezzar, that mighty and haughty
				       monarch of the Chaldean empire, was willing to show his wrath when
				       enraged with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and accordingly gave
				       orders that the burning fiery furnace should be heated seven times
				       hotter than it was before; doubtless, it was raised to the utmost
				       degree of fierceness that human art could raise it. But the great
				       God is also willing to show his wrath, and magnify his awful
				       majesty and mighty power in the extreme sufferings of his enemies.
				       <reference osisRef="Rom.9.22">Romans 9:22</reference>. "What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his
				       power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath
				       fitted to destruction?" And seeing this is his design, and what he
				       has determined, even to show how terrible the unrestrained wrath,
				       the fury and fierceness of Jehovah is, he will do it to effect.
				       There will be something accomplished and brought to pass that will
				       be dreadful with a witness. When the great and angry God hath risen
				       up and executed his awful vengeance on the poor sinner, and the
				       wretch is actually suffering the infinite weight and power of his
				       indignation, then will God call upon the whole universe to behold
				       that awful majesty and mighty power that is to be seen in it. <reference osisRef="Isa.33.12 Isa.33.13 Isa.33.14">Isaiah 33:12-14</reference>. "And the people shall be as the burnings of lime, as
				       thorns cut up shall they be burnt in the fire. Hear ye that are far
				       off, what I have done; and ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
				       The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
				       hypocrites," etc.
				       Thus it will be with you that are in an unconverted state, if you
				       continue in it; the infinite might, and majesty, and terribleness
				       of the omnipotent God shall be magnified upon you, in the ineffable
				       strength of your torments. You shall be tormented in the presence
				       of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and when you
				       shall be in this state of suffering, the glorious inhabitants of
				       heaven shall go forth and look on the awful spectacle, that they
				       may see what the wrath and fierceness of the Almighty is; and when
				       they have seen it, they will fall down and adore that great power
				       and majesty. <reference osisRef="Isa.66.23 Isa.66.24">Isaiah 66:23-24</reference>. "And it shall come to pass, that from
				       one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all
				       flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. And they shall go
				       forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed
				       against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire
				       be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."
				</p><p>
				    4. It is everlasting wrath. It would be dreadful to suffer this
				       fierceness and wrath of Almighty God one moment; but you must
				       suffer it to all eternity. There will be no end to this exquisite
				       horrible misery. When you look forward, you shall see a long for
				       ever, a boundless duration before you, which will swallow up your
				       thoughts, and amaze your soul; and you will absolutely despair of
				       ever having any deliverance, any end, any mitigation, any rest at
				       all. You will know certainly that you must wear out long ages,
				       millions of millions of ages, in wrestling and conflicting with
				       this almighty merciless vengeance; and then when you have so done,
				       when so many ages have actually been spent by you in this manner,
				       you will know that all is but a point to what remains. So that your
				       punishment will indeed be infinite. Oh, who can express what the
				       state of a soul in such circumstances is! All that we can possibly
				       say about it, gives but a very feeble, faint representation of it;
				       it is inexpressible and inconceivable: For "who knows the power of
				       God's anger?"
				</p><p>
				</p><p>
				   How dreadful is the state of those that are daily and hourly in the
				   danger of this great wrath and infinite misery! But this is the dismal
				   case of every soul in this congregation that has not been born again,
				   however moral and strict, sober and religious, they may otherwise be.
				   Oh that you would consider it, whether you be young or old! There is
				   reason to think, that there are many in this congregation now hearing
				   this discourse, that will actually be the subjects of this very misery
				   to all eternity. We know not who they are, or in what seats they sit,
				   or what thoughts they now have. It may be they are now at ease, and
				   hear all these things without much disturbance, and are now flattering
				   themselves that they are not the persons, promising themselves that
				   they shall escape. If we knew that there was one person, and but one,
				   in the whole congregation, that was to be the subject of this misery,
				   what an awful thing would it be to think of! If we knew who it was,
				   what an awful sight would it be to see such a person! How might all the
				   rest of the congregation lift up a lamentable and bitter cry over him!
				   But, alas! instead of one, how many is it likely will remember this
				   discourse in hell? And it would be a wonder, if some that are now
				   present should not be in hell in a very short time, even before this
				   year is out. And it would be no wonder if some persons, that now sit
				   here, in some seats of this meeting-house, in health, quiet and secure,
				   should be there before tomorrow morning. Those of you that finally
				   continue in a natural condition, that shall keep out of hell longest
				   will be there in a little time! your damnation does not slumber; it
				   will come swiftly, and, in all probability, very suddenly upon many of
				   you. You have reason to wonder that you are not already in hell. It is
				   doubtless the case of some whom you have seen and known, that never
				   deserved hell more than you, and that heretofore appeared as likely to
				   have been now alive as you. Their case is past all hope; they are
				   crying in extreme misery and perfect despair; but here you are in the
				   land of the living and in the house of God, and have an opportunity to
				   obtain salvation. What would not those poor damned hopeless souls give
				   for one day's opportunity such as you now enjoy!
				</p><p>
				   And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has
				   thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and crying
				   with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to
				   him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily coming from
				   the east, west, north and south; many that were very lately in the same
				   miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with
				   their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them, and washed
				   them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the
				   glory of God. How awful is it to be left behind at such a day! To see
				   so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see so
				   many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to
				   mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit! How can you
				   rest one moment in such a condition? Are not your souls as precious as
				   the souls of the people at Suffield, where they are flocking from day
				   to day to Christ?
				</p><p>
				   Are there not many here who have lived long in the world, and are not
				   to this day born again? and so are aliens from the commonwealth of
				   Israel, and have done nothing ever since they have lived, but treasure
				   up wrath against the day of wrath? Oh, sirs, your case, in an especial
				   manner, is extremely dangerous. Your guilt and hardness of heart is
				   extremely great. Do you not see how generality persons of your years
				   are passed over and left, in the present remarkable and wonderful
				   dispensation of God's mercy? You had need to consider yourselves, and
				   awake thoroughly out of sleep. You cannot bear the fierceness and wrath
				   of the infinite God. - And you, young men, and young women, will you
				   neglect this precious season which you now enjoy, when so many others
				   of your age are renouncing all youthful vanities, and flocking to
				   Christ? You especially have now an extraordinary opportunity; but if
				   you neglect it, it will soon be with you as with those persons who
				   spent all the precious days of youth in sin, and are now come to such a
				   dreadful pass in blindness and hardness. - And you, children, who are
				   unconverted, do not you know that you are going down to hell, to bear
				   the dreadful wrath of that God, who is now angry with you every day and
				   every night? Will you be content to be the children of the devil, when
				   so many other children in the land are converted, and are become the
				   holy and happy children of the King of kings?
				</p><p>
				   And let every one that is yet out of Christ, and hanging over the pit
				   of hell, whether they be old men and women, or middle aged, or young
				   people, or little children, now hearken to the loud calls of God's word
				   and providence. This acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great
				   favour to some, will doubtless be a day of as remarkable vengeance to
				   others. Men's hearts harden, and their guilt increases apace at such a
				   day as this, if they neglect their souls; and never was there so great
				   danger of such persons being given up to hardness of heart and
				   blindness of mind. God seems now to be hastily gathering in his elect
				   in all parts of the land; and probably the greater part of adult
				   persons that ever shall be saved, will be brought in now in a little
				   time, and that it will be as it was on the great out-pouring of the
				   Spirit upon the Jews in the apostles' days; the election will obtain,
				   and the rest will be blinded. If this should be the case with you, you
				   will eternally curse this day, and will curse the day that ever you was
				   born, to see such a season of the pouring out of God's Spirit, and will
				   wish that you had died and gone to hell before you had seen it. Now
				   undoubtedly it is, as it was in the days of John the Baptist, the axe
				   is in an extraordinary manner laid at the root of the trees, that every
				   tree which brings not forth good fruit, may be hewn down and cast into
				   the fire.
				</p><p>
				   Therefore, let every one that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from
				   the wrath to come. The wrath of Almighty God is now undoubtedly hanging
				   over a great part of this congregation. Let every one fly out of Sodom:
				   "Haste and escape for your lives, look not behind you, escape to the
				   mountain, lest you be consumed."

				<title>A Divine and Supernatural Light</title>

                        Immediately Imparted to the Soul<lb />
                             by the Spirit of God,<lb />
               Shown to be Both Scriptural and Rational Doctrine
				</p><p>
				Preached at Northampton, and published at the desire of some of the hearers, in the year 1734.
				</p><p>
				    And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but
   					my Father which is in heaven. <reference osisRef="Matt.16.17">Matthew 16:17</reference>
				</p><p>
				   CHRIST says these words to Peter upon occasion of his professing his
				   faith in him as the Son of God. Our Lord was inquiring of his
				   disciples, who men said he was; not that he needed to be informed, but
				   only to introduce and give occasion to what follows. They answer, that
				   some said he was John the Baptist, and some Elias, and others Jeremias,
				   or one of the Prophets. When they had thus given an account who others
				   said he was, Christ asks them, who they said he was? Simon Peter, whom
				   we find always zealous and forward, was the first to answer: he readily
				   replied to the question, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.
				</p><p>
				   Upon this occasion, Christ says as he does to him, and of him in the
				   text: in which we may observe,
				</p><p>
				   1. That Peter is pronounced blessed on this account. Blessed art thou
				   - "Thou art a happy man, that thou art not ignorant of this, that I am
				   Christ, the Son of the living God. Thou art distinguishingly happy.
				   Others are blinded, and have dark and deluded apprehensions, as you
				   have now given an account, some thinking that I am Elias, and some that
				   I am Jeremias, and some one thing, and some another; but none of them
				   thinking right, all of them misled. Happy art thou, that art so
				   distinguished as to know the truth in this matter."
				</p><p>
				   2. The evidence of
				   this his happiness declared; viz., that God, and he only, had revealed
				   it to him. This is an evidence of his being blessed.
				</p><p>
				   First, As it shows how peculiarly favored he was of God above others;
				   q.d., "How highly favored art thou, that others that are wise and great
				   men, the Scribes, Pharisees, and Rulers, and the nation in general, are
				   left in darkness, to follow their own misguided apprehensions; and that
				   thou shouldst be singled out, as it were, by name, that my Heavenly
				   Father should thus set his love, on thee, Simon Bar-jona. This argues
				   thee blessed, that thou shouldst thus be the object of God's
				   distinguishing love."
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, It evidences his blessedness also, as it intimates that this
				   knowledge is above any that flesh and blood can reveal. "This is such
				   knowledge as only my Father which is in heaven can give: it is too high
				   and excellent to be communicated by such means as other knowledge is.
				   Thou art blessed, that thou knowest that which God alone can teach
				   thee."
				</p><p>
				   The original of this knowledge is here declared, both negatively and
				   positively. Positively, as God is here declared the author of it.
				   Negatively, as it is declared, that flesh and blood had not revealed
				   it. God is the author of all knowledge and understanding whatsoever. He
				   is the author of the knowledge that is obtained by human learning: he
				   is the author of all moral prudence, and of the knowledge and skill
				   that men have in their secular business. Thus it is said of all in
				   Israel that were wise-hearted, and skilled in embroidering, that God
				   had filled them with the spirit of wisdom, <reference osisRef="Exod.28.3">Exodus 28:3</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   God is the author of such knowledge; but yet not so but that flesh and
				   blood reveals it. Mortal men are capable of imparting the knowledge of
				   human arts and sciences, and skill in temporal affairs. God is the
				   author of such knowledge by those means: flesh and blood is employed as
				   the mediate or second cause of it; he conveys it by the power and
				   influence of natural means. But this spiritual knowledge, spoken of in
				   the text, is what God is the author of, and none else: he reveals it,
				   and flesh and blood reveals it not. He imparts this knowledge
				   immediately, not making use of any intermediate natural causes, as he
				   does in other knowledge.
				</p><p>
				   What had passed in the preceding discourse naturally occasioned Christ
				   to observe this; because the disciples had been telling how others did
				   not know him, but were generally mistaken about him, and divided and
				   confounded in their opinions of him: but Peter had declared his assured
				   faith, that he was the Son of God. Now it was natural to observe, how
				   it was not flesh and blood that had revealed it to him, but God: for if
				   this knowledge were dependent on natural causes or means, how came it
				   to pass that they, a company of poor fishermen, illiterate men, and
				   persons of low education, attained to the knowledge of the truth; while
				   the Scribes and Pharisees, men of vastly higher advantages, and greater
				   knowledge and sagacity in other matters, remained in ignorance? This
				   could be owing only to the gracious distinguishing influence and
				   revelation of the Spirit of God. Hence, what I would make the subject
				   of my present discourse from these words, is this
				</p><p>
					<hi type="bold">DOCTRINE</hi>
				</p><p>
				   That there is such a thing as a spiritual and divine light immediately
				   imparted to the soul by God, of a different nature from any that is
				   obtained by natural means.-And on this subject I would,
				</p><p>
				   I. Show what this divine light is.
				</p><p>
				   II. How it is given immediately by God, and not obtained by natural
				   means.
				</p><p>
				   III. Show the truth of the doctrine.
				</p><p>
				   And then conclude with a brief improvement.
				</p><p>
				   I. I would show what this spiritual and divine light is. And in order
				   to it, would show,
				</p><p>
				   First, In a few things what it is not. And here,
				</p><p>
				   1. Those convictions that natural men may have of their sin and misery,
				   is not this spiritual and divine light. Men in a natural condition may
				   have convictions of the guilt that lies upon them, and of the anger of
				   God, and their danger of divine vengeance. Such convictions are from
				   light or sensibleness of truth. That some sinners have a greater
				   conviction of their guilt and misery than others, is because some have
				   more light, or more of an apprehension of truth than others. And this
				   light and conviction may be from the Spirit of God; the Spirit
				   convinces men of sin: but yet nature is much more concerned in it than
				   in the communication of that spiritual and divine light that is spoken
				   of in the doctrine; it is from the Spirit of God only as assisting
				   natural principles, and not as infusing any new principles. Common
				   grace differs from special, in that it influences only by assisting of
				   nature; and not by imparting grace, or bestowing any thing above
				   nature. The light that is obtained is wholly natural, or of no superior
				   kind to what mere nature attains to, though more of that kind be
				   obtained than would be obtained if men were left wholly to themselves:
				   or, in other words, common grace only assists the faculties of the soul
				   to do that more fully which they do by nature, as natural conscience or
				   reason will, by mere nature, make a man sensible of guilt, and will
				   accuse and condemn him when he has done amiss. Conscience is a
				   principle natural to men; and the work that it doth naturally, or of
				   itself, is to give an apprehension of right and wrong, and to suggest
				   to the mind the relation that there is between right and wrong, and a
				   retribution. The Spirit of God, in those convictions which unregenerate
				   men sometimes have, assists conscience to do this work in a further
				   degree than it would do if they were left to themselves: he helps it
				   against those things that tend to stupify it, and obstruct its
				   exercise. But in the renewing and sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost,
				   those things are wrought in the soul that are above nature, and of
				   which there is nothing of the like kind in the soul by nature; and they
				   are caused to exist in the soul habitually, and according to such a
				   stated constitution or law that lays such a foundation for exercises in
				   a continued course, as is called a principle of nature. Not only are
				   remaining principles assisted to do their work more freely and fully,
				   but those principles are restored that were utterly destroyed by the
				   fall; and the mind thence forward habitually exerts those acts that the
				   dominion of sin had made it as wholly destitute of, as a dead body is
				   of vital acts.
				</p><p>
				   The Spirit of God acts in a very different manner in the one case, from
				   what he doth in the other. He may indeed act upon the mind of a natural
				   man, but he acts in the mind of a saint as an indwelling vital
				   principle. He acts upon the mind of an unregenerate person as an
				   extrinsic, occasional agent; for in acting upon them, he doth not unite
				   himself to them; for notwithstanding all his influences that they may
				   be the subjects of, they are still sensual, having not the Spirit, Jude
				   19. But he unites himself with the mind of a saint, takes him for his
				   temple, actuates and influences him as a new supernatural principle of
				   life and action. There is this difference, that the Spirit of God, in
				   acting in the soul of a godly man, exerts and communicates himself
				   there in his own proper nature. Holiness is the proper nature of the
				   Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit operates in the minds of the godly, by
				   uniting himself to them, and living in them, and exerting his own
				   nature in the exercise of their faculties. The Spirit of God may act
				   upon a creature, and yet not in acting communicate himself. The Spirit
				   of God may act upon inanimate creatures; as, the Spirit moved upon the
				   face of the waters, in the beginning of the creation; so the Spirit of
				   God may act upon the minds of men many ways, and communicate himself no
				   more than when he acts upon an inanimate creature. For instance, he may
				   excite thoughts in them, may assist their natural reason and
				   understanding, or may assist other natural principles, and this without
				   any union with the soul, but may act, as it were, as upon an external
				   object. But as he acts in his holy influences and spiritual operations,
				   he acts in a way of peculiar communication of himself; so that the
				   subject is thence denominated spiritual.

				   2. This spiritual and divine light does not consist in any impression
				   made upon the imagination. It is no impression upon the mind, as though
				   one saw any thing with the bodily eyes: it is no imagination or idea of
				   an outward light or glory, or any beauty of form or countenance, or a
				   visible lustre or brightness of any object. The imagination may be
				   strongly impressed with such things; but this is not spiritual light.
				   Indeed when the mind has a lively discovery of spiritual things, and is
				   greatly affected by the power of divine light, it may, and probably
				   very commonly doth, much affect the imagination; so that impressions of
				   an outward beauty or brightness may accompany those spiritual
				   discoveries. But spiritual light is not that impression upon the
				   imagination, but an exceeding different thing from it. Natural men may
				   have lively impressions on their imaginations; and we cannot determine
				   but the devil, who transforms himself into an angel of light, may cause
				   imaginations of an outward beauty, or visible glory, and of sounds and
				   speeches, and other such things; but these are things of a vastly
				   inferior nature to spiritual light.
				</p><p>
				   3. This spiritual light is not the suggesting of any new truths or
				   propositions not contained in the word of God. This suggesting of new
				   truths or doctrines to the mind, independent of any antecedent
				   revelation of those propositions, either in word or writing, is
				   inspiration; such as the prophets and apostles had, and such as some
				   enthusiasts pretend to. But this spiritual light that I am speaking of,
				   is quite a different thing from inspiration: it reveals no new
				   doctrine, it suggests no new proposition to the mind, it teaches no new
				   thing of God, or Christ, or another world, not taught in the Bible, but
				   only gives a due apprehension of those things that are taught in the
				   word of God.
				</p><p>
				   4. It is not every affecting view that men have of the things of
				   religion that is this spiritual and divine light. Men by mere
				   principles of nature are capable of being affected with things that
				   have a special relation to religion as well as other things. A person
				   by mere nature, for instance, may be liable to be affected with the
				   story of Jesus Christ, and the sufferings he underwent, as well as by
				   any other tragical story: he may be the more affected with it from the
				   interest he conceives mankind to have in it: yea, he may be affected
				   with it without believing it; as well as a man may be affected with
				   what he reads in a romance, or sees acted in a stage play. He may be
				   affected with a lively and eloquent description of many pleasant things
				   that attend the state of the blessed in heaven, as well as his
				   imagination be entertained by a romantic description of the
				   pleasantness of fairy land, or the like. And that common belief of the
				   truth of the things of religion, that persons may have from education
				   or otherwise, may help forward their affection. We read in Scripture of
				   many that were greatly affected with things of a religious nature, who
				   yet are there represented as wholly graceless, and many of them very
				   ill men. A person therefore may have affecting views of the things of
				   religion, and yet be very destitute of spiritual light. Flesh and blood
				   may be the author of this: one man may give another an affecting view
				   of divine things with but common assistance: but God alone can give a
				   spiritual discovery of them. - But I proceed to show,
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, Positively what this spiritual and divine light is.
				</p><p>
				   And it may be thus described: a true sense of the divine excellency of
				   the things revealed in the word of God, and a conviction of the truth
				   and reality of them thence arising. This spiritual light primarily
				   consists in the former of these, viz., a real sense and apprehension of
				   the divine excellency of things revealed in the word of God. A
				   spiritual and saving conviction of the truth and reality of these
				   things, arises from such a sight of their divine excellency and glory;
				   so that this conviction of their truth is an effect and natural
				   consequence of this sight of their divine glory. There is therefore in
				   this spiritual light,
				</p><p>
				   1. A true sense of the divine and superlative excellency of the things
				   of religion; a real sense of the excellency of God and Jesus Christ,
				   and of the work of redemption, and the ways and works of God revealed
				   in the gospel. There is a divine and superlative glory in these things;
				   an excellency that is of a vastly higher kind, and more sublime nature
				   than in other things; a glory greatly distinguishing them from all that
				   is earthly and temporal. He that is spiritually enlightened truly
				   apprehends and sees it, or has a sense of it. He does not merely
				   rationally believe that God is glorious, but he has a sense of the
				   gloriousness of God in his heart. There is not only a rational belief
				   that God is holy, and that holiness is a good thing, but there is a
				   sense of the loveliness of God's holiness. There is not only a
				   speculatively judging that God is gracious, but a sense how amiable God
				   is upon that account, or a sense of the beauty of this divine
				   attribute.
				</p><p>
				   There is a twofold understanding or knowledge of good that God has made
				   the mind of man capable of. The first, that which is merely speculative
				   and notional; as when a person only speculatively judges that any thing
				   is, which, by the agreement of mankind, is called good or excellent,
				   viz., that which is most to general advantage, and between which and a
				   reward there is a suitableness, and the like. And the other is, that
				   which consists in the sense of the heart: as when there is a sense of
				   the beauty, amiableness, or sweetness of a thing; so that the heart is
				   sensible of pleasure and delight in the presence of the idea of it. In
				   the former is exercised merely the speculative faculty, or the
				   understanding, strictly so called, or as spoken of in distinction from
				   the will or disposition of the soul. In the latter, the will, or
				   inclination, or heart, are mainly concerned.
				</p><p>
				   Thus there is a difference between having an opinion, that God is holy
				   and gracious, and having a sense of the loveliness and beauty of that
				   holiness and grace. There is a difference between having a rational
				   judgment that honey is sweet, and having a sense of its sweetness. A
				   man may have the former, that knows not how honey tastes; but a man
				   cannot have the latter unless he has an idea of the taste of honey in
				   his mind. So there is a difference between believing that a person is
				   beautiful, and having a sense of his beauty. The former may be obtained
				   by hearsay, but the latter only by seeing the countenance. There is a
				   wide difference between mere speculative rational judging any thing to
				   be excellent, and having a sense of its sweetness and beauty. The
				   former rests only in the head, speculation only is concerned in it; but
				   the heart is concerned in the latter. When the heart is sensible of the
				   beauty and amiableness of a thing, it necessarily feels pleasure in the
				   apprehension. It is implied in a person's being heartily sensible of
				   the loveliness of a thing, that the idea of it is sweet and pleasant to
				   his soul; which is a far different thing from having a rational opinion
				   that it is excellent.
				</p><p>
				   2. There arises from this sense of divine excellency of things
				   contained in the word of God, a conviction of the truth and reality of
				   them; and that either directly or indirectly.
				</p><p>
				   First, Indirectly, and that two ways.
				</p><p>
				   1. As the prejudices that are in the heart, against the truth of divine
				   things, are hereby removed; so that the mind becomes susceptive of the
				   due force of rational arguments for their truth. The mind of man is
				   naturally full of prejudices against the truth of divine things: it is
				   full of enmity against the doctrines of the gospel; which is a
				   disadvantage to those arguments that prove their truth, and causes them
				   to lose their force upon the mind. But when a person has discovered to
				   him the divine excellency of Christian doctrines, this destroys the
				   enmity, removes those prejudices, and sanctifies the reason, and causes
				   it to lie open to the force of arguments for their truth.
				</p><p>
				   Hence was the different effect that Christ's miracles had to convince
				   the disciples from what they had to convince the Scribes and Pharisees.
				   Not that they had a stronger reason, or had their reason more improved;
				   but their reason was sanctified, and those blinding prejudices, that
				   the Scribes and Pharisees were under, were removed by the sense they
				   had of the excellency of Christ and his doctrine.
				</p><p>
				   2. It not only removes the hinderances of reason, but positively helps
				   reason. It makes even the speculative notions the more lively. It
				   engages the attention of the mind, with the fixedness and intenseness
				   to that kind of objects; which causes it to have a clearer view of
				   them, and enables it more clearly to see their mutual relations, and
				   occasions it to take more notice of them. The ideas themselves that
				   otherwise are dim and obscure, are by this means impressed with the
				   greater strength, and have a light cast upon them; so that the mind can
				   better judge of them. As he that beholds the objects on the face of the
				   earth, when the light of the sun is cast upon them; so that the mind
				   can better judge of them. As he that beholds the objects on the face of
				   the earth, when the light of the sun is cast upon them, is under
				   greater advantage to discern them in their true forms and mutual
				   relations, than he that sees them in a dim starlight or twilight.
				</p><p>
				   The mind having a sensibleness of the excellency of divine objects,
				   dwells upon them with delight; and the powers of the soul are more
				   awakened and enlivened to employ themselves in the contemplation of
				   them, and exert themselves more fully and much more to the purpose. The
				   beauty and sweetness of the objects draws on the faculties, and draws
				   forth their exercises: so that reason itself is under far greater
				   advantages for its proper and free exercises, and to attain its proper
				   end, free of darkness and delusion. - But,
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, A true sense of the divine excellency of the things of God's
				   word doth more directly and immediately convince of the truth of them;
				   and that because the excellency of these things is so superlative.
				   There is a beauty in them that is so divine and godlike, that is
				   greatly and evidently distinguishing of them from things merely human,
				   or that men are the inventors and authors of; a glory that is so high
				   and great, that when clearly seen, commands assent to their divinity
				   and reality. When there is an actual and lively discovery of this
				   beauty and excellency, it will not allow of any such thought as that it
				   is a human work, or the fruit of men's invention. This evidence that
				   they that are spiritually enlightened have of the truth of the things
				   of religion, is a kind of intuitive and immediate evidence. They
				   believe the doctrines of God's word to be divine, because they see
				   divinity in them; i.e., they see a divine, and transcendent, and most
				   evidently distinguishing glory in them; such a glory as, if clearly
				   seen, does not leave room to doubt of their being of God, and not of
				   men.
				</p><p>
				   Such a conviction of the truth of religion as this, arising, these
				   ways, from a sense of the divine excellency of them, is that true
				   spiritual conviction that there is in saving faith. And this original
				   of it, is that by which it is most essentially distinguished from that
				   common assent, which unregenerate men are capable of.
				</p><p>
				   II. I proceed now to the second thing proposed, viz., to show how this
				   light is immediately given by God, and not obtained by natural means.
				   And here,
				</p><p>
				   1. It is not intended that the natural faculties are not made use of in
				   it. The natural faculties are the subject of this light: and they are
				   the subject in such a manner, that they are not merely passive, but
				   active in it; the acts and exercises of man's understanding are
				   concemed and made use of in it. God, in letting in this light into the
				   soul, deals with man according to his nature, or as a rational
				   creature; and makes use of his human faculties. But yet this light is
				   not the less immediately from God for that; though the faculties are
				   made use of, it is as the subject and not as the cause; and that acting
				   of the faculties in it, is not the cause, but is either implied in the
				   thing itself (in the light that is imparted) or is the consequence of
				   it. As the use that we make of our eyes in beholding various objects,
				   when the sun arises, is not the cause of the light that discovers those
				   objects to us.
				</p><p>
				   2. It is not intended that outward means have no concern in this
				   affair. As I have observed already, it is not in this affair, as it is
				   in inspiration, where new truths are suggested: for here is by this
				   light only given a due apprehension of the same truths that are
				   revealed in the word of God; and therefore it is not given without the
				   word. The gospel is made use of in this affair: this light is the
				   "light of the glorious gospel of Christ", <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:4</reference>. The gospel is as
				   a glass by which this light is conveyed to us, <reference osisRef="1Cor.13.12">1 Corinthians 13:12</reference>. "Now we
				   see through a glass." - But,
				</p><p>
				   3. When it is said that this light is given immediately by God, and not
				   obtained by natural means, hereby is intended, that it is given by God
				   without making use of any means that operate by their own power, or a
				   natural force God makes use of means; but it is not as mediate causes
				   to produce this effect. There are not truly any second causes of it;
				   but it is produced by God immediately. The word of God is no proper
				   cause of this effect: it does not operate by any natural force in it.
				   The word of God is only made use of to convey to the mind the subject
				   matter of this saving instruction: and this indeed it doth convey to us
				   by natural force or influence. It conveys to our minds these and those
				   doctrines; it is the cause of the notion of them in our heads, but not
				   of the sense of the divine excellency of them in our hearts. Indeed a
				   person cannot have spiritual light without the word. But that does not
				   argue, that the word properly causes that light. The mind cannot see
				   the excellency of any doctrine, unless that doctrine be first in the
				   mind; but the seeing of the excellency of the doctrine may be
				   immediately from the Spirit of God; though the conveying of the
				   doctrine or proposition itself may be by the word. So that the notions
				   that are the subject matter of this light, are conveyed to the mind by
				   the word of God; but that due sense of the heart, wherein this light
				   formally consists, is immediately by the Spirit of God. As for
				   instance, that notion that there is a Christ, and that Christ is holy
				   and gracious, is conveyed to the mind by the word of God: but the sense
				   of the excellency of Christ by reason of that holiness and grace, is
				   nevertheless immediately the work of the Holy Spirit. - I come now,
				</p><p>
				   III. To show the truth of the doctrine; that is, to show that there is
				   such a thing as that spiritual light that has been described, thus
				   immediately let into the mind by God. And here I would show briefly,
				   that this doctrine is both scriptural and rational.
				</p><p>
				   First, It is scriptural. My text is not only full to the purpose, but
				   it is a doctrine that the Scripture abounds in. We are there abundantly
				   taught, that the saints differ from the ungodly in this, that they have
				   the knowledge of God, and a sight of God, and of Jesus Christ. I shall
				   mention but few texts of many. <reference osisRef="1John.3.6">1 John 3:6</reference>, "Whosoever sinneth, has not
				   seen him, nor known him." 3 John 11, "He that doth good, is of God: but
				   he that doth evil, hath not seen God." <reference osisRef="John.14.19">John 14:19</reference>, "The world seeth me
				   no more; but ye see me." <reference osisRef="John.17.3">John 17:3</reference>, "And this is eternal life, that
				   they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
				   hast sent." This knowledge, or sight of God and Christ, cannot be a
				   mere speculative knowledge; because it is spoken of as a seeing and
				   knowing, wherein they differ from the ungodly. And by these Scriptures
				   it must not only be a different knowledge in degree and circumstances,
				   and different in its effects; but it must be entirely different in
				   nature and kind.
				</p><p>
				   And this light and knowledge is always spoken of as immediately given
				   of God, <reference osisRef="Matt.11.25 Matt.11.26 Matt.11.27">Matthew 11:25-27</reference>: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank
				   thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
				   things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
				   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are
				   delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son but the
				   Father: neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to
				   whomsoever the Son will reveal him." Here this effect is ascribed alone
				   to the arbitrary operation, and gift of God, bestowing this knowledge
				   on whom he will, and distinguishing those with it, that have the least
				   natural advantage or means for knowledge, even babes, when it is denied
				   to the wise and prudent. And the imparting of the knowledge of God is
				   here appropriated to the Son of God, as his sole prerogative. And
				   again, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>, "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of
				   darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
				   of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ." This plainly shows,
				   that there is such a thing as a discovery of the divine superlative
				   glory and excellency of God and Christ, and that peculiar to the
				   saints: and also, that it is as immediately from God, as light from the
				   sun: and that it is the immediate effect of his power and will; for it
				   is compared to God's creating the light by his powerful word in the
				   beginning of the creation; and is said to be by the Spirit of the Lord,
				   in the 18th verse of the preceding chapter. God is spoken of as giving
				   the knowledge of Christ in conversion, as of what before was hidden and
				   unseen in that. <reference osisRef="Gal.1.15 Gal.1.16">Galatians 1:15-16</reference>, "But when it pleased God, who separated
				   me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son
				   in me." The Scripture also speaks plainly of such a knowledge of the
				   word of God, as has been described, as the immediate gift of God, <reference osisRef="Ps.119.18">Psalms 119:18</reference>: "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
				   thy law." What could the Psalmist mean when he begged of God to open
				   his eyes? Was he ever blind? Might he not have resort to the law and
				   see every word and sentence in it when he pleased? and what could he
				   mean by those wondrous things? Was it the wonderful stories of the
				   creation, and deluge, and Israel's passing through the Red Sea, and the
				   like? Were not his eyes open to read these strange things when he
				   would? Doubtless by wondrous things in God's law, he had respect to
				   those distinguishing and wonderful excellencies, and marvellous
				   manifestations of the divine perfections, and glory, that there was in
				   the commands and doctrines of the word, and those works and counsels of
				   God that were there revealed. So the Scripture speaks of a knowledge of
				   God's dispensation, and covenant of mercy, and way of grace towards his
				   people, as peculiar to the saints, and given only by God, <reference osisRef="Ps.25.14">Psalms 25:14</reference>:
				   "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show
				   them his covenant."
				</p><p>
				   And that a true and saving belief of the truth of religion is that
				   which arises from such a discovery, is also what the Scripture teaches.
				   As <reference osisRef="John.6.40">John 6:40</reference>, "And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one
				   which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life;"
				   where it is plain that a true faith is what arises from a spiritual
				   sight of Christ. and <reference osisRef="John.17.6 John.17.7 John.17.8">John 17:6-8</reference>, "I have manifested thy name unto
				   the men which thou gavest me out of the world. Now they have known that
				   all things whatsoever thou hast given me, are of thee. For I have given
				   unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them,
				   and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed
				   that thou didst send me;" where Christ's manifesting God's name to the
				   disciples, or giving them the knowledge of God, was that whereby they
				   knew that Christ's doctrine was of God, and that Christ himself was of
				   him, proceeded from him, and was sent by him. Again, <reference osisRef="John.12.44 John.12.45 John.12.46">John 12:44-46</reference>,
				   "Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,
				   but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
				   I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me,
				   should not abide in darkness." Their believing in Christ, and
				   spiritually seeing him, are spoken of as running parallel.
				</p><p>
				   Christ condemns the Jews that they did not know that he was the
				   Messiah, and that his doctrine was true, from an inward distinguishing
				   taste and relish of what was divine, in <reference osisRef="Luke.12.56 Luke.12.57">Luke 12:56-57</reference>. He having there
				   blamed the Jews, that though they could discern the face of the sky and
				   of the earth, and signs of the weather, that yet they could not discern
				   those times; or as it is expressed in Matthew, the signs of those
				   times; he adds, yea, and why even of your own selves, judge ye not what
				   is right? i.e., without extrinsic signs. Why have ye not that sense of
				   true excellency, whereby ye may distinguish that which is holy and
				   divine? Why have ye not that savor of the things of God, by which you
				   may see the distinguishing glory, and evident divinity of me and my
				   doctrine?
				</p><p>
				   The Apostle Peter mentions it as what gave them (the apostles) good and
				   well grounded assurance of the truth of the gospel, that they had seen
				   the divine glory of Christ. <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.16">2 Peter 1:16</reference>, "For we have not followed
				   cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and
				   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
				   The apostle has respect to that visible glory of Christ which they saw
				   in his transfiguration: that glory was so divine, having such an
				   ineffable appearance and semblance of divine holiness, majesty and
				   grace, that it evidently denoted him to be a divine person. But if a
				   sight of Christ's outward glory might give a rational assurance of his
				   divinity, why may not an apprehension of his spiritual glory do so too?
				   Doubtless Christ's spiritual glory is in itself as distinguishing, and
				   as plainly showing his divinity, as his outward glory, and a great deal
				   more: for his spiritual glory is that wherein his divinity consists;
				   and the outward glory of his transfiguration showed him to be divine,
				   only as it was a remarkable image or representation of that spiritual
				   glory. Doubtless, therefore, he that has had a clear sight of the
				   spiritual glory of Christ, may say, I have not followed cunningly
				   devised fables, but have been an eyewitness of his majesty, upon as
				   good grounds as the apostle, when he had respect to the outward glory
				   of Christ that he had seen. - But this brings me to what was proposed
				   next, viz., to show that,
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, This doctrine is rational.
				</p><p>
				   1. It is rational to suppose, that there is really such an excellency
				   in divine things, that is so transcendent and exceedingly different
				   from what is in other things, that, if it were seen, would most
				   evidently distinguish them. We cannot rationally doubt but that things
				   that are divine, that appertain to the Supreme Being, are vastly
				   different from things that are human; that there is that godlike, high
				   and glorious excellency in them, that does most remarkably difference
				   them from the things that are of men; insomuch that if the difference
				   were but seen, it would have a convincing, satisfying influence upon
				   any one, that they are what they are, viz., divine. What reason can be
				   offered against it? Unless we would argue, that God is not remarkably
				   distinguished in glory from men.
				</p><p>
				   If Christ should now appear to any one as he did on the mount at his
				   transfiguration; or if he should appear to the world in the glory that
				   he now appears in, as he will do at the day of judgment; without doubt,
				   the glory and majesty that he would appear in, would be such as would
				   satisfy every one that he was a divine person, and that religion was
				   true: and it would be a most reasonable, and well grounded conviction
				   too. And why may there not be that stamp of divinity, or divine glory
				   on the word of God, on the scheme and doctrine of the gospel, that may
				   be in like manner distinguishing and as rationally convincing, provided
				   it be but seen? It is rational to suppose, that when God speaks to the
				   world, there should be something in his word or speech vastly different
				   from man's word. Supposing that God never had spoken to the world, but
				   we had noticed that he was about to do it; that he was about to reveal
				   himself from heaven, and speak to us immediately himself, in divine
				   speeches or discourses, as it were from his own mouth, or that he
				   should give us a book of his own inditing; after what manner should we
				   expect that he would speak? Would it not be rational to suppose, that
				   his speech would be exceeding different from man's speech, that he
				   should speak like a God; that is, that there should be such an
				   excellency and sublimity in his speech or word, such a stamp of wisdom,
				   holiness, majesty and other divine perfections, that the word of man,
				   yea of the wisest of men, should appear mean and base in comparison of
				   it? Doubtless it would be thought rational to expect this, and
				   unreasonable to think otherwise. When a wise man speaks in the exercise
				   of his wisdom, there is something in every thing he says, that is very
				   distinguishable from the talk of a little child. So, without doubt, and
				   much more, is the speech of God (if there be any such thing as the
				   speech of God) to be distinguished from that of the wisest of men;
				   agreeably to <reference osisRef="Jer.23.28 Jer.23.29">Jeremiah 23:28-29</reference>. God having there been reproving the false
				   prophets that prophesied in his name, and pretended that what they
				   spake was his word, when indeed it was their own word, says, "The
				   prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my
				   word, let him speak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat?
				   saith the Lord. Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like
				   a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?"
				</p><p>
				   2. If there be such a distinguishing excellency in divine things; it is
				   rational to suppose that there may be such a thing as seeing it. What
				   should hinder but that it may be seen? It is no argument, that there is
				   no such thing as such a distinguishing excellency, or that, if there
				   be, that it cannot be seen, that some do not see it, though they may be
				   discerning men in temporal matters. It is not rational to suppose, if
				   there be any such excellency in divine things, that wicked men should
				   see it. It is not rational to suppose, that those whose minds are full
				   of spiritual pollution, and under the power of filthy lusts, should
				   have any relish or sense of divine beauty or excellency; or that their
				   minds should be susceptive of that light that is in its own nature so
				   pure and heavenly. It need not seem at all strange, that sin should so
				   blind the mind, seeing that men's particular natural tempers and
				   dispositions will so much blind them in secular matters; as when men's
				   natural temper is melancholy, jealous, fearful, proud, or the like.
				</p><p>
				   3. It is rational to suppose, that this knowledge should be given
				   immediately by God, and not be obtained by natural means. Upon what
				   account should it seem unreasonable, that there should be any immediate
				   communication between God and the creature? It is strange that men
				   should make any matter of difficulty of it. Why should not he that made
				   all things, still have something immediately to do with the things that
				   he has made? Where lies the great difficulty, if we own the being of a
				   God, and that he created all things out of nothing, of allowing some
				   immediate influence of God on the creation still? And if it be
				   reasonable to suppose it with respect to any part of the creation, it
				   is especially so with respect to reasonable, intelligent creatures; who
				   are next to God in the gradation of the different orders of beings, and
				   whose business is most immediately with God; who were made on purpose
				   for those exercises that do respect God and wherein they have nextly to
				   do with God: for reason teaches, that man was made to serve and glorify
				   his Creator. And if it be rational to suppose that God immediately
				   communicates himself to man in any affair, it is in this. It is
				   rational to suppose that God would reserve that knowledge and wisdom,
				   that is of such a divine and excellent nature, to be bestowed
				   immediately by himself, and that it should not be left in the power of
				   second causes. Spiritual wisdom and grace is that highest and most
				   excellent gift that ever God bestows on any creature: in this the
				   highest excellency and perfection of a rational creature consists. It
				   is also immensely the most important of all divine gifts: it is that
				   wherein man's happiness consists, and on which his everlasting welfare
				   depends. How rational is it to suppose that God, however he has left
				   meaner goods and lower gifts to second causes, and in some sort in
				   their power, yet should reserve this most excellent, divine, and
				   important of all divine communications, in his own hands, to be
				   bestowed immediately by himself, as a thing too great for second causes
				   to be concerned in!
				</p><p>
				   It is rational to suppose, that this blessing should be immediately
				   from God; for there is no gift or benefit that is in itself so nearly
				   related to the divine nature, there is nothing the creature receives
				   that is so much of God, of his nature, so much a participation of the
				   deity: it is a kind of emanation of God's beauty, and is related to God
				   as the light is to the sun. It is therefore congruous and fit, that
				   when it is given of God, it should be nextly from himself, and by
				   himself, according to his own sovereign will.
				</p><p>
				   It is rational to suppose, that it should be beyond a man's power to
				   obtain this knowledge and light by the mere strength of natural reason;
				   for it is not a thing that belongs to reason, to see the beauty and
				   loveliness of spiritual things; it is not a speculative thing, but
				   depends on the sense of the heart. Reason indeed is necessary in order
				   to it, as it is by reason only that we are become the subjects of the
				   means of it; which means I have already shown to be necessary in order
				   to it, though they have no proper causal in the affair. It is by reason
				   that we become possessed of a notion of those doctrines that are the
				   subject matter of this divine light; and reason may many ways be
				   indirectly and remotely an advantage to it. And reason has also to do
				   in the acts that are immediately consequent on this discovery: a seeing
				   the truth of religion from hence, is by reason; though it be but by one
				   step, and the inference be immediate. So reason has to do in that
				   accepting of, and trusting in Christ, that is consequent on it. But if
				   we take reason strictly - not for the faculty of mental perception in
				   general, but for ratiocination, or a power of inferring by arguments -
				   the perceiving of spiritual beauty and excellency no more belongs to
				   reason, than it belongs to the sense of feeling to perceive colours, or
				   to the power of seeing to perceive the sweetness of food. It is out of
				   reason's province to perceive the beauty or loveliness of any thing:
				   such a perception does not belong to that faculty. Reason's work is to
				   perceive truth and not excellency. It is not ratiocination that gives
				   men the perception of the beauty and amiableness of a countenance,
				   though it may be many ways indirectly an advantage to it; yet it is no
				   more reason that immediately perceives it, than it is reason that
				   perceives the sweetness of honey: it depends on the sense of the heart.
				   - Reason may determine that a countenance is beautiful to others, it
				   may determine that honey is sweet to others; but it will never give me
				   a perception of its sweetness.
				</p><p>
				   I will conclude with a very brief improvement of what has been said.
				</p><p>
				   First, This doctrine may lead us to reflect on the goodness of God,
				   that has so ordered it, that a saving evidence of the truth of the
				   gospel is such, as is attainable by persons of mean capacities and
				   advantages, as well as those that are of the greatest parts and
				   learning. If the evidence of the gospel depended only on history, and
				   such reasonings as learned men only are capable of, it would be above
				   the reach of far the greatest part of mankind. But persons with but an
				   ordinary degree of knowledge, are capable, without a long and subtile
				   train of reasoning, to see the divine excellency of the things of
				   religion: they are capable of being taught by the Spirit of God, as
				   well as learned men. The evidence that is this way obtained, is vastly
				   better and more satisfying, than all that can be obtained by the
				   arguings of those that are most learned, and greatest masters of
				   reason. And babes are as capable of knowing these things, as the wise
				   and prudent; and they are often hid from these things, as the wise and
				   prudent; and they are often hid from these when they are revealed to
				   those. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.26 1Cor.1.27">1 Corinthians 1:26-27</reference>, "For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not
				   many wise men, after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are
				   called. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world -."
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, This doctrine may well put us upon examining ourselves,
				   whether we have ever had this divine light, that has been described,
				   let into our souls. If there be such a thing indeed, and it be not only
				   a notion or whimsy of persons of weak and distempered brains, then
				   doubtless it is a thing of great importance, whether we have thus been
				   taught by the Spirit of God; whether the light of the glorious gospel
				   of Christ, who is the image of God, hath shined unto us, giving us the
				   light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ;
				   whether we have seen the Son, and believed on him, or have that faith
				   of gospel-doctrines which arises from a spiritual sight of Christ.
				</p><p>
				   Thirdly, All may hence be exhorted earnestly to seek this spiritual
				   light. To influence and move to it, the following things may be
				   considered.
				</p><p>
				   1. This is the most excellent and divine wisdom that any creature is
				   capable of. It is more excellent than any human learning; it is far
				   more excellent than all the knowledge of the greatest philosophers or
				   statesmen. Yea, the least glimpse of the glory of God in the face of
				   Christ doth more exalt and ennoble the soul, than all the knowledge of
				   those that have the greatest speculative understanding in divinity
				   without grace. This knowledge has the most noble object that is or can
				   be, viz., the divine glory or excellency of God and Christ. The
				   knowledge of these objects is that wherein consists the most excellent
				   knowledge of the angels, yea, of God himself.
				</p><p>
				   2. This knowledge is that which is above all others sweet and joyful.
				   Men have a great deal of pleasure in human knowledge, in studies of
				   natural things; but this is nothing to that joy which arises from this
				   divine light shining into the soul. This light gives a view of those
				   things that are immensely the most exquisitely beautiful, and capable
				   of delighting the eye of the understanding. This spiritual light is the
				   dawning of the light of glory in the heart. There is nothing so
				   powerful as this to support persons in affliction, and to give the mind
				   peace and brightness in this stormy and dark world.
				</p><p>
				   3. This light is such as effectually influences the inclination, and
				   changes the nature of the soul. It assimilates the nature to the divine
				   nature, and changes the soul into an image of the same glory that is
				   beheld. <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>, "But we all with open face, beholding as in a
				   glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from
				   glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." This knowledge will
				   wean from the world, and raise the inclination to heavenly things. It
				   will turn the heart to God as the fountain of good, and to choose him
				   for the only portion. This light, and this only, will bring the soul to
				   a saving close with Christ. It conforms the heart to the gospel,
				   mortifies its enmity and opposition against the scheme of salvation
				   therein revealed: it causes the heart to embrace the joyful tidings,
				   and entirely to adhere to, and acquiesce in the revelation of Christ as
				   our Saviour: it causes the whole soul to accord and symphonize with it,
				   admitting it with entire credit and respect cleaving to it with full
				   inclination and affection; and it effectually disposes the soul to give
				   up itself entirely to Christ.
				</p><p>
				   4. This light, and this only, has its fruit in a universal holiness of
				   life. No merely notional or speculative understanding of the doctrines
				   of religion will ever bring to this. But this light, as it reaches the
				   bottom of the heart, and changes the nature, so it will effectually
				   dispose to a universal obedience. It shows God's worthiness to be
				   obeyed and served. It draws forth the heart in a sincere love to God,
				   which is the only principle of a true, gracious, and universal
				   obedience; and it convinces of the reality of those glorious rewards
				   that God has promised to them that obey him.

				<title>Christ's Agony</title>
				<p>
					A Sermon<lb />
					  by<lb />
					Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
				  <reference osisRef="Luke.22.44">Luke 22:44</reference> - And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat
				  was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
				</p><p>
				   Our Lord Jesus Christ, in his original nature, was infinitely above all
				   suffering, for he was "God over all, blessed for evermore;" but, when
				   he became man, he was not only capable of suffering, but partook of
				   that nature that is remarkably feeble and exposed to suffering. The
				   human nature, on account of its weakness, is in Scripture compared to
				   the grass of the field, which easily withers and decays. So it is
				   compared to a leaf; and to the dry stubble; and to a blast of wind: and
				   the nature of feeble man is said to be but dust and ashes, to have its
				   foundation in the dust, and to be crushed before the moth. It was this
				   nature, with all its weakness and exposedness to sufferings, which
				   Christ, who is the Lord God omnipotent, took upon him. He did not take
				   the human nature on him in its first, most perfect and vigorous state,
				   but in that feeble forlorn state which it is in since the fall; and
				   therefore Christ is called "a tender plant," and "a root out of a dry
				   ground." <reference osisRef="Isa.53.2">Isaiah 53:2</reference>. "For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant,
				   and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
				   when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him."
				   Thus, as Christ's principal errand into the world was suffering, so,
				   agreeably to that errand, he came with such a nature and in such
				   circumstances, as most made way for his suffering; so his whole life
				   was filled up with suffering, he began to suffer in his infancy, but
				   his suffering increased the more he drew near to the close of his life.
				   His suffering after his public ministry began, was probably much
				   greater than before; and the latter part of the time of his public
				   ministry seems to have been distinguished by suffering. The longer
				   Christ lived in the world, the more men saw and heard of him, the more
				   they hated him. His enemies were more and more enraged by the
				   continuance of the opposition that he made to their lusts; and the
				   devil having been often baffled by him, grew more and more enraged, and
				   strengthened the battle more and more against him: so that the cloud
				   over Christ's head grew darker and darker, as long as he lived in the
				   world, till it was in its greatest blackness when he hung upon the
				   cross and cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me! Before
				   this, it was exceedingly dark, in the time of his agony in the garden;
				   of which we have an account in the words now read; and which I propose
				   to make the subject of my present discourse. The word agony properly
				   signifies an earnest strife, such as is witnessed in wrestling,
				   running, or fighting. And therefore in <reference osisRef="Luke.13.24">Luke 13:24</reference>. "Strive to enter in
				   at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in,
				   and shall not be able;" the word in the original, translated strive, is
				   agwnizesqe. "Agonize, to enter in at the strait gate." The word is
				   especially used for that sort of strife, which in those days was
				   exhibited in the Olympic games, in which men strove for the mastery in
				   running, wrestling, and other such kinds of exercises; and a prize was
				   set up that was bestowed on the conqueror. Those, who thus contended,
				   were, in the language then in use, said to agonize. Thus the apostle in
				   his epistle to the Christians of Corinth, a city of Greece, where such
				   games were annually exhibited, says in allusion to the strivings of the
				   combatants, "And every man that striveth for the mastery," in the
				   original, every one that agonizeth, "is temperate in all things." The
				   place where those games were held was called Agwn, or the place of
				   agony; and the word is particularly used in Scripture for that striving
				   in earnest prayer wherein persons wrestle with God:they are said to
				   agonize, or to be in agony, in prayer. So the word is used <reference osisRef="Rom.15.30">Romans 15:30</reference>.
				   "Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for
				   the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers
				   to God for me:" in the original sunagwnizesqai moi, that ye agonize
				   together with me. So <reference osisRef="Col.4.12">Colossians 4:12</reference>. "Always labouring fervently for you in
				   prayer, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God:"
				   in the original agwnizwn agonizing for you. So that when it is said in
				   the text that Christ was in an agony, the meaning is, that his soul was
				   in a great and earnest strife and conflict. It was so in two respects:
				</p><p>
				   1. As his soul was in a great and sore conflict with those terrible and
				   amazing views and apprehensions which he then had.
				</p><p>
				   2. As he was at the same time in great labour and earnest strife with
				   God in prayer.
				</p><p>
				   I propose therefore, in discoursing on the subject of Christ's agony,
				   distinctly to unfold it, under these two propositions,
				</p><p>
				   I. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a sore
				   conflict with those terrible and amazing views and apprehensions, of
				   which he was then the subject.
				</p><p>
				   II. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a great and
				   earnest labour and struggle with God in prayer.
				</p><p>
				   I. The soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a sore conflict
				   with those terrible amazing views and apprehensions, of which he was
				   then the subject.
				</p><p>
				   In illustrating this proposition I shall endeavour to show,
				</p><p>
				   1. What those views and apprehensions were.
				</p><p>
				   2. That the conflict or agony of Christ's soul was occasioned by those
				   views and apprehensions.
				</p><p>
				   3. That this conflict was peculiarly great and distressing; and,
				</p><p>
				   4. What we may suppose to be the special design of God in giving Christ
				   those terrible views and apprehensions, and causing him to suffer that
				   dreadful conflict, before he was crucified.
				</p><p>
				   I proposed to show,
				</p><p>
				   First, What were those terrible views and amazing apprehensions which
				   Christ had in his agony. This may be explained by considering,
				</p><p>
				   1. The cause of those views and apprehensions; and,
				</p><p>
				   2. The manner in which they were then experienced.
				</p><p>
				   1. The cause of those views and apprehensions, which Christ had in his
				   agony in the garden, was the bitter cup which he was soon after to
				   drink on the cross. The sufferings which Christ underwent in his agony
				   in the garden, were not his greatest sufferings; though they were so
				   very great. But his last sufferings upon the cross were his principal
				   sufferings; and therefore they are called "the cup that he had to
				   drink." The sufferings of the cross, under which he was slain, are
				   always in the Scriptures represented as the main sufferings of Christ;
				   those in which especially "he bare our sins in his own body," and made
				   atonement for sin. His enduring the cross, his humbling himself, and
				   becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, is spoken of
				   as the main thing wherein his sufferings appeared. This is the cup that
				   Christ had set before him in his agony. It is manifest that Christ had
				   this in view at this time, from the prayers which he then offered.
				   According to Matthew, Christ made three prayers that evening while in
				   the garden of Gethsemane, and all on this one subject, the bitter cup
				   that he was to drink. Of the first, we have an account in <reference osisRef="Matt.26.39">Matthew 26:39</reference>.
				   "And he went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying,
				   O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;
				   nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt:" of the second in the 42d
				   verse, "He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, O my
				   Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, thy will
				   be done:" and of the third in the 44th verse, "And he left them, and
				   went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
				   From this it plainly appears what it was of which Christ had such
				   terrible views and apprehensions at that time. What he thus insists on
				   in his prayers, shows on what his mind was so deeply intent. It was his
				   sufferings on the cross, which were to be endured the next day, when
				   there should be darkness over all the earth, and at the same time a
				   deeper darkness over the soul of Christ, of which he had now such
				   lively views and distressing apprehensions.
				</p><p>
				   2. The manner in which this bitter cup was now set in Christ's view.
				</p><p>
				   (1.) He had a lively apprehension of it impressed at that time on his
				   mind. He had an apprehension of the cup that he was to drink before.
				   His principal errand into the the world was to drink that cup, and he
				   therefore was never unthoughtful of it, but always bore it in his mind,
				   and often spoke of it to his disciples. Thus <reference osisRef="Matt.16.21">Matthew 16:21</reference>. "From that
				   time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go
				   unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and chief
				   priests, and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day
				   ." Again ch. 20:17, 18, 19. "And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the
				   twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, Behold, we go up
				   to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief
				   priests, and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death. And
				   shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to
				   crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again." The same thing was
				   the subject of conversation on the mount with Moses and Elias when he
				   was transfigured. So he speaks of his bloody baptism, <reference osisRef="Luke.12.50">Luke 12:50</reference>. "But
				   I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it
				   be accomplished!" He speaks of it again to Zebedee's children, <reference osisRef="Matt.20.22">Matthew 20:22</reference>. "Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to
				   be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto
				   him, We are able." He spake of his being lifted up. <reference osisRef="John.8.28">John 8:28</reference>. 'Then
				   said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall
				   ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father
				   hath taught me, I speak these things ." <reference osisRef="John.12.34">John 12:34</reference>. "The people
				   answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for
				   ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is
				   this Son of man?" So he spake of destroying the temple of his body,
				   <reference osisRef="John.2.19">John 2:19</reference>. "Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
				   in three days I will raise it up ." And he was very much in speaking of
				   it a little before his agony, in his dying counsels to his disciples in
				   the 12th and 13th ch. of John. Thus this was not the first time that
				   Christ had this bitter cup in his view. On the contrary, he seems
				   always to have had it in view. But it seems that at this time God gave
				   him an extraordinary view of it. A sense of that wrath that was to be
				   poured out upon him, and of those amazing sufferings that he was to
				   undergo, was strongly impressed on his mind by the immediate power of
				   God; so that he had far more full and lively apprehensions of the
				   bitterness of the cup which he was to drink than he ever had before,
				   and these apprehensions were so terrible, that his feeble human nature
				   shrunk at the sight, and was ready to sink.
				</p><p>
				   2. The cup of bitterness was now represented as just at hand. He had
				   not only a more clear and lively view of it than before; but it was now
				   set directly before him, that he might without delay take it up and
				   drink it; for then, within that same hour, Judas was to come with his
				   band of men, and he was then to deliver up himself into their hands to
				   the end that he might drink this cup the next day; unless indeed he
				   refused to take it, and so made his escape from that place where Judas
				   would come; which he had opportunity enough to do if he had been so
				   minded. Having thus shown what those terrible views and apprehensions
				   were which Christ had in the time of his agony; I shall endeavour to
				   show,
				</p><p>
				   II. That the conflict which the soul of Christ then endured was
				   occasioned by those views and apprehensions. The sorrow and distress
				   which his soul then suffered, arose from that lively, and full, and
				   immediate view which he had then given him of that cup of wrath; by
				   which God the Father did as it were set the cup down before him, for
				   him to take it and drink it. Some have inquired, what was the occasion
				   of that distress and agony, and many speculations there have been about
				   it, but the account which the Scripture itself gives us is sufficiently
				   full in this matter, and does not leave room for speculation or doubt.
				   The thing that Christ's mind was so full of at that time was, without
				   doubt, the same with that which his mouth was so full of: it was the
				   dread which his feeble human nature had of that dreadful cup, which was
				   vastly more terrible than Nebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace. He had then a
				   near view of that furnace of wrath, into which he was to be cast; he
				   was brought to the mouth of the furnace that he might look into it, and
				   stand and view its raging flames, and see the glowings of its heat,
				   that he might know where he was going and what he was about to suffer.
				   This was the thing that filled his soul with sorrow and darkness, this
				   terrible sight as it were overwhelmed him. For what was that human
				   nature of Christ to such mighty wrath as this? it was in itself,
				   without the supports of God, but a feeble worm of the dust, a thing
				   that was crushed before the moth, none of God's children ever had such
				   a cup set before them, as this first being of every creature had. But
				   not to dwell any longer on this, I hasten to show,
				</p><p>
				   III. That the conflict in Christ's soul, in this view of his last
				   sufferings, was dreadful, beyond all expression or conception. This
				   will appear,
				</p><p>
				   1. From what is said of its dreadfulness in the history. By one
				   evangelist we are told, (<reference osisRef="Matt.26.37">Matthew 26:37</reference>.) "He began to be sorrowful and
				   very heavy; and by another, (<reference osisRef="Mark.14.33">Mark 14:33</reference>.) "And he taketh with him
				   Peter, and James, and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very
				   heavy." These expressions hold forth the intense and overwhelming
				   distress that his soul was in. Luke's expression in the text of his
				   being in an agony, according to the signification of that word in the
				   original, implies no common degree of sorrow, but such extreme distress
				   that his nature had a most violent conflict with it, as a man that
				   wrestles with all his might with a strong man, who labours and exerts
				   his utmost strength to gain a conquest over him.
				</p><p>
				   2. From what Christ himself says of it, who was not wont to magnify
				   things beyond the truth. He says, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful even
				   unto death." <reference osisRef="Matt.26.38">Matthew 26:38</reference>. What language can more strongly express the
				   most extreme degree of sorrow? His soul was not only "sorrowful," but
				   "exceeding sorrowful;" and not only so, but because that did not fully
				   express the degree of his sorrow, he adds, "even unto death;" which
				   seems to intimate that the very pains and sorrows of hell, of eternal
				   death, had got hold upon him. The Hebrews were wont to express the
				   utmost degree of sorrow that any creature could be liable to by the
				   phrase, the shadow of death. Christ had now, as it were, the shadow of
				   death brought over his soul by the near view which he had of that
				   bitter cup that was now set before him.
				</p><p>
				   3. From the effect which it had on his body, in causing that bloody
				   sweat that we read of in the text. In our translation it is said, that
				   "his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood, falling down to the
				   ground." The word rendered great drops, is in the original qromboi,
				   which properly signifies lumps or clots; for we may suppose that the
				   blood that was pressed out through the pores of his skin by the
				   violence of that inward struggle and conflict that there was, when it
				   came to be exposed to the cool air of the night, congealed and
				   stiffened, as is the nature of blood, and so fell off from him not in
				   drops, but in clots. If the suffering of Christ had occasioned merely a
				   violent sweat, it would have shown that he was in great agony; for it
				   must be an extraordinary grief and exercise of mind that causes the
				   body to be all of a sweat abroad in the open air, in a cold night as
				   that was, as is evident from <reference osisRef="John.18.18">John 18:18</reference>. "And the servants and officers
				   stood there, who had made a fire of coals, (for it was cold,) and they
				   warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself." This
				   was the same night in which Christ had his agony in the garden. But
				   Christ's inward distress and grief was not merely such as caused him to
				   be in a violent and universal sweat, but such as caused him to sweat
				   blood. The distress and anguish of his mind was so unspeakably extreme
				   as to force his blood through the pores of his skin, and that so
				   plentifully as to fall in great clots or drops from his body to the
				   ground. I come now to show,
				</p><p>
				   IV. What may be supposed to be the special end of God's giving Christ
				   beforehand these terrible views of his last sufferings; in other words,
				   why it was needful that he should have a more full and extraordinary
				   view of the cup that he was to drink, a little before he drank it, than
				   ever he had before; or why he must have such a foretaste of the wrath
				   of God to be endured on the cross, before the time came that he was
				   actually to endure it.
				</p><p>
				   Answer. It was needful, in order that he might take the cup and drink
				   it, as knowing what he did. Unless the human nature of Christ had had
				   an extraordinary view given him beforehand of what he was to suffer, he
				   could not, as man, fully know beforehand what he was going to suffer,
				   and therefore could not, as man, know what he did when he took the cup
				   to drink it, because he would not fully have known what the cup was-it
				   being a cup that he never drank before. If Christ had plunged himself
				   into those dreadful sufferings, without being fully sensible beforehand
				   of their bitterness and dreadfulness, he must have done he knew not
				   what. As man, he would have plunged himself into sufferings of the
				   amount of which he was ignorant, and so have acted blindfold; and of
				   course his taking upon him these sufferings could not have been so
				   fully his own act. Christ, as God, perfectly knew what these sufferings
				   were; but it was more needful also that he should know as man; for he
				   was to suffer as man, and the act of Christ in taking that cup was the
				   act of Christ as God man. But the man Christ Jesus hitherto never had
				   had experience of any such sufferings as he was now to endure on the
				   cross; and therefore he could not fully know what they were beforehand,
				   but by having an extraordinary view of them set before him, and an
				   extraordinary sense of them impressed on his mind. We have heard of
				   tortures that others have undergone, but we do not fully know what they
				   were, because we never experienced them; and it is impossible that we
				   should fully know what they were but in one of these two ways, either
				   by experiencing them, or by having a view given of them, or a sense of
				   them impressed in an extraordinary way. Such a sense was impressed on
				   the mind of the man Christ Jesus, in the garden of Gethsemane, of his
				   last sufferings, and that caused his agony. When he had a full sight
				   given him what that wrath of God was that he was to suffer, the sight
				   was overwhelming to him; it made his soul exceeding sorrowful, even
				   unto death. Christ was going to be cast into a dreadful furnace of
				   wrath, and it was not proper that he should plunge himself into it
				   blindfold, as not knowing how dreadful the furnace was. Therefore that
				   he might not do so, God first brought him and set him at the mouth of
				   the furnace, that he might look in, and stand and view its fierce and
				   raging flames, and might see where he was going, and might voluntarily
				   enter into it and bear it for sinners, as knowing what it was. This
				   view Christ had in his agony. Then God brought the cup that he was to
				   drink, and set it down before him, that he might have a full view of
				   it, and see what it was before he took it and drank it. If Christ had
				   not fully known what the dreadfulness of these sufferings was, before
				   he took them upon him, his taking them upon him could not have been
				   fully his own act as man; there could have been no explicit act of his
				   will about that which he was ignorant of; there could have been no
				   proper trial, whether he would be willing to undergo such dreadful
				   sufferings or not, unless he had known beforehand how dreadful they
				   were; but when he had seen what they were, by having an extraordinary
				   view given him of them, and then undertaken to endure them afterwards;
				   then he acted as knowing what he did; then his taking that cup, and
				   bearing such dreadful sufferings, was properly his own act by an
				   explicit choice; and so his love to sinners, in that choice of his, was
				   the more wonderful, as also his obedience to God in it. And it was
				   necessary that this extraordinary view that Christ had of the cup he
				   was to drink should be given at that time, just before he was
				   apprehended. This was the most proper season for it, just before he
				   took the cup, and while he yet had opportunity to refuse the cup; for
				   before he was apprehended by the company led by Judas, he had
				   opportunity to make his escape at pleasure. For the place where he was,
				   was without the city, where he was not at all confined, and was a
				   lonesome, solitary place; and it was the night season; so that he might
				   have gone from that place where he would, and his enemies not have
				   known where to have found him. This view that he had of the bitter cup
				   was given him while he was yet fully at liberty, before he was given
				   into the hands of his enemies. Christ's delivering himself up into the
				   hands of his enemies, as he did when Judas came, which was just after
				   his agony, was properly his act of taking the cup in order to drink;
				   for Christ knew that the issue of that would be his crucifixion the
				   next day. These things may show us the end of Christ's agony, and the
				   necessity there was of such an agony before his last sufferings.
				</p>
				<hi type="bold">APPLICATION.</hi>
				<p>
				   1. Hence we may learn how dreadful Christ's last sufferings were. We
				   learn it from the dreadful effect which the bare foresight of them had
				   upon him in his agony. His last sufferings were so dreadful, that the
				   view which Christ had of them before overwhelmed him and amazed him, as
				   it is said he began to be sore amazed. The very sight of these last
				   sufferings was so very dreadful as to sink his soul down into the dark
				   shadow of death; yea, so dreadful was it, that in the sore conflict
				   which his nature had with it, he was all in a sweat of blood, his body
				   all over was covered with clotted blood, and not only his body, but the
				   very ground under him with the blood that fell from him, which had been
				   forced through his pores through the violence of his agony. And if only
				   the foresight of the cup was so dreadful, how dreadful was the cup
				   itself, how far beyond all that can be uttered or conceived! Many of
				   the martyrs have endured extreme tortures, but from what has been said,
				   there is all reason to think those all were a mere nothing to the last
				   sufferings of Christ on the cross. And what has been said affords a
				   convincing argument that the sufferings which Christ endured in his
				   body on the cross, though they were very dreadful, were yet the least
				   part of his last sufferings; and that beside those, he endured
				   sufferings in his soul which were vastly greater. For if it had been
				   only the sufferings which he endured in his body, though they were very
				   dreadful, we cannot conceive that the mere anticipation of them would
				   have such an effect on Christ. Many of the martyrs, for aught we know,
				   have endured as severe tortures in their bodies as Christ did. Many of
				   the martyrs have been crucified, as Christ was; and yet their souls
				   have not been so overwhelmed. There has been no appearance of such
				   amazing sorrow and distress of mind either at the anticipation of their
				   sufferings, or in the actual enduring of them.
				</p><p>
				   2. From what has been said, we may see the wonderful strength of the
				   love of Christ to sinners. What has been said shows the strength of
				   Christ's love two ways.
				</p><p>
				   1. That it was so strong as to carry him through that agony that he was
				   then in. The suffering that he then was actually subject to, was
				   dreadful and amazing, as has been shown; and how wonderful was his love
				   that lasted and was upheld still! The love of any mere man or angel
				   would doubtless have sunk under such a weight, and never would have
				   endured such a conflict in such a bloody sweat as that of Jesus Christ.
				   The anguish of Christ's soul at that time was so strong as to cause
				   that wonderful effect on his body. But his love to his enemies, poor
				   and unworthy as they were, was stronger still. The heart of Christ at
				   that time was full of distress, but it was fuller of love to vile
				   worms: his sorrows abounded, but his love did much more abound.
				   Christ's soul was overwhelmed with a deluge of grief, but this was from
				   a deluge of love to sinners in his heart sufficient to overflow the
				   world, and overwhelm the highest mountains of its sins. Those great
				   drops of blood that fell down to the ground were a manifestation of an
				   ocean of love in Christ's heart.
				</p><p>
				   2. The strength of Christ's love more especially appears in this, that
				   when he had such a full view of the dreadfulness of the cup that he was
				   to drink, that so amazed him, he would notwithstanding even then take
				   it up, and drink it. Then seems to have been the greatest and most
				   peculiar trial of the strength of the love of Christ, when God set down
				   the bitter portion before him, and let him see what he had to drink, if
				   he persisted in his love to sinners; and brought him to the mouth of
				   the furnace that he might see its fierceness, and have a full view of
				   it, and have time then to consider whether he would go in and suffer
				   the flames of this furnace for such unworthy creatures, or not. This
				   was as it were proposing it to Christ's last consideration what he
				   would do; as much as if it had then been said to him, 'Here is the cup
				   that you are to drink, unless you will give up your undertaking for
				   sinners, and even leave them to perish as they deserve. Will you take
				   this cup, and drink it for them, or not? There is the furnace into
				   which you are to be cast, if they are to be saved; either they must
				   perish, or you must endure this for them. There you see how terrible
				   the heat of the furnace is; you see what pain and anguish you must
				   endure on the morrow, unless you give up the cause of sinners. What
				   will you do? is your love such that you will go on? Will you cast
				   yourself into this dreadful furnace of wrath?' Christ's soul was
				   overwhelmed with the thought; his feeble human nature shrunk at the
				   dismal sight. It put him into this dreadful agony which you have heard
				   described; but his love to sinners held out. Christ would not undergo
				   these sufferings needlessly, if sinners could be saved without. If
				   there was not an absolute necessity of his suffering them in order to
				   their salvation, he desired that the cup might pass from him. But if
				   sinners, on whom he had set his love, could not, agreeably to the will
				   of God, be saved without his drinking it, he chose that the will of God
				   should be done. He chose to go on and endure the suffering, awful as it
				   appeared to him. And this was his final conclusion, after the dismal
				   conflict of his poor feeble human nature, after he had had the cup in
				   view, and for at least the space of one hour, had seen how amazing it
				   was. Still he finally resolved that he would bear it, rather than those
				   poor sinners whom he had loved from all eternity should perish. When
				   the dreadful cup was before him, he did not say within himself, why
				   should I, who am so great and glorious a person, infinitely more
				   honourable than all the angels of heaven, Why should I go to plunge
				   myself into such dreadful, amazing torments for worthless wretched
				   worms that cannot be profitable to God, or me, and that deserve to be
				   hated by me, and not to be loved? Why should I, who have been living
				   from all eternity in the enjoyment of the Father's love, go to cast
				   myself into such a furnace for them that never can requite me for it?
				   Why should I yield myself to be thus crushed by the weight of divine
				   wrath, for them who have no love to me, and are my enemies? they do not
				   deserve any union with me, and never did, and never will do, any thing
				   to recommend themselves to me. What shall I be the richer for having
				   saved a number of miserable haters of God and me, who deserve to have
				   divine justice glorified in their destruction? Such, however, was not
				   the language of Christ's heart, in these circumstances; but on the
				   contrary, his love held out, and he resolved even then, in the midst of
				   his agony, to yield himself up to the will of God, and to take the cup
				   and drink it. He would not flee to get out of the way of Judas and
				   those that were with him, though he knew they were coming, but that
				   same hour delivered himself voluntarily into their hands. When they
				   came with swords and staves to apprehend him, and he could have called
				   upon his Father, who would immediately have sent many legions of angels
				   to repel his enemies, and have delivered him, he would not do it; and
				   when his disciples would have made resistance, he would not suffer
				   them, as you may see in <reference osisRef="Matt.26.51">Matthew 26:51</reference>, and onward: "And, behold, one of
				   them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword,
				   and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. Then
				   said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all
				   they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou
				   that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he will presently give me more
				   than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be
				   fulfilled, that thus it must be? In that same hour said Jesus to the
				   multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief, with swords and staves
				   for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye
				   laid no hold on me. But all this was done that the scriptures of the
				   prophets might be fulfilled." And Christ, instead of hiding himself
				   from Judas and the soldiers, told them, when they seemed to be at a
				   loss whether he was the person whom they sought; and when they seemed
				   still somewhat to hesitate, being seized with some terror in their
				   minds, he told them so again, and so yielded himself up into their
				   hands, to be bound by them, after he had shown them that he could
				   easily resist them if he pleased, when a single word spoken by him,
				   threw them backwards to the ground, as you may see in <reference osisRef="John.18.3">John 18:3</reference>, etc.
				   "Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief
				   priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and
				   weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
				   went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus
				   of Nazareth. Jesus said unto them, I am he. As soon then as he had said
				   unto them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground." Thus
				   powerful, constant, and violent was the love of Christ; and the special
				   trial of his love above all others in his whole life seems to have been
				   in the time of his agony. For though his sufferings were greater
				   afterwards, when he was on the cross, yet he saw clearly what those
				   sufferings were to be, in the time of his agony; and that seems to have
				   been the first time that ever Christ Jesus had a clear view what these
				   sufferings were; and after this the trial was not so great, because the
				   conflict was over. His human nature had been in a struggle with his
				   love to sinners, but his love had got the victory. The thing, upon a
				   full view of his sufferings, had been resolved on and concluded; and
				   accordingly, when the moment arrived, he actually went through with
				   those sufferings.
				</p><p>
				   But there are two circumstances of Christ's agony that do still make
				   the strength and constancy of his love to sinners the more conspicuous.
				</p><p>
				   1. That at the same time that he had such a view of the dreadfulness of
				   his sufferings, he had also an extraordinary view of the hatefulness of
				   the wickedness of those for whom those sufferings were to make
				   atonement. There are two things that render Christ's love wonderful: 1.
				   That he should be willing to endure sufferings that were so great; and
				   2. That he should be willing to endure them to make atonement for
				   wickedness that was so great. But in order to its being properly said,
				   Christ of his own act and choice endured sufferings that were so great,
				   to make atonement for wickedness that was so great, two things were
				   necessary. 1. That he should have an extraordinary sense how great
				   these sufferings were to be, before he endured them. This was given in
				   his agony. And 2. That he should also at the same time have an
				   extraordinary sense how great and hateful was the wickedness of men for
				   which he suffered to make atonement; or how unworthy those were for
				   whom he died. And both these were given at the same time. When Christ
				   had such an extraordinary sense how bitter his cup was to be, he had
				   much to make him sensible how unworthy and hateful that wickedness of
				   mankind was for which he suffered; because the hateful and malignant
				   nature of that corruption never appeared more fully than in the spite
				   and cruelty of men in these sufferings; and yet his love was such that
				   he went on notwithstanding to suffer for them who were full of such
				   hateful corruption.
				</p><p>
				   It was the corruption and wickedness of men that contrived and effected
				   his death; it was the wickedness of men that agreed with Judas, it was
				   the wickedness of men that betrayed him, and that apprehended him, and
				   bound him, and led him away like a malefactor; it was by men's
				   corruption and wickedness that he was arraigned, and falsely accused,
				   and unjustly judged. It was by men's wickedness that he was reproached,
				   mocked, buffeted, and spit upon. It was by men's wickedness that
				   Barabbas was preferred before him. It was men's wickedness that laid
				   the cross upon him to bear, and that nailed him to it, and put him to
				   so cruel and ignominious a death. This tended to give Christ an
				   extraordinary sense of the greatness and hatefulness of the depravity
				   of mankind.
				</p><p>
				   1. Because hereby in the time of his sufferings he had that depravity
				   set before him as it is, without disguise. When it killed Christ, it
				   appeared in its proper colours. Here Christ saw it in its true nature,
				   which is the utmost hatred and contempt of God; in its ultimate
				   tendency and desire, which is to kill God; and in its greatest
				   aggravation and highest act, which is killing a person that was God.
				</p><p>
				   2. Because in these sufferings he felt the fruits of that wickedness.
				   It was then directly levelled against himself, and exerted itself
				   against him to work his reproach and torment, which tended to impress a
				   stronger sense of its hatefulness on the human nature of Christ. But
				   yet at the same time, so wonderful was the love of Christ to those who
				   exhibited this hateful corruption, that he endured those very
				   sufferings to deliver them from the punishment of that very corruption.
				   The wonderfulness of Christ's dying love appears partly in that he died
				   for those that were so unworthy in themselves, as all mankind have the
				   same kind of corruptions in their hearts, and partly in that he died
				   for those who were not only so wicked, but whose wickedness consists in
				   being enemies to him; so that he did not only die for the wicked, but
				   for his own enemies; and partly in that he was willing to die for his
				   enemies at the same time that he was feeling the fruits of their
				   enmity, while he felt the utmost effects and exertions of their spite
				   against him in the greatest possible contempt and cruelty towards him
				   in his own greatest ignominy, torments, and death; and partly in that
				   he was willing to atone for their being his enemies in these very
				   sufferings, and by that very ignominy, torment, and death that was the
				   fruit of it. The sin and wickedness of men, for which Christ suffered
				   to make atonement, was, as it were, set before Christ in his view.
				</p><p>
				   1. In that this wickedness was but a sample of the wickedness of
				   mankind; for the corruption of all mankind is of the same nature, and
				   the wickedness that is in one man's heart is of the same nature and
				   tendency as in another's. As in water, face answereth to face, so the
				   heart of man to man.
				</p><p>
				   2. It is probable that Christ died to make atonement for that
				   individual actual wickedness that wrought his sufferings, that
				   reproached, mocked, buffeted, and crucified him. Some of his
				   crucifiers, for whom he prayed that they might be forgiven, while they
				   were in the very act of crucifying him, were afterwards, in answer to
				   his prayer, converted, by the preaching of Peter; as we have an account
				   of in the 2nd chapter of Acts.
				</p><p>
				   2. Another circumstance of Christ's agony that shows the strength of
				   his love, is the ungrateful carriage of his disciples at that time.
				   Christ's disciples were among those for whom he endured this agony, and
				   among those for whom he was going to endure those last sufferings, of
				   which he now had such dreadful apprehensions. Yet Christ had already
				   given them an interest in the benefits of those sufferings. Their sins
				   had already been forgiven them through that blood that he was going to
				   shed, and they had been infinite gainers already by that dying pity and
				   love which he had to them, and had through his sufferings been
				   distinguished from all the world besides. Christ had put greater honour
				   upon them than any other, by making them his disciples in a more
				   honourable sense than he had done any other. And yet now, when he had
				   that dreadful cup set before him which he was going to drink for them,
				   and was in such an agony at the sight of it, he saw no return on their
				   part but indifference and ingratitude. When he only desired them to
				   watch with him, that he might be comforted in their company, now at
				   this sorrowful moment they fell asleep; and showed that they had not
				   concern enough about it to induce them to keep awake with him even for
				   one hour, though he desired it of them once and again. But yet this
				   ungrateful treatment of theirs, for whom he was to drink the cup of
				   wrath which God had set before him, did not discourage him from taking
				   it, and drinking it for them. His love held out to them; having loved
				   his own, he loved them to the end. He did not say within himself when
				   this cup of trembling was before him, Why should I endure so much for
				   those that are so ungrateful; why should I here wrestle with the
				   expectation of the terrible wrath of God to be borne by me to-morrow,
				   for them that in the mean time have not so much concern for me as to
				   keep awake with me when I desire it of them even for one hour? But on
				   the contrary, with tender and fatherly compassions he excuses this
				   ingratitude of his disciples, and says, <reference osisRef="Matt.26.41">Matthew 26:41</reference>. "Watch and pray,
				   that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but
				   the flesh is weak;" and went and was apprehended, and mocked, and
				   scourged, and crucified, and poured out his soul unto death, under the
				   heavy weight of God's dreadful wrath on the cross for them.
				</p><p>
				   3rd Inference. From what has been said, we may learn the wonderfulness
				   of Christ's submission to the will of God. Christ, as he was a divine
				   person, was the absolute sovereign of heaven and earth, but yet he was
				   the most wonderful instance of submission to God's sovereignty that
				   ever was. When he had such a view of the terribleness of his last
				   sufferings, and prayed if it were possible that that cup might pass
				   from him, i.e. if there was not an absolute necessity of it in order to
				   the salvation of sinners, yet it was with a perfect submission to the
				   will of God. He adds, "Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done."
				   He chose rather that the inclination of his human nature, which so much
				   dreaded such exquisite torments, should be crossed, than that God's
				   will should not take place. He delighted in the thought of God's will
				   being done; and when he went and prayed the second time, he had nothing
				   else to say but, "O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me except
				   I drink it, thy will be done;" and so the third time. What are such
				   trials of submission as any of us sometimes have in the afflictions
				   that we suffer in comparison of this? If God does but in his providence
				   signify it to be his will that we should part with a child, how hardly
				   are we brought to yield to it, how ready to be unsubmissive and
				   froward! Or if God lays his hand upon us in some acute pain of body,
				   how ready are we to be discontented and impatient; when the innocent
				   Son of God, who deserved no suffering could quietly submit to
				   sufferings inconceivably great, and say it over and over, God's will be
				   done! When he was brought and set before that dreadful furnace of wrath
				   into which he was to be cast, in order that he might look into it and
				   have a full view of its fierceness, when his flesh shrunk at it, and
				   his nature was in such a conflict, that his body was all covered with a
				   sweat of blood falling in great drops to the ground, yet his soul
				   quietly yielded that the will of God should be done, rather than the
				   will or inclination of his human nature.
				</p><p>
				   4th Infer. What has been said on this subject also shows us the glory
				   of Christ's obedience. Christ was subject to the moral law as Adam was,
				   and he was also subject to the ceremonial and judicial laws of Moses;
				   but the principal command that he had received of the Father was, that
				   he should lay down his life, that he should voluntarily yield up
				   himself to those terrible sufferings on the cross. To do this was his
				   principal errand into the world; and doubtless the principal command
				   that he received, was about that which was the principal errand on
				   which he was sent. The Father, when he sent him into the world, sent
				   him with commands concerning what he should do in the world; and his
				   chief command of all was about that, which was the errand he was
				   chiefly sent upon, which was to lay down his life. And therefore this
				   command was the principal trial of his obedience. It was the greatest
				   trial of his obedience, because it was by far the most difficult
				   command: all the rest were easy in comparison of this. And the main
				   trial that Christ had, whether he would obey this command, was in the
				   time of his agony; for that was within an hour before he was
				   apprehended in order to his sufferings, when he must either yield
				   himself up to them, or fly from them. And then it was the first time
				   that Christ had a full view of the difficulty of this command; which
				   appeared so great as to cause that bloody sweat. Then was the conflict
				   of weak human nature with the difficulty, then was the sore struggles
				   and wrestling with the heavy trial he had, and then Christ got the
				   victory over the temptation, from the dread of his human nature. His
				   obedience held out through the conflict. Then we may suppose that Satan
				   was especially let loose to set in with the natural dread that the
				   human nature had of such torments, and to strive to his utmost to
				   dissuade Christ from going on to drink the bitter cup; for about that
				   time, towards the close of Christ's life, was he especially delivered
				   up into the hands of Satan to be tempted of him, more than he was
				   immediately after his baptism; for Christ says, speaking of that time,
				   <reference osisRef="Luke.22.53">Luke 22:53</reference>. "When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched
				   forth no hands against me; but this is your hour, and the power of
				   darkness." So that Christ, in the time of his agony, was wrestling not
				   only with overwhelming views of his last sufferings, but he also
				   wrestled, in that bloody sweat, with principalities and powers - he
				   contended at that time with the great leviathan that laboured to his
				   utmost to tempt him to disobedience. So that then Christ had
				   temptations every way to draw him off from obedience to God. He had
				   temptations from his feeble human nature, that exceedingly dreaded such
				   torments; and he had temptations from men, who were his enemies; and he
				   had temptations from the ungrateful carriage of his own disciples; and
				   he had temptations from the devil. He had also an overwhelming trial
				   from the manifestation of God's own wrath; when, in the words of
				   Isaiah, it pleased the Lord to bruise him and put him to grief. But yet
				   he failed not, but got the victory over all, and performed that great
				   act of obedience at that time to that same God that hid himself from
				   him, and was showing his wrath to him for men's sins, which he must
				   presently suffer. Nothing could move him away from his steadfast
				   obedience to God, but he persisted in saying, "Thy will be done:"
				   expressing not only his submission, but his obedience; not only his
				   compliance with the disposing will of God, but also with his preceptive
				   will. God had given him this cup to drink, and had commanded him to
				   drink it, and that was reason enough with him to drink it; hence he
				   says, at the conclusion of his agony, when Judas came with his band,
				   "The cup which my Father giveth me to drink, shall I not drink it?"
				   <reference osisRef="John.18.11">John 18:11</reference>. Christ, at the time of his agony, had an inconceivably
				   greater trial of obedience than any man or any angel ever had. How much
				   was this trial of the obedience of the second Adam beyond the trial of
				   the obedience of the first Adam! How light was our first father's
				   temptation in comparison of this! And yet our first surety failed, and
				   our second failed not, but obtained a glorious victory, and went and
				   became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Thus wonderful
				   and glorious was the obedience of Christ, by which he wrought out
				   righteousness for believers, and which obedience is imputed to them. No
				   wonder that it is a sweet penalty sown, and that God stands ready to
				   bestow heaven as its reward on all that believe on him.
				</p><p>
				   5. What has been said shows us the sottishness of secure sinners in
				   being so fearless of the wrath of God. If the wrath of God was so
				   dreadful, that, when Christ only expected it, his human nature was
				   nearly overwhelmed with the fear of it, and his soul was amazed, and
				   his body all over in a bloody sweat; then how sottish are sinners, who
				   are under the threatening of the same wrath of God, and are condemned
				   to it, and are every moment exposed to it; and yet, instead of
				   manifesting intense apprehension, are quiet and easy, and unconcerned;
				   instead of being sorrowful and very heavy, go about with a light and
				   careless heart; instead of crying out in bitter agony, are often gay
				   and cheerful, and eat and drink, and sleep quietly, and go on in sin,
				   provoking the wrath of God more and more, without any great matter of
				   concern! How stupid and sottish are such persons! Let such senseless
				   sinners consider, that that misery, of which they are in danger from
				   the wrath of God, is infinitely more terrible than that, the fear of
				   which occasioned in Christ his agony and bloody sweat. It is more
				   terrible, both as it differs both in its nature and degree, and also as
				   it differs in its duration. It is more terrible in its nature and
				   degree. Christ suffered that which, as it upheld the honour of the
				   divine law, was fully equivalent to the misery of the damned; and in
				   some respect it was the same suffering; for it was the wrath of the
				   same God; but yet in other respects it vastly differed. The difference
				   does not arise from the difference in the wrath poured out on one and
				   the other, for it is the same wrath, but from the difference of the
				   subject, which may be best illustrated from Christ's own comparison.
				   <reference osisRef="Luke.23.31">Luke 23:31</reference>. "For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be
				   done in the dry?" Here he calls himself the green tree, and wicked men
				   the dry, intimating that the misery that will come on wicked men will
				   be far more dreadful than those sufferings which came on him, and the
				   difference arises from the different nature of the subject. The green
				   tree and the dry are both cast into the fire; but the flames seize and
				   kindle on the dry tree much more fiercely than on the green. The
				   sufferings that Christ endured differ from the misery of the wicked in
				   hell in nature and degree in the following respects.
				</p><p>
				   1. Christ felt not the gnawings of a guilty, condemning conscience.
				</p><p>
				   2. He felt no torment from the reigning of inward corruptions and lusts
				   as the damned do. The wicked in hell are their own tormentors, their
				   lusts are their tormentors, and being without restraint, (for there is
				   no restraining grace in hell,) their lusts will rage like raging flames
				   in their hearts. They shall be tormented with the unrestrained violence
				   of a spirit of envy and malice against God, and against the angels and
				   saints in heaven, and against one another. Now Christ suffered nothing
				   of this.
				</p><p>
				   3. Christ had not to consider that God hated him. The wicked in hell
				   have this to make their misery perfect, they know that God perfectly
				   hates them without the least pity or regard to them, which will fill
				   their souls with inexpressible misery. But it was not so with Christ.
				   God withdrew his comfortable presence from Christ, and hid his face
				   from him, and so poured out his wrath upon him, as made him feel its
				   terrible effects in his soul; but yet he knew at the same time that God
				   did not hate him, but infinitely loved him. He cried out of God's
				   forsaking him, but yet at the same time calls him "My God, my God!"
				   knowing that he was his God still, though he had forsaken him. But the
				   wicked in hell will know that he is not their God, but their judge and
				   irreconcilable enemy.
				</p><p>
				   4. Christ did not suffer despair, as the wicked do in hell. He knew
				   that there would be an end to his sufferings in a few hours; and that
				   after that he should enter into eternal glory. But it will be far
				   otherwise with you that are impenitent; if you die in your present
				   condition, you will be in perfect despair. On these accounts, the
				   misery of the wicked in hell will be immensely more dreadful in nature
				   and degree, than those sufferings with the fears of which Christ's soul
				   was so much overwhelmed.
				</p><p>
				   2. It will infinitely differ in duration. Christ's sufferings lasted
				   but a few hours, and there was an eternal end to them, and eternal
				   glory succeeded. But you that are a secure, senseless sinner, are every
				   day exposed to be cast into everlasting misery, a fire that never shall
				   be quenched. If then the Son of God was in such amazement, in the
				   expectation of what he was to suffer for a few hours, how sottish are
				   you who are continually exposed to sufferings, immensely more dreadful
				   in nature and degree, and that are to be without any end, but which
				   must be endured without any rest day or night for ever and ever! If you
				   had a full sense of the greatness of that misery to which you are
				   exposed, and how dreadful your present condition is on that account, it
				   would this moment put you into as dreadful an agony as that which
				   Christ underwent; yea, if your nature could endure it, one much more
				   dreadful. We should now see you fall down in a bloody sweat, wallowing
				   in your gore, and crying out in terrible amazement.
				</p><p>
				   Having thus endeavoured to explain and illustrate the former of the two
				   propositions mentioned in the commencement of this discourse, I shall
				   now proceed to show,
				</p><p>
				   II. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden was in a great
				   and earnest strife and conflict in his prayer to God. The labour and
				   striving of Christ's soul in prayer was a part of his agony, and was
				   without doubt a part of what is intended in the text, when it is said
				   that Christ was in an agony; for, as we have shown, the word is
				   especially used in Scripture in other places for striving or wrestling
				   with God in prayer. From this fact, and from the evangelist mentioning
				   his being in agony, and his praying earnestly in the same sentence, we
				   may well understand him as mentioning his striving in prayer as part of
				   his agony. The words of the text seem to hold forth as much as that
				   Christ was in an agony in prayer: "Being in an agony, he prayed more
				   earnestly; and his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling
				   to the ground." This language seems to imply thus much, that the labour
				   and earnestness of Christ's soul was so great in his wrestling with God
				   in prayer, that he was in a mere agony, and all over in a sweat of
				   blood.
				</p><p>
				   What I propose now, in this second proposition, is by the help of God
				   to explain this part of Christ's agony which consisted in the agonizing
				   and wrestling of his soul in prayer; which is the more worthy of a
				   particular inquiry, being that which probably is but little understood;
				   though, as may appear in the sequel, the right understanding of it is
				   of great use and consequence in divinity. It is not as I conceive
				   ordinarily well understood what is meant when it is said in the text
				   that Christ prayed more earnestly; or what was the thing that he
				   wrestled with God for, or what was the subject matter of this earnest
				   prayer, or what was the reason of his being so very earnest in prayer
				   at this time. And therefore, to set this whole matter in a clear light,
				   I would particularly inquire,
				</p><p>
				   1. Of what nature this prayer was;
				</p><p>
				   2. What was the subject matter of this earnest prayer of Christ to the
				   Father;
				</p><p>
				   3. In what capacity Christ offered up this prayer to God;
				</p><p>
				   4. Why he was so earnest in his prayer;
				</p><p>
				   5. What was the success of this his earnest wrestling with God in
				   prayer; and then make some improvement.
				</p><p>
				   I. Of what nature this prayer of Christ was.
				</p><p>
				   Addresses that are made to God may be of various kinds. Some are
				   confessions on the part of the individual, or expressions of his sense
				   of his own unworthiness before God, and are thus penitential addresses
				   to God. Others are doxologies or prayers intended to express the sense
				   which the person has of God's greatness and glory. Such are many of the
				   psalms of David. Others are gratulatory addresses, or expressions of
				   thanksgiving and praise for mercies received. Others are submissive
				   addresses, or expressions of submission and resignation to the will of
				   God, whereby he that addresses the Majesty of heaven, expresses the
				   compliance of his will with the sovereign will of God; saying, "Thy
				   will, O Lord, be done!" as David, <reference osisRef="2Sam.15.26">2 Samuel 15:26</reference>. "But if he thus say, I
				   have no delight in thee; behold, here am I; let him do to me as seemeth
				   good unto him." Others are petitory or supplicatory; whereby the person
				   that prays, begs of God and cries to him for some favour desired of
				   him.
				</p><p>
				   Hence the inquiry is, of which of these kinds was the prayer of Christ,
				   that we read of in the text.
				</p><p>
				   Answer. It was chiefly supplicatory. It was not penitential or
				   confessional; for Christ had no sin or unworthiness to confess. Nor was
				   it a doxology or a thanksgiving or merely an expression of submission;
				   for none of these agree with what is said in the text, viz. that he
				   prayed more earnestly. When any one is said to pray earnestly, it
				   implies an earnest request for some benefit, or favour desired; and not
				   merely a confession, or submission, or gratulation. So what the apostle
				   says of this prayer, in <reference osisRef="Heb.5.7">Hebrews 5:7</reference>. "Who in the days of his flesh, when
				   he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and
				   tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard, in
				   that he feared," shows that it was petitory, or an earnest supplication
				   for some desired benefit. They are not confessions, or doxologies, or
				   thanksgivings. or resignations, that are called "supplications" and
				   "strong cyings," but petitions for some benefit earnestly desired. And
				   having thus resolved the first inquiry, and shown that this earnest
				   prayer of Christ -was of the nature of a supplication for some benefit
				   or favour which Christ earnestly desired, I come to inquire,
				</p><p>
				   II. What was the subject matter of this supplication; or what favour
				   and benefit that was for which Christ so earnestly supplicated in this
				   prayer of which we have an account in the text. Now the words of the
				   text are not express on this matter. It is said that Christ, "being in
				   an agony, prayed more earnestly;" but yet it is not said what he prayed
				   so earnestly for. And here is the greatest difficulty attending this
				   account: even what that was which Christ so earnestly desired, for
				   which he so wrestled with God at that time. And though we are not
				   expressly told in the text, yet the Scriptures have not left us without
				   sufficient light in this matter. And the more effectually to avoid
				   mistakes, I would answer,
				</p><p>
				   1. Negatively, the thing that Christ so earnestly prayed for at this
				   time, was not that the bitter cup which he had to drink might pass from
				   him. Christ had before prayed for this, as in the next verse but one
				   before the text, saying "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup
				   from me! nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done!" It is after
				   this that we have an account that Christ being in an agony, prayed more
				   earnestly; but we are not to understand that he prayed more earnestly
				   than he had done before, that the cup might pass from him. That this
				   was not the thing that he so earnestly prayed for in this second
				   prayer, the following things seem to prove:
				</p><p>
				   1. This second prayer was after the angel had appeared to him from
				   heaven, strengthening him, the more cheerfully to take the cup and
				   drink it. The evangelists inform us that when Christ came into the
				   garden, he began to be sorrowful, and very heavy, and that he said his
				   soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, and that then he went
				   and prayed to God, that if it were possible the cup might pass from
				   him. Luke says in the 41st and 42nd verses, "that being withdrawn from
				   his disciples about a stone's cast, he kneeled down and prayed, saying,
				   Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not
				   my will, but thine be done!" And then, after this, it is said in the
				   next verse, that there appeared an angel from heaven unto him
				   strengthening him. Now this can be understood no otherwise than that
				   the angel appeared to him, strengthening him and encouraging him to go
				   through his great and difficult work, to take the cup and drink it.
				   Accordingly we must suppose, that now Christ was more strengthened and
				   encouraged to go through with his sufferings: and therefore we cannot
				   suppose that after this he would pray more earnestly than before to be
				   delivered from his sufferings; and of course that it was something else
				   that Christ more earnestly prayed for, after that strengthening of the
				   angel, and not that the cup might pass from him. Though Christ seems to
				   have a greater sight of his sufferings given him after this
				   strengthening of the angel than before, that caused such an agony, yet
				   he was more strengthened to fit him for a greater sight of them, he had
				   greater strength and courage to grapple with these awful apprehensions,
				   than before. His strength to bear sufferings is increased with the
				   sense of his sufferings.
				</p><p>
				   2. Christ, before his second prayer, had had an intimation from the
				   Father, that it was not his will that the cup should pass from him. The
				   angel's coming from heaven to strengthen him must be so understood.
				   Christ first prays, that if it may be the will of the Father, the cup
				   might pass; but not, if it was not his will; and then God immediately
				   upon this sends an angel to strengthen, and encourage him to take the
				   cup, which was a plain intimation to Christ that it was the Father's
				   will that he should take it, and that it should not pass from him. And
				   so Christ received it; as appears from the account which Matthew gives
				   of this second prayer. <reference osisRef="Matt.26.42">Matthew 26:42</reference>. "He went away again the second time
				   and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me
				   except I drink it, thy will be done." He speaks as one that now had had
				   an intimation, since he prayed before, that it was not the will of God.
				   And Luke tells us how, viz. by God's sending an angel. Matthew informs
				   us, as Luke does, that in his first prayer, he prayed that if it were
				   possible the cup might pass from him; but then God sends an angel to
				   signify that it was not his will, and to encourage him to take it. And
				   then Christ having received this plain intimation that it was not the
				   will of God that the cup should pass from him, yields to the message he
				   had received, and says, O my Father, if it be so as thou hast now
				   signified, thy will be done. Therefore we may surely conclude that what
				   Christ prayed more earnestly for after this, was not that the cup might
				   pass from him, but something else; for he would not go to pray more
				   earnestly that the cup might pass from him, after God had signified
				   that it was not his will that it should pass from him, than he did
				   before; that would be blasphemous to suppose. And then,
				</p><p>
				   3dly, The language of the second prayer, as recited by Matthew, "O my
				   Father, if this cup may not pass from me except I drink it, thy will be
				   done," shows that Christ did not then pray that the cup might pass from
				   him. This certainly is not praying more earnestly that the cup might
				   pass: it is rather a yielding that point, and ceasing any more to urge
				   it, and submitting to it as a thing now determined by the will of God,
				   made known by the angel. And,
				</p><p>
				   4. From the apostle's account of this prayer in the 5th ch. of Hebrews,
				   the words of the apostle are these, "Who in the days of his flesh, when
				   he had offered up his prayers and supplications, with strong crying and
				   tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in
				   that he feared." The strong crying and tears of which the apostle
				   speaks, are doubtless the same that Luke speaks of in the text, when he
				   says, "he being in an agony, prayed more earnestly;" for this was the
				   sharpest and most earnest crying of Christ, of which we have any where
				   any account. But according to the apostle's account, that which Christ
				   feared, and that for which he so strongly cried to God in this prayer,
				   was something that he was heard in, something that God granted him his
				   request in, and therefore it was not that the cup might pass from him.
				   Having thus shown what it was not that Christ prayed for in this
				   earnest prayer, I proceed to show,
				</p><p>
				   2nd, What it was that Christ so earnestly sought of God in this prayer.
				</p><p>
				   I answer in one word, it was, That God's will might be done, in what
				   related to his sufferings. Matthew gives this express account of it, in
				   the very language of the prayer which has been recited several times
				   already, "O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink
				   it, thy will be done!" This is a yielding, and an expression of
				   submission; but it is not merely that. Such words, "The will of the
				   Lord be done," as they are most commonly used, are not understood as a
				   supplication or request, but only as an expression of submission. But
				   the words are not always to be understood in that sense in Scripture,
				   but sometimes are to be understood as a request. So they are to be
				   understood in the third petition of the Lord's prayer, "Thy will be
				   done in earth as in heaven." There the words are to be understood both
				   as an expression of submission, and also a request, as they are
				   explained in the Assembly's Catechism, and so the words are to be
				   understood here. The evangelist Mark says that Christ went away again
				   and spake the same words that he had done in his first prayer. <reference osisRef="Mark.14.39">Mark 14:39</reference>. But then we must understand it as of the same words with the
				   latter part of his first prayer, "nevertheless not my will but thine be
				   done," as Matthew's more full and particular account shows. So that the
				   thing mentioned in the text, for which Christ was wrestling with God in
				   this prayer, was, that God's will might be done in what related to his
				   sufferings.
				</p><p>
				   But then here another inquiry may arise, viz. What is implied in
				   Christ's praying that God's will might be done in what related to his
				   sufferings? To this I answer,
				</p><p>
				   1. This implies a request that he might be strengthened and supported,
				   and enabled to do God's will, by going through with these sufferings.
				   The same as when he says, "Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is
				   written of me, to do thy will, O God." It was the preceptive will of
				   God that he should take that cup and drink it: it was the Father's
				   command to him. The Father had given him the cup, and as it were set it
				   down before him with the command that he should drink it. This was the
				   greatest act of obedience that Christ was to perform. He prays for
				   strength and help, that his poor feeble human nature might be
				   supported, that he might not fail in this great trial, that he might
				   not sink and be swallowed up, and his strength so overcome that he
				   should not hold out, and finish the appointed obedience. This was the
				   thing that he feared, of which the apostle speaks in the 5th of
				   Hebrews, when he says,"he was heard in that he feared." When he had
				   such an extraordinary sense of the dreadfulness of his sufferings
				   impressed on his mind, the fearfulness of it amazed him. He was afraid
				   lest his poor feeble strength should be overcome, and that he should
				   fail in so great a trial, that he should be swallowed up by that death
				   that he was to die, and so should not be saved from death; and
				   therefore he offered up strong crying and tears unto him that was able
				   to strengthen him, and support, and save him from death, that the death
				   he was to suffer might not overcome his love and obedience, but that he
				   might overcome death, and so be saved from it. If Christ's courage had
				   failed in the trial, and he had not held out under his dying
				   sufferings, he never would have been saved from death, but he would
				   have sunk in the deep mire; he never would have risen from the dead,
				   for his rising from the dead was a reward of his victory. If his
				   courage had failed, and he had given up, he would have remained from
				   under the power of death, and so we should all have perished, we should
				   have remained yet in our sins. If he had failed, all would have failed.
				   If he had not overcome in that sore conflict, neither he nor we could
				   have been freed from death, we all must have perished together.
				   Therefore this was the saving from death that the apostle speaks of,
				   that Christ feared and prayed for with strong crying and tears. His
				   being overcome of death was the thing that he feared, and so he was
				   heard in that he feared. This Christ prayed, that the will of God might
				   be done in his sufferings, even that he might not fail of obeying God's
				   will in his sufferings; and therefore it follows in the next verse in
				   that passage of Hebrews, "Though he were a Son, yet learned he
				   obedience by the things which he suffered." That it was in this respect
				   that Christ in his agony so earnestly prayed that the will of God might
				   be done, viz. that he might have strength to do his will, and might not
				   sink and fail in such great sufferings; is confirmed from the
				   scriptures of the Old Testament, as particularly from the 69th Psalm.
				   The psalmist represents Christ in that psalm, as is evident from the
				   fact that the words of that psalm are represented as Christ's words in
				   many places of the New Testament. That psalm is represented as Christ's
				   prayer to God when his soul was overwhelmed with sorrow and amazement,
				   as it was in his agony; as you may see in the 1st and 2nd verses, "Save
				   me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul: I sink in deep
				   mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the
				   floods overflow me." But then the thing that is represented as being
				   the thing that he feared, was failing, and being overwhelmed, in this
				   great trial: verses 14 and 15. "Deliver me out of the mire, and let me
				   not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the
				   deep waters. Let not the water- flood overflow me, neither let the deep
				   swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me." So again in
				   the 22d Psalm, which is also represented as the prayer of Christ under
				   his dreadful sorrow and sufferings, verses 19, 20, 21. "But be not thou
				   far from me, O Lord; O my Strength, haste thee to help me. Deliver my
				   soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. Save me from
				   the lion's mouth." It was meet and suitable that Christ, when about to
				   engage in that terrible conflict, should thus earnestly seek help from
				   God to enable him to do his will; for he needed God's help-the
				   strength of his human nature, without divine help, was not sufficient
				   to carry him through. This was, without doubt, that in which the first
				   Adam failed in his first trial, that when the trial came he was not
				   sensible of his own weakness and dependence. If he had been, and had
				   leaned on God, and cried to him for his assistance and strength against
				   the temptation, in all likelihood we should have remained innocent and
				   happy creatures to this day.
				</p><p>
				   2. It implies a request that God's will and purpose might be obtained
				   in the effects and fruits of his sufferings, in the glory to his name,
				   that was his design in them; and particularly in the glory of his
				   grace, in the eternal salvation and happiness of his elect. This is
				   confirmed by <reference osisRef="John.12.27 John.12.28">John 12:27-28</reference>. "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I
				   say?- Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto
				   this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from
				   heaven, saying, I have both glorified, and will glorify it again."
				   There the first request is the same with the first request of Christ
				   here in like trouble: "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
				   Father, save me from this hour." He first prays, as he does here, that
				   he might be saved from his last sufferings. Then, after he was
				   determined within himself that the will of God must be otherwise, that
				   he should not be saved from that hour, "but for this cause," says he,
				   "came I to this hour;" and then his second request after this is,
				   "Father, glorify thy name!" So this is doubtless the purport of the
				   second request in his agony, when he prayed that God's will might be
				   done. It is that God's will might be done in that glory to his own name
				   that he intended in the effects and fruits of his sufferings, that
				   seeing that it was his will that he should suffer, he earnestly prays
				   that the end of his suffering, in the glory of God and the salvation of
				   the elect, may not fail. And these things are what Christ so earnestly
				   wrestled with God for in his prayer, of which we have an account in the
				   text, and we have no reason to think that they were not expressed in
				   prayer as well as implied. It is not reasonable to suppose that the
				   evangelist in his other account of things mentions all the words of
				   Christ's prayer. He only mentions the substance.
				</p><p>
				   III. In what capacity did Christ offer up those earnest prayers to God
				   in his agony?
				</p><p>
				   In answer to this inquiry, I observe that he offered them up not as a
				   private person, but as high priest. The apostle speaks of the strong
				   crying and tears, as what Christ offered up as high priest. <reference osisRef="Heb.5.6 Heb.5.7">Hebrews 5:6-7</reference>.
				   "As he says also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever, after
				   the order of Melchisedek: who in the days of his flesh, when he had
				   offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears,"
				   etc. The things that Christ prayed for in those strong cryings, were
				   things not of a private nature, but of common concern to the whole
				   church of which he was the high priest. That the will of God should be
				   done in his obedience unto death, that his strength and courage should
				   not fail, but that he should hold out, was of common concern; for, if
				   he had failed, all would have failed and perished for ever. And of
				   course, that God's name should be glorified in the effects and fruits
				   of his sufferings, and in the salvation and glory of all his elect, was
				   a thing of common concern. Christ offered up these strong cries with
				   his flesh in the same manner as the priests of old were wont to offer
				   up prayers with their sacrifices. Christ mixed strong crying and tears
				   with his blood, and so offered up his blood and his prayers together,
				   that the effect and success of his blood might be obtained. Such
				   earnest agonizing prayers were offered with his blood, and his
				   infinitely precious and meritorious blood was offered with his prayers.
				</p><p>
				   IV. Why was Christ so earnest in those supplications? Luke speaks of
				   them as very earnest; the apostle speaks of them as strong crying; and
				   his agony partly consisted in this earnestness: and the account that
				   Luke gives us, seems to imply that his bloody sweat was partly at least
				   with the great labour and earnest sense of his soul in wrestling with
				   God in prayer. There were three things that concurred at that time,
				   especially to cause Christ to be thus earnest and engaged.
				</p><p>
				   1. He had then an extraordinary sense how dreadful the consequence
				   would be, if God's will should fail of being done. He had then an
				   extraordinary sense of his own last suffering under the wrath of God,
				   and if he had failed in those sufferings, he knew the consequence must
				   be dreadful. He having now such an extraordinary view of the
				   terribleness of the wrath of God, his love to the elect tended to make
				   him more than ordinarily earnest that they might be delivered from
				   suffering that wrath to all eternity, which could not have been if he
				   had failed of doing God's will, or if the will of God in the effect of
				   his suffering had failed.
				</p><p>
				   2. No wonder that that extraordinary sense that Christ then had of the
				   costliness of the means of sinners' salvation, made him very earnest
				   for the success of those means, as you have already heard.
				</p><p>
				   3. Christ had an extraordinary sense of his dependence on God, and his
				   need of his help to enable him to do God's will in this great trial.
				   Though he was innocent, yet he needed divine help. He was dependent on
				   God, as man, and therefore we read that he trusted in God. <reference osisRef="Matt.27.43">Matthew 27:43</reference>.
				   "He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for
				   he said, I am the Son of God." And when he had such an extraordinary
				   sight of the dreadfulness of that wrath he was to suffer, he saw how
				   much it was beyond the strength of his human nature alone.
				</p><p>
				   V. What was the success of this prayer of Christ?
				</p><p>
				   To this I answer, He obtained all his requests. The apostle says, "He
				   was heard in that he feared;" in all that he feared. He obtained
				   strength and help from God, all that he needed, and was carried
				   through. He was enabled to do and to suffer the whole will of God; and
				   he obtained the whole of the end of his sufferings-a full atonement
				   for the sins of the whole world, and the full salvation of every one of
				   those who were given him in the covenant of redemption, and all that
				   glory to the name of God, which his mediation was designed to
				   accomplish, not one jot or tittle hath failed. Herein Christ in his
				   agony was above all others Jacob's antitype, in his wrestling with God
				   for a blessing; which Jacob did, not as a private person, but as the
				   head of his posterity, the nation of Israel, and by which he obtained
				   that commendation of God, "As a prince thou hast power with God;" and
				   therein was a type of him who was the Prince of princes.

				<hi type="bold">APPLICATION.</hi>
				<p>
				   Great improvement may be made of the consideration of the strong crying
				   and tears of Christ in the days of his flesh, many ways for our
				   benefit.
				</p><p>
				   1. This may teach us after what manner we should pray to God, not in a
				   cold and careless manner, but with great earnestness and engagedness of
				   spirit, and especially when we are praying to God for those things that
				   are of infinite importance, such as spiritual and eternal blessings.
				   Such were the benefits that Christ prayed for with such strong crying
				   and tears, that he might be enabled to do God's will in that great and
				   difficult work that God had appointed him, that he might not sink and
				   fail, but might get the victory, and so finally be delivered from
				   death, and that God's will and end might be obtained as the fruit of
				   his sufferings, in the glory of God, and the salvation of the elect.
				</p><p>
				   When we go before God in prayer with a cold, dull heart, and in a
				   lifeless and listless manner pray to him for eternal blessings, and
				   those of infinite import to our souls, we should think of Christ's
				   earnest prayers that he poured out to God, with tears and a bloody
				   sweat. The consideration of it may well make us ashamed of our dull,
				   lifeless prayers to God, wherein, indeed, we rather ask a denial than
				   ask to be heard; for the language of such a manner of praying to God,
				   is, that we do not look upon the benefit that we pray for as of any
				   great importance, that we are indifferent whether God answers us or
				   not. The example of Jacob in wrestling with God for the blessing,
				   should teach us earnestness in our prayers, but more especially the
				   example of Jesus Christ, who wrestled with God in a bloody sweat. If we
				   were sensible as Christ was of the great importance of those benefits
				   that are of eternal consequence, our prayers to God for such benefits
				   would be after another manner than now they are. Our souls also would
				   with earnest labour and strife be engaged in this duty.
				</p><p>
				   There are many benefits that we ask of God in our prayers, which are
				   every whit of as great importance to us as those benefits which Christ
				   asked of God in his agony were to him. It is of as great importance to
				   us that we should be enabled to do the will of God, and perform a
				   sincere, universal, and persevering obedience to his commands, as it
				   was to Christ that he should not fail of doing God's will in his great
				   work. It is of as great importance to us to be saved from death, as it
				   was to Christ that he should get the victory over death, and so be
				   saved from it. It is of as great, and infinitely greater, importance to
				   us, that Christ's redemption should be successful in us, as it was to
				   him that God's will should be done, in the fruits and success of his
				   redemption.
				</p><p>
				   Christ recommended earnest watchfulness and prayerfulness to his
				   disciples, by prayer and example, both at the same time. When Christ
				   was in his agony, and came and found his disciples asleep, he bid them
				   watch and pray, <reference osisRef="Matt.26.41">Matthew 26:41</reference>. "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
				   temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." At
				   the same time he set them an example of that which he commanded them,
				   for though they slept he watched, and poured out his soul in those
				   earnest prayers that you have heard of; and Christ has elsewhere taught
				   us to ask those blessings of God that are of infinite importance, as
				   those that will take no denial. We have another example of the great
				   conflicts and engagedness of Christ's spirit in this duty. <reference osisRef="Luke.6.12">Luke 6:12</reference>.
				   "And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to
				   pray, and continued all night in prayer to God." And he was often
				   recommending earnestness in crying to God in prayers. In the parable of
				   the unjust judge, Luke 18 at the beginning; "And he spake a parable
				   unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
				   saying There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
				   regarded man; and there was a widow in that city; and she came unto
				   him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not for awhile:
				   but afterwards he saith within himself, Though I fear not God nor
				   regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her,
				   lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what
				   the unjust judge saith." <reference osisRef="Luke.6.5">Luke 6:5</reference>, etc. "And he said unto them, Which
				   of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say
				   unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his
				   journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? And he
				   from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut,
				   and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say
				   unto you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his
				   friend, yet because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as
				   many as he needeth." He taught it in his own way of answering prayer,
				   as in answering the woman of Canaan, <reference osisRef="Matt.15.22">Matthew 15:22</reference>, etc. "And behold a
				   woman of Canaan came out of the coasts, and cried unto him, saying,
				   Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously
				   vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples
				   came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
				   But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
				   house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help
				   me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's
				   bread and cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat
				   of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. Then Jesus answered
				   and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as
				   thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour." And as
				   Christ prayed in his agony, so I have already mentioned several texts
				   of Scripture wherein we are directed to agonize in our prayers to God.
				</p><p>
				   2. These earnest prayers and strong cries of Christ to the Father in
				   his agony, show the greatness of his love to sinners. For, as has been
				   shown, these strong cries of Jesus Christ were what he offered up to
				   God as a public person, in the capacity of high priest, and in the
				   behalf of those whose priest he was. When he offered up his sacrifice
				   for sinners whom he had loved from eternity, he withal offered up
				   earnest prayers. His strong cries, his tears, and his blood, were all
				   offered up together to God, and they were all offered up for the same
				   end, for the glory of God in the salvation of the elect. They were all
				   offered up for the same persons, viz. for his people. For them he shed
				   his blood and that bloody sweat, when it fell down in clotted lumps to
				   the ground; and for them he so earnestly cried to God at the same time.
				   It was that the will of God might be done in the success of his
				   sufferings, in the success of that blood, in the salvation of those for
				   whom that blood was shed, and therefore this strong crying shows his
				   strong love; it shows how greatly he desired the salvation of sinners.
				   He cried to God that he might not sink and fail in that great
				   undertaking, because if he did so, sinners could not be saved, but all
				   must perish. He prayed that he might get the victory over death,
				   because if he did not get the victory, his people could never obtain
				   that victory, and they can conquer no otherwise than by his conquest.
				   If the Captain of our salvation had not conquered in this sore
				   conflict, none of us could have conquered, but we must have all sunk
				   with him. He cried to God that he might be saved from death, and if he
				   had not been saved from death in his resurrection, none of us could
				   ever have been saved from death. It was a great sight to see Christ in
				   that great conflict that he was in in his agony, but every thing in it
				   was from love, that strong love that was in his heart. His tears that
				   flowed from his eyes were from love; his great sweat was from love; his
				   blood, his prostrating himself on the ground before the Father, was
				   from love; his earnest crying to God was from the strength and ardency
				   of his love. It is looked upon as one principal way wherein true love
				   and good will is shown in christian friends one towards another,
				   heartily to pray one for another; and it is one way wherein Christ
				   directs us to show our love to our enemies, even praying for them.
				   <reference osisRef="Matt.5.44">Matthew 5:44</reference>. "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that
				   curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute
				   you." But was there ever any prayer that manifested love to enemies to
				   such a degree, as those strong cries and tears of the Son of God for
				   the success of his blood in the salvation of his enemies; the strife
				   and conflict of whose soul in prayer was such as to produce his agony
				   and his bloody sweat?
				</p><p>
				   3. If Christ was thus earnest in prayer to God, that the end of his
				   sufferings might be obtained in the salvation of sinners, then how much
				   ought those sinners to be reproved that do not earnestly seek their own
				   salvation! If Christ offered up such strong cries for sinners as their
				   high priest, that bought their salvation, who stood in no need of
				   sinners, who had been happy from all eternity without them, and could
				   not be made happier by them; then how great is the sottishness of those
				   sinners that seek their own salvation in a dull and lifeless manner;
				   that content themselves with a formal attendance on the duties of
				   religion, with their hearts in the mean time much more earnestly set
				   after other things! They after a sort attend on the duty of social
				   prayer, wherein they pray to God that he would have mercy on them and
				   save them; but after what a poor dull way is it that they do it! they
				   do not apply their heart unto wisdom, nor incline their ear to
				   understanding; they do not cry after wisdom, nor lift up their voice
				   for understanding; they do not seek it as silver, nor search for it as
				   for hidden treasures. Christ's earnest cries in his agony may convince
				   us that it was not without reason that he insisted upon it, in <reference osisRef="Luke.13.24">Luke 13:24</reference>. that we should strive to enter in at the strait gate, which, as
				   I have already observed to you, is, in the original, Agwnizesqe,
				   "Agonize to enter in at the strait gate." If sinners would be in a
				   hopeful way to obtain their salvation, they should agonize in that
				   great concern as men that are taking a city by violence, as <reference osisRef="Matt.11.12">Matthew 11:12</reference>. "And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
				   heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force." When a
				   body of resolute soldiers are attempting to take a strong city in which
				   they meet with great opposition, what violent conflicts are there
				   before the city is taken! How do the soldiers press on against the very
				   mouths of the enemies' cannon, and upon the points of their swords!
				   When the soldiers are scaling the walls, and making their first
				   entrance into the city, what a violent struggle is there between them
				   and their enemies that strive to keep them out! How do they, as it
				   were, agonize with all their strength! So ought we to seek our
				   salvation, if we would be in a likely way to obtain it. How great is
				   the folly then of those who content themselves with seeking with a cold
				   and lifeless frame of spirit, and so continue from month to month, and
				   from year to year, and yet flatter themselves that they shall be
				   successful!
				</p><p>
				   How much more still are they to be reproved, who are not in a way of
				   seeking their salvation at all, but wholly neglect their precious
				   souls, and attend the duties of religion no further than is just
				   necessary to keep up their credit among men; and instead of pressing
				   into the kingdom of God, are rather violently pressing on towards their
				   own destruction and ruin, being hurried on by their many head strong
				   lusts, as the herd of swine were hurried on by the legion of devils,
				   and ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the
				   waters! <reference osisRef="Matt.8.32">Matthew 8:32</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   4. From what has been said under this proposition, we may learn after
				   what manner Christians ought to go through the work that is before
				   them. Christ had a great work before him when that took place, of which
				   we have an account in the text. Though it was very near the close of
				   his life, yet he then, when his agony began, had the chief part of the
				   work before him that he came into the world to do; which was to offer
				   up that sacrifice which he offered in his last sufferings, and therein
				   to perform the greatest act of his obedience to God. And so the
				   Christians have a great work to do, a service they are to perform to
				   God, that is attended with great difficulty. They have a race set
				   before them that they have to run, a warfare that is appointed them.
				   Christ was the subject of a very great trial in the time of his agony;
				   so God is wont to exercise his people with great trials. Christ met
				   with great opposition in that work that he had to do; so believers are
				   like to meet with great opposition in running the race that is set
				   before them. Christ, as man, had a feeble nature, that was in itself
				   very insufficient to sustain such a conflict, or to support such a load
				   as was coming upon him. So the saints have the same weak human nature,
				   and beside that, great sinful infirmities that Christ had not, which
				   lay them under great disadvantages, and greatly enhance the difficulty
				   of their work. Those great tribulations and difficulties that were
				   before Christ, were the way in which he was to enter into the kingdom
				   of heaven; so his followers must expect, "through much tribulation to
				   enter into the kingdom of heaven." The cross was to Christ the way to
				   the crown of glory, and so it is to his disciples. The circumstances of
				   Christ and of his followers in those things are alike, their case,
				   therefore, is the same; and therefore Christ's behaviour under those
				   circumstances, was a fit example for them to follow. They should look
				   to their Captain, and observe after what manner he went through his
				   great work, and the great tribulations which he endured. They should
				   observe after what manner he entered into the kingdom of heaven, and
				   obtained the crown of glory, and so they also should run the race that
				   is set before them. "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with
				   so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the
				   sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the
				   race that is set before us. Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher
				   of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him, endured the
				   cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
				   throne of God." Particularly,
				</p><p>
				   (1.) When others are asleep they should be awake, as it was with
				   Christ. The time of Christ's agony was the night season, the time
				   wherein persons were wont to be asleep: it was the time wherein the
				   disciples that were about Christ were asleep; but Christ then had
				   something else to do than to sleep; he had a great work to do; he kept
				   awake, with his heart engaged in this work. So should it be with the
				   believers of Christ; when the souls of their neighbours are asleep in
				   their sins, and under the power of a lethargic insensibility and sloth,
				   they should watch and pray, and maintain a lively sense of the infinite
				   importance of their spiritual concerns. <reference osisRef="1Thess.5.6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</reference>. "Therefore let us
				   not sleep, as do others, but let us watch and be sober."
				</p><p>
				   (2.) They should go through their work with earnest labour, as Christ
				   did. The time when others were asleep was a time when Christ was about
				   his great work, and was engaged in it with all his might, agonizing in
				   it; conflicting and wrestling, in tears, and in blood. So should
				   Christians with the utmost earnestness improve their time with souls
				   engaged in this work, pushing through the opposition they meet with in
				   it, pushing through all difficulties and sufferings there are in the
				   way, running with patience the race set before them, conflicting with
				   the enemies of their souls with all their might; as those that wrestle
				   not with flesh and blood, but with principalities and powers, and the
				   rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high
				   places.
				</p><p>
				   (3.) This labour and strife should be, that God may be glorified, and
				   their own eternal happiness obtained in a way of doing God's will. Thus
				   it was with Christ: what he so earnestly strove for was, that he might
				   do the will of God, that he might keep his command, his difficult
				   command, without failing in it, and that in this way God's will might
				   be done, in that glory to his ever great name, and that salvation to
				   his elect that he intended by his sufferings. Here is an example for
				   the saints to follow in that holy strife, and race, and warfare, which
				   God has appointed them; they should strive to do the will of their
				   heavenly Father, that they may, as the apostle expresses it, <reference osisRef="Rom.12.2">Romans 12:2</reference>.
				   "Prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God," and
				   that in this way they may glorify God, and may come at last to be happy
				   for ever in the enjoyment of God.
				</p><p>
				   (4.) In all the great work they have to do, their eye should be to God
				   for his help to enable them to overcome. Thus did the man Christ Jesus:
				   he strove in his work even to such an agony and bloody sweat. But how
				   did he strive? It was not in his own strength, but his eyes were to
				   God, he cries unto him for his help and strength to uphold him, that he
				   might not fail; he watched and prayed, as he desired his disciples to
				   do; he wrestled with his enemies and with his great sufferings, but at
				   the same time wrestled with God to obtain his help, to enable him to
				   get the victory. Thus the saints should use their strength in their
				   christian course to the utmost, but not as depending on their own
				   strength, but crying mightily to God for his strength to make them
				   conquerors.
				</p><p>
				   (5.) In this way they should hold out to the end as Christ did. Christ
				   in this way was successful, and obtained the victory, and won the
				   prize; he overcame, and is set down with the Father in his throne. So
				   Christians should persevere and hold out in their great work to the
				   end; they should continue to run their race till they have come to the
				   end of it; they should be faithful unto the death as Christ was; and
				   then, when they have overcome, they shall sit down with him in his
				   throne. <reference osisRef="Rev.3.21">Revelation of John 3:21</reference>. "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me
				   in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father
				   in his throne."
				</p><p>
				   5. Hence burdened and distressed sinners, if any such are here present,
				   may have abundant ground of encouragement to come to Christ for
				   salvation. Here is great encouragement to sinners to come to this high
				   priest that offered up such strong crying and tears with his blood, for
				   the success of his sufferings in the salvation of sinners. For,
				</p><p>
				   1st, Here is great ground of assurance that Christ stands ready to
				   accept of sinners, and bestow salvation upon them; for those strong
				   cries of his that he offered up in the capacity of our high priest,
				   show how earnestly desirous he was of it. If he was not willing that
				   sinners should be saved, be they ever so unworthy of it, then why would
				   he so wrestle with God for it in such a bloody sweat? Would any one so
				   earnestly cry to God with such costly cries, in such great labour and
				   travail of soul, for that, that he did not desire that God should
				   bestow? No, surely! but this shows how greatly his heart was set on the
				   success of his redemption; and therefore since he has by such earnest
				   prayers, and by such a bloody sweat, obtained salvation of the Father
				   to bestow on sinners, he will surely be ready to bestow it upon them,
				   if they come to him for it; otherwise he will frustrate his own design;
				   and he that so earnestly cried to God that his design might not be
				   frustrated, will not, after all, frustrate it himself.
				</p><p>
				   2. Here is the strongest ground of assurance that God stands ready to
				   accept of all those that come to him for mercy through Christ, for this
				   is what Christ prayed for in those earnest prayers, whose prayers were
				   always heard, as Christ says, <reference osisRef="John.11.42">John 11:42</reference>. "And I knew that thou hearest
				   me always." And especially may they conclude, that heard their high
				   priest in those strong cries that he offered up with his blood, and
				   that especially on the following account.
				</p><p>
				   (1.) They were the most earnest prayers that ever were made. Jacob was
				   very earnest when he wrestled with God; and many others have wrestled
				   with God with many tears; yea, doubtless, many of the saints have
				   wrestled with God with such inward labour and strife as to produce
				   powerful effects on the body. But so earnest was Christ, so strong was
				   the labour and fervency of his heart, that he cried to God in a sweat
				   of blood; so that if any earnestness and importunity in prayer ever
				   prevailed with God, we may conclude that that prevailed.
				</p><p>
				   (2.) He who then prayed was the most worthy person that ever put up a
				   prayer. He had more worthiness than ever men or angels had in the sight
				   of God, according as by inheritance he has obtained a more excellent
				   name than they; for he was the only-begotten Son of God, infinitely
				   lovely in his sight, the Son in whom he declared once and again he was
				   well-pleased. He was infinitely near and dear to God, and had more
				   worthiness in his eyes ten thousand times than all men and angels put
				   together. And can we suppose any other than that such a person was
				   heard when he cried to God with such earnestness? Did Jacob, a poor
				   sinful man, when he had wrestled with God, obtain of God the name of
				   ISRAEL, and that encomium, that as a prince he had power with God, and
				   prevailed? And did Elijah, who was a man of like passions, and of like
				   corruptions with us, when he prayed, earnestly prevail on God to work
				   such great wonders? And shall not the only-begotten Son of God, when
				   wrestling with God in tears and blood, prevail, and have his request
				   granted him?
				</p><p>
				   Surely there is no room to suppose any such thing; and therefore, there
				   is no room to doubt whether God will bestow salvation on those that
				   believe in him, at his request.
				</p><p>
				   (3.) Christ offered up these earnest prayers with the best plea for an
				   answer that ever was offered to God, viz. his own blood; which was an
				   equivalent for the thing that he asked. He not only offered up strong
				   cries, but he offered them up with a price fully sufficient to purchase
				   the benefit he asked.
				</p><p>
				   (4.) Christ offered this price and those strong cries both together;
				   for at the same time that he was pouring out these earnest requests for
				   the success of his redemption in the salvation of sinners, he also shed
				   his blood. His blood fell down to the ground at the same instant that
				   his cries went up to heaven. Let burdened and distressed sinners, that
				   are ready to doubt of the efficacy of Christ's intercession for such
				   unworthy creatures as they, and to call in question God's readiness to
				   accept them for Christ's sake, consider these things. Go to the garden
				   where the Son of God was in an agony, and where he cried to God so
				   earnestly, and where his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood,
				   and then see what a conclusion you will draw up from such a wonderful
				   sight.
				</p><p>
				   6. The godly may take great comfort in this, that Christ has as their
				   high priest offered up such strong cries to God. You that have good
				   evidence of your being believers in Christ, and his true followers and
				   servants, may comfort yourselves in this, that Christ Jesus is your
				   high priest, that that blood, which Christ shed in his agony, fell down
				   to the ground for you, and that those earnest cries were sent up to God
				   for you, for the success of his labours and sufferings in all that good
				   you stood in need of in this world, and in your everlasting happiness
				   in the world to come. This may be a comfort to you in all losses, and
				   under all difficulties, that you may encourage your faith, and
				   strengthen your hope, and cause you greatly to rejoice. If you were
				   under any remarkable difficulties, it would be a great comfort to you
				   to have the prayers of some man that you looked upon to be a man of
				   eminent piety, and one that had a great interest at the throne of
				   grace, and especially if you knew that he was very earnest and greatly
				   engaged in prayer for you. But how much more may you be comforted in
				   it, that you have an interest in the prayers and cries of the
				   only-begotten and infinitely worthy Son of God, and that he was so
				   earnest in his prayers for you, as you have heard!
				</p><p>
				   7. Hence we may learn how earnest Christians ought to be in their
				   prayers and endeavours for the salvation of others. Christians are the
				   followers of Christ, and they should follow him in this. We see from
				   what we have heard, how great the labour and travail of Christ's soul
				   was for others' salvation, and what earnest and strong cries to God
				   accompanied his labours. Here he hath set us an example. Herein he hath
				   set an example for ministers, who should as co-workers with Christ
				   travail in birth with them till Christ be found in them. <reference osisRef="Gal.4.19">Galatians 4:19</reference>. "My
				   little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be
				   formed in you." They should be willing to spend and be spent for them.
				   They should not only labour for them, and pray earnestly for them, but
				   should, if occasion required, be ready to suffer for them, and to spend
				   not only their strength, but their blood for them. <reference osisRef="2Cor.12.15">2 Corinthians 12:15</reference>. "And I
				   will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the more abundantly
				   I love you, the less I be loved." Here is an example for parents,
				   showing how they ought to labour and cry to God for the spiritual good
				   of their children. You see how Christ laboured and strove and cried to
				   God for the salvation of his spiritual children; and will not you
				   earnestly seek and cry to God for your natural children?
				</p><p>
				   Here is an example for neighbours one towards another how they should
				   seek and cry for the good of one another's souls, for this is the
				   command of Christ, that they should love one another as Christ loved
				   them. <reference osisRef="John.15.12">John 15:12</reference>. Here is an example for us, showing how we should
				   earnestly seek and pray for the spiritual and eternal good of our
				   enemies, for Christ did all this for his enemies, and when some of
				   those enemies were at that very instant plotting his death, and busily
				   contriving to satiate their malice and cruelty, in his most extreme
				   torments, and most ignominious destruction.

					A Sermon
				  by
				Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
				    Sermon IV of Seventeen Occasional Sermons, in The Works of Jonathan Edwards,
				    Volume Two, The Banner of Truth Trust, Reprinted 1995, pp. 849-854.
				</p><p>
				  <reference osisRef="Rom.9.18">Romans 9:18</reference> - Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
				  will he hardeneth.
				</p><p>
				   THE apostle, in the beginning of this chapter, expresses his great
				   concern and sorrow of heart for the nation of the Jews, who were
				   rejected of God. This leads him to observe the difference which God
				   made by election between some of the Jews and others, and between the
				   bulk of that people and the christian Gentiles. In speaking of this he
				   enters into a more minute discussion of the sovereignty of God in
				   electing some to eternal life, and rejecting others, than is found in
				   any other part of the Bible; in the course of which he quotes several
				   passages from the Old Testament, confirming and illustrating this
				   doctrine. In the ninth verse he refers us to what God said to Abraham,
				   showing his election of Isaac before Ishmael - "For this is the word of
				   promise; At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son:" then to
				   what God had said to Rebecca, showing his election of Jacob before
				   Esau; "The elder shall serve the younger:" in the thirteenth verse, to
				   a passage from Malachi, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated:" in
				   the fifteenth verse, to what God said to Moses, "I will have mercy on
				   whom I will have mercy; and I will have compassion on whom I will have
				   compassion:" and the verse preceding the text, to what God says to
				   Pharaoh, "For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same
				   purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and
				   that my name might be declared throughout all the earth." In what the
				   apostle says in the text, he seems to have respect especially to the
				   two last-cited passages: to what God said to Moses in the fifteenth
				   verse, and to what he said to Pharaoh in the verse immediately
				   preceding. God said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have
				   mercy." To this the apostle refers in the former part of the text. And
				   we know how often it is said of Pharaoh, that God hardened his heart.
				   And to this the apostle seems to have respect in the latter part of the
				   text; "and whom he will he hardeneth." We may observe in the text,
				</p><p>
				   1. God's different dealing with men. He hath mercy on some, and
				   hardeneth others. When God is here spoken of as hardening some of the
				   children of men, it is not to be understood that God by any positive
				   efficiency hardens any man's heart. There is no positive act in God, as
				   though he put forth any power to harden the heart. To suppose any such
				   thing would be to make God the immediate author of sin. God is said to
				   harden men in two ways: by withholding the powerful influences of his
				   Spirit, without which their hearts will remain hardened, and grow
				   harder and harder; in this sense he hardens them, as he leaves them to
				   hardness. And again, by ordering those things in his providence which,
				   through the abuse of their corruption, become the occasion of their
				   hardening. Thus God sends his word and ordinances to men which, by
				   their abuse, prove an occasion of their hardening. So the apostle said,
				   that he was unto some "a savour of death unto death." So God is
				   represented as sending Isaiah on this errand, to make the hearts of the
				   people fat, and to make their ears heavy, and to shut their eyes; lest
				   they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
				   understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. <reference osisRef="Isa.6.10">Isaiah 6:10</reference>.
				   Isaiah's preaching was, in itself, of a contrary tendency, to make them
				   better. But their abuse of it rendered it an occasion of their
				   hardening. As God is here said to harden men, so he is said to put a
				   lying spirit in the mouth of the false prophets. <reference osisRef="2Chr.18.22">2 Chronicles 18:22</reference>. That
				   is, he suffered a lying spirit to enter into them. And thus he is said
				   to have bid Shimei curse David. <reference osisRef="2Sam.16.10">2 Samuel 16:10</reference>. Not that he properly
				   commanded him; for it is contrary to God's commands. God expressly
				   forbids cursing the ruler of the people. <reference osisRef="Exod.22.28">Exodus 22:28</reference>. But he suffered
				   corruption at that time so to work in Shimei, and ordered that occasion
				   of stirring it up, as a manifestation of his displeasure against David.
				</p><p>
				   2. The foundation of his different dealing with mankind; viz. his
				   sovereign will and pleasure. "He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy,
				   and whom he will he hardeneth." This does not imply, merely, that God
				   never shows mercy or denies it against his will, or that he is always
				   willing to do it when he does it. A willing subject or servant, when he
				   obeys his lord's commands, may never do any thing against his will,
				   nothing but what he can do cheerfully and with delight; and yet he
				   cannot be said to do what he wills in the sense of the text. But the
				   expression implies that it is God's mere will and sovereign pleasure,
				   which supremely orders this affair. It is the divine will without
				   restraint, or constraint, or obligation.
				</p><p>
				   Doctrine. God exercises his sovereignty in the eternal salvation of
				   men.
				</p><p>
				   He not only is sovereign, and has a sovereign right to dispose and
				   order in that affair; and he not only might proceed in a sovereign way,
				   if he would, and nobody could charge him with exceeding his right; but
				   he actually does so; he exercises the right which he has. In the
				   following discourse, I propose to show,
				</p><p>
				   [38]I. [1] What is God's sovereignty.
				   [39]II. What God's sovereignty in the salvation of men implies.
				   [40]III. That God actually doth exercise his sovereignty in this
				   matter.
				   [41]IV. The reasons for this exercise.
				</p><p>
				   I. I would show what is God's sovereignty.
				</p><p>
				   The sovereignty of God is his absolute, independent right of disposing
				   of all creatures according to his own pleasure. I will consider this
				   definition by the parts of it.
				</p><p>
				   The will of God is called his mere pleasure,
				</p><p>
				   1. In opposition to any constraint. Men may do things voluntarily, and
				   yet there may be a degree of constraint. A man may be said to do a
				   thing voluntarily, that is, he himself does it; and, all things
				   considered, he may choose to do it; yet he may do it out of fear, and
				   the thing in itself considered be irksome to him, and sorely against
				   his inclination. When men do things thus, they cannot be said to do
				   them according to their mere pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   2. In opposition to its being under the will of another. A servant may
				   fulfil his master's commands, and may do it willingly, and cheerfully,
				   and may delight to do his master's will; yet when he does so, he does
				   not do it of his own mere pleasure. The saints do the will of God
				   freely. They choose to do it; it is their meat and drink. Yet they do
				   not do it of their mere pleasure and arbitrary will; because their will
				   is under the direction of a superior will.
				</p><p>
				   3. In opposition to any proper obligation. A man may do a thing which
				   he is obliged to do, very freely; but he cannot be said to act from his
				   own mere will and pleasure. He who acts from his own mere pleasure, is
				   at full liberty; but he who is under any proper obligation, is not at
				   liberty, but is bound. Now the sovereignty of God supposes, that he has
				   a right to dispose of all his creatures according to his mere pleasure
				   in the sense explained. And his right is absolute and independent. Men
				   may have a right to dispose of some things according to their pleasure.
				   But their right is not absolute and unlimited. Men may be said to have
				   a right to dispose of their own goods as they please. But their right
				   is not absolute; is has limits and bounds. They have a right to dispose
				   of their own goods as they please, provided they do not do it contrary
				   to the law of the state to which they are subject, or contrary to the
				   law of God. Men's right to dispose of their things as they will, is not
				   absolute, because it is not independent. They have not an independent
				   right to what they have, but in some things depend on the community to
				   which they belong, for the right they have; and in every thing depend
				   on God. They receive all the right they have to any thing from God. But
				   the sovereignty of God imports that he has an absolute, and unlimited,
				   and independent right of disposing of his creatures as he will. I
				   proposed to inquire,
				</p><p>
				   II. What God's sovereignty in the salvation of men implies. In answer
				   to this inquiry, I observe, it implies that God can either bestow
				   salvation on any of the children of men, or refuse it, without any
				   prejudice to the glory of any of his attributes, except where he has
				   been pleased to declare, that he will or will not bestow it. It cannot
				   be said absolutely, as the case now stands, that God can, without any
				   prejudice to the honour of any of his attributes, bestow salvation on
				   any of the children of men, or refuse it; because, concerning some, God
				   has been pleased to declare either that he will or that he will not
				   bestow salvation on them; and thus to bind himself by his own promise.
				   And concerning some he has been pleased to declare, that he never will
				   bestow salvation upon them; viz. those who have committed the sin
				   against the Holy Ghost. Hence, as the case now stands, he is obliged;
				   he cannot bestow salvation in one case, or refuse it in the other,
				   without prejudice to the honour of his truth. But God exercised his
				   sovereignty in making these declarations. God was not obliged to
				   promise that he would save all who believe in Christ; nor was he
				   obliged to declare, that he who committed the sin against the Holy
				   Ghost should never be forgiven. But it pleased him so to declare. And
				   had it not been so that God had been pleased to oblige himself in these
				   cases, he might still have either bestowed salvation, or refused it,
				   without prejudice to any of his attributes. If it would in itself be
				   prejudicial to any of his attributes to bestow or refuse salvation,
				   then God would not in that matter act as absolutely sovereign. Because
				   it then ceases to be a merely arbitrary thing. It ceases to be a matter
				   of absolute liberty, and is become a matter of necessity or obligation.
				   For God cannot do any thing to the prejudice of any of his attributes,
				   or contrary to what is in itself excellent and glorious. Therefore,
				</p><p>
				   1. God can, without prejudice to the glory of any of his attributes,
				   bestow salvation on any of the children of men, except on those who
				   have committed the sin against the Holy Ghost. The case was thus when
				   man fell, and before God revealed his eternal purpose and plan for
				   redeeming men by Jesus Christ. It was probably looked upon by the
				   angels as a thing utterly inconsistent with God's attributes to save
				   any of the children of men. It was utterly inconsistent with the honour
				   of the divine attributes to save any one of the fallen children of men,
				   as they were in themselves. It could not have been done had not God
				   contrived a way consistent with the honour of his holiness, majesty,
				   justice, and truth. But since God in the gospel has revealed that
				   nothing is too hard for him to do, nothing beyond the reach of his
				   power, and wisdom, and sufficiency; and since Christ has wrought out
				   the work of redemption, and fulfilled the law by obeying, there is none
				   of mankind whom he may not save without any prejudice to any of his
				   attributes, excepting those who have committed the sin against the Holy
				   Ghost. And those he might have saved without going contrary to any of
				   his attributes, had he not been pleased to declare that he would not.
				   It was not because he could not have saved them consistently with his
				   justice, and consistently with his law, or because his attribute of
				   mercy was not great enough, or the blood of Christ not sufficient to
				   cleanse from that sin. But it has pleased him for wise reasons to
				   declare that that sin shall never be forgiven in this world, or in the
				   world to come. And so now it is contrary to God's truth to save such.
				   But otherwise there is no sinner, let him be ever so great, but God can
				   save him without prejudice to any attribute; if he has been a murderer,
				   adulterer, or perjurer, or idolater, or blasphemer, God may save him if
				   he pleases, and in no respect injure his glory. Though persons have
				   sinned long, have been obstinate, have committed heinous sins a
				   thousand times, even till they have grown old in sin, and have sinned
				   under great aggravations: let the aggravations be what they may; if
				   they have sinned under ever so great light; if they have been
				   backsliders, and have sinned against ever so numerous and solemn
				   warnings and strivings of the Spirit, and mercies of his common
				   providence: though the danger of such is much greater than of other
				   sinners, yet God can save them if he pleases, for the sake of Christ,
				   without any prejudice to any of his attributes. He may have mercy on
				   whom he will have mercy. He may have mercy on the greatest of sinners,
				   if he pleases, and the glory of none of his attributes will be in the
				   least sullied. Such is the sufficiency of the satisfaction and
				   righteousness of Christ, that none of the divine attributes stand in
				   the way of the salvation of any of them. Thus the glory of any
				   attribute did not at all suffer by Christ's saving some of his
				   crucifiers.
				</p><p>
				   1. God may save any of them without prejudice to the honour of his
				   holiness. God is an infinitely holy being. The heavens are not pure in
				   his sight. He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on
				   iniquity. And if God should in any way countenance sin, and should not
				   give proper testimonies of his hatred of it, and displeasure at it, it
				   would be a prejudice to the honour of his holiness. But God can save
				   the greatest sinner without giving the least countenance to sin. If he
				   saves one, who for a long time has stood out under the calls of the
				   gospel, and has sinned under dreadful aggravations; if he saves one
				   who, against light, has been a pirate or blasphemer, he may do it
				   without giving any countenance to their wickedness; because his
				   abhorrence of it and displeasure against it have been already
				   sufficiently manifested in the sufferings of Christ. It was a
				   sufficient testimony of God's abhorrence against even the greatest
				   wickedness, that Christ, the eternal Son of God, died for it. Nothing
				   can show God's infinite abhorrence of any wickedness more than this. If
				   the wicked man himself should be thrust into hell, and should endure
				   the most extreme torments which are ever suffered there, it would not
				   be a greater manifestation of God's abhorrence of it, than the
				   sufferings of the Son of God for it.
				</p><p>
				   2. God may save any of the children of men without prejudice to the
				   honour of his majesty. If men have affronted God, and that ever so
				   much, if they have cast ever so much contempt on his authority; yet God
				   can save them, if he pleases, and the honour of his majesty not suffer
				   in the least. If God should save those who have affronted him, without
				   satisfaction, the honour of his majesty would suffer. For when contempt
				   is cast upon infinite majesty, its honour suffers, and the contempt
				   leaves an obscurity upon the honour of the divine majesty, if the
				   injury is not repaired. But the sufferings of Christ do fully repair
				   the injury. Let the contempt be ever so great, yet if so honourable a
				   person as Christ undertakes to be a Mediator for the offender, and in
				   the mediation suffer in his stead, it fully repairs the injury done to
				   the majesty of heaven by the greatest sinner.
				</p><p>
				   3. God may save any sinner whatsoever consistently with his justice.
				   The justice of God requires the punishment of sin. God is the Supreme
				   Judge of the world, and he is to judge the world according to the rules
				   of justice. It is not the part of a judge to show favour to the person
				   judged; but he is to determine according to a rule of justice without
				   departing to the right hand or left. God does not show mercy as a
				   judge, but as a sovereign. And therefore when mercy sought the
				   salvation of sinners, the inquiry was how to make the exercise of the
				   mercy of God as a sovereign, and of his strict justice as a judge,
				   agree together. And this is done by the sufferings of Christ, in which
				   sin is punished fully, and justice answered. Christ suffered enough for
				   the punishment of the sins of the greatest sinner that ever lived. So
				   that God, when he judges, may act according to a rule of strict
				   justice, and yet acquit the sinner, if he be in Christ. Justice cannot
				   require any more for any man's sins, than those sufferings of one of
				   the persons in the Trinity, which Christ suffered. <reference osisRef="Rom.3.25 Rom.3.26">Romans 3:25-26</reference>. "Whom
				   God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood; to
				   declare his righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of
				   him which believeth in Christ."
				</p><p>
				   4. God can save any sinner whatsoever, without any prejudice to the
				   honour of his truth. God passed his word, that sin should be punished
				   with death, which is to be understood not only of the first, but of the
				   second death. God can save the greatest sinner consistently with his
				   truth in this threatening. For sin is punished in the sufferings of
				   Christ, inasmuch as he is our surety, and so is legally the same
				   person, and sustained our guilt, and in his sufferings bore our
				   punishment. It may be objected, that God said, If thou eatest, thou
				   shalt die; as though the same person that sinned must suffer; and
				   therefore why does not God's truth oblige him to that? I answer, that
				   the word then was not intended to be restrained to him, that in his own
				   person sinned. Adam probably understood that his posterity were
				   included, whether they sinned in their own person or not. If they
				   sinned in Adam, their surety, those words, "if thou eatest," meant, if
				   thou eatest in thyself, or in thy surety. And therefore, the latter
				   words, "thou shalt die," do also fairly allow of such a construction
				   as, thou shalt die in thyself, or in thy surety. <reference osisRef="Isa.42.21">Isaiah 42:21</reference>. "The Lord
				   is well pleased for his righteousness' sake, he will magnify the law
				   and make it honourable." But,
				</p><p>
				   II. God may refuse salvation to any sinner whatsoever, without
				   prejudice to the honour of any of his attributes.
				</p><p>
				   There is no person whatever in a natural condition, upon whom God may
				   not refuse to bestow salvation without prejudice to any part of his
				   glory. Let a natural person be wise or unwise, of a good or ill natural
				   temper, of mean or honourable parentage, whether born of wicked or
				   godly parents; let him be a moral or immoral person, whatever good he
				   may have done, however religious he has been, how many prayers soever
				   he has made, and whatever pains he has taken that he may be saved;
				   whatever concern and distress he may have for fear he shall be damned;
				   or whatever circumstances he may be in; God can deny him salvation
				   without the least disparagement to any of his perfections. His glory
				   will not in any instance be the least obscured by it.
				</p><p>
				   1. God may deny salvation to any natural person without any injury to
				   the honour of his righteousness. If he does so, there is no injustice
				   nor unfairness in it. There is no natural man living, let his case be
				   what it will, but God may deny him salvation, and cast him down to
				   hell, and yet not be chargeable with the least unrighteous or unfair
				   dealing in any respect whatsoever. This is evident, because they all
				   have deserved hell: and it is no injustice for a proper judge to
				   inflict on any man what he deserves. And as he has deserved
				   condemnation, so he has never done any thing to remove the liability,
				   or to atone for the sin. He never has done any thing whereby he has
				   laid any obligations on God not to punish him as he deserved.
				</p><p>
				   2. God may deny salvation to any unconverted person whatever without
				   any prejudice to the honour of his goodness. Sinners are sometimes
				   ready to flatter themselves, that though it may not be contrary to the
				   justice of God to condemn them, yet it will not consist with the glory
				   of his mercy. They think it will be dishonourable to God's mercy to
				   cast them into hell, and have no pity or compassion upon them. They
				   think it will be very hard and severe, and not becoming a God of
				   infinite grace and tender compassion. But God can deny salvation to any
				   natural person without any disparagement to his mercy and goodness.
				   That, which is not contrary to God's justice, is not contrary to his
				   mercy. If damnation be justice, then mercy may choose its own object.
				   They mistake the nature of the mercy of God, who think that it is an
				   attribute, which, in some cases, is contrary to justice. Nay, God's
				   mercy is illustrated by it, as in the twenty-third verse of the
				   context. "That he might make known the riches of his glory on the
				   vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory."
				</p><p>
				   3. It is in no way prejudicial to the honour of God's faithfulness. For
				   God has in no way obliged himself to any natural man by his word to
				   bestow salvation upon him. Men in a natural condition are not the
				   children of promise; but lie open to the curse of the law, which would
				   not be the case if they had any promise to lay hold of.
				</p><p>
				   III. God does actually exercise his sovereignty in men's salvation.
				</p><p>
				   We shall show how he exercises this right in several particulars.
				</p><p>
				   1. In calling one people or nation, and giving them the means of grace,
				   and leaving others without them. According to the divine appointment,
				   salvation is bestowed in connexion with the means of grace. God may
				   sometimes make use of very unlikely means, and bestow salvation on men
				   who are under very great disadvantages; but he does not bestow grace
				   wholly without any means. But God exercises his sovereignty in
				   bestowing those means. All mankind are by nature in like circumstances
				   towards God. Yet God greatly distinguishes some from others by the
				   means and advantages which he bestows upon them. The savages, who live
				   in the remote parts of this continent, and are under the grossest
				   heathenish darkness, as well as the inhabitants of Africa, are
				   naturally in exactly similar circumstances towards God with us in this
				   land. They are no more alienated or estranged from God in their natures
				   than we; and God has no more to charge them with. And yet what a vast
				   difference has God made between us and them! In this he has exercised
				   his sovereignty. He did this of old, when he chose but one people, to
				   make them his covenant people, and to give them the means of grace, and
				   left all others, and gave them over to heathenish darkness and the
				   tyranny of the devil, to perish from generation to generation for many
				   hundreds of years. The earth in that time was peopled with many great
				   and mighty nations. There were the Egyptians, a people famed for their
				   wisdom. There were also the Assyrians and Chaldeans, who were great,
				   and wise, and powerful nations. There were the Persians, who by their
				   strength and policy subdued a great part of the world. There were the
				   renowned nations of the Greeks and Romans, who were famed over the
				   whole world for their excellent civil governments, for their wisdom and
				   skill in the arts of peace and war, and who by their military prowess
				   in their turns subdued and reigned over the world. Those were rejected.
				   God did not choose them for his people, but left them for many ages
				   under gross heathenish darkness, to perish for lack of vision; and
				   chose one only people, the posterity of Jacob, to be his own people,
				   and to give them the means of grace. <reference osisRef="Ps.147.19 Ps.147.20">Psalms 147:19-20</reference>. "He showeth his
				   word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath
				   not dealt so with any nation; and as for his judgments, they have not
				   known them." This nation were a small, inconsiderable people in
				   comparison with many other people. <reference osisRef="Deut.7.7">Deuteronomy 7:7</reference>. "The Lord did not set his
				   love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any
				   people; for ye were the fewest of all people." So neither was it for
				   their righteousness; for they had no more of that than other people.
				   <reference osisRef="Deut.9.6">Deuteronomy 9:6</reference>. "Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not
				   this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a
				   stiff-necked people." God gives them to understand, that it was from no
				   other cause but his free electing love, that he chose them to be his
				   people. That reason is given why God loved them; it was because he
				   loved them. <reference osisRef="Deut.7.8">Deuteronomy 7:8</reference>. Which is as much as to say, it was agreeable to
				   his sovereign pleasure, to set his love upon you.
				</p><p>
				   God also showed his sovereignty in choosing that people, when other
				   nations were rejected, who came of the same progenitors. Thus the
				   children of Isaac were chosen, when the posterity of Ishmael and other
				   sons of Abraham were rejected. So the children of Jacob were chosen,
				   when the posterity of Esau were rejected: as the apostle observes in
				   the seventh verse, "Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are
				   they all children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:" and again in
				   verses 10, 11, 12, 13. "And not only this; but when Rebekah also had
				   conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; the children moreover being
				   not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the promise of
				   God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that
				   calleth; it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it
				   is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." The apostle has
				   not respect merely to the election of the persons of Isaac and Jacob
				   before Ishmael and Esau; but of their posterity. In the passage,
				   already quoted from Malachi, God has respect to the nations, which were
				   the posterity of Esau and Jacob; <reference osisRef="Mal.1.2 Mal.1.3">Malachi 1:2-3</reference>. "I have loved you, saith
				   the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's
				   brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob; and I hated Esau, and laid
				   his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the
				   wilderness." God showed his sovereignty, when Christ came, in rejecting
				   the Jews, and calling the Gentiles. God rejected that nation who were
				   the children of Abraham according to the flesh, and had been his
				   peculiar people for so many ages, and who alone possessed the one true
				   God, and chose idolatrous heathen before them, and called them to be
				   his people. When the Messiah came, who was born of their nation, and
				   whom they so much expected, he rejected them. He came to his own, and
				   his own received him not. <reference osisRef="John.1.11">John 1:11</reference>. When the glorious dispensation of
				   the gospel came, God passed by the Jews, and called those who had been
				   heathens, to enjoy the privileges of it. They were broken off, that the
				   Gentiles might be graffed on. <reference osisRef="Rom.11.17">Romans 11:17</reference>. She is now called beloved,
				   that was not beloved. And more are the children of the desolate, than
				   the children of the married wife. <reference osisRef="Isa.54.1">Isaiah 54:1</reference>. The natural children of
				   Abraham are rejected, and God raises up children to Abraham of stones.
				   That nation, which was so honoured of God, have now been for many ages
				   rejected, and remain dispersed all over the world, a remarkable
				   monument of divine vengeance. And now God greatly distinguishes some
				   Gentile nations from others, and all according to his sovereign
				   pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   2. God exercises his sovereignty in the advantages he bestows upon
				   particular persons. All need salvation alike, and all are, naturally,
				   alike undeserving of it; but he gives some vastly greater advantages
				   for salvation than others. To some he assigns their place in pious and
				   religious families, where they may be well instructed and educated, and
				   have religious parents to dedicate them to God, and put up many prayers
				   for them. God places some under a more powerful ministry than others,
				   and in places where there are more of the outpourings of the Spirit of
				   God. To some he gives much more of the strivings and the awakening
				   influences of the Spirit, than to others. It is according to his mere
				   sovereign pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   3. God exercises his sovereignty in sometimes bestowing salvation upon
				   the low and mean, and denying it to the wise and great. Christ in his
				   sovereignty passes by the gates of princes and nobles, and enters some
				   cottage and dwells there, and has communion with its obscure
				   inhabitants. God in his sovereignty withheld salvation from the rich
				   man, who fared sumptuously every day, and bestowed it on poor Lazarus,
				   who sat begging at his gate. God in this way pours contempt on princes,
				   and on all their glittering splendour. So God sometimes passes by wise
				   men, men of great understanding, learned and great scholars, and
				   bestows salvation on others of weak understanding, who only comprehend
				   some of the plainer parts of Scripture, and the fundamental principles
				   of the christian religion. Yea, there seem to be fewer great men
				   called, than others. And God in ordering it thus manifests his
				   sovereignty. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.26 1Cor.1.27 1Cor.1.28">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</reference>. "For ye see your calling, brethren, how
				   that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
				   noble, are called. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world
				   to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world
				   to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world,
				   and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which
				   are not, to bring to nought things that are."
				</p><p>
				   4. In bestowing salvation on some who have had few advantages. God
				   sometimes will bless weak means for producing astonishing effects, when
				   more excellent means are not succeeded. God sometimes will withhold
				   salvation from those who are the children of very pious parents, and
				   bestow it on others, who have been brought up in wicked families. Thus
				   we read of a good Abijah in the family of Jeroboam, and of a godly
				   Hezekiah, the son of wicked Ahaz, and of a godly Josiah, the son of a
				   wicked Amon. But on the contrary, of a wicked Amnon and Absalom, the
				   sons of holy David, and that vile Manasseh, the son a good Hezekiah.
				   Sometimes some, who have had eminent means of grace, are rejected, and
				   left to perish, and others, under far less advantages, are saved. Thus
				   the scribes and Pharisees, who had so much light and knowledge of the
				   Scriptures, were mostly rejected, and the poor ignorant publicans
				   saved. The greater part of those, among whom Christ was much
				   conversant, and who heard him preach, and saw him work miracles from
				   day to day, were left; and the woman of Samaria was taken, and many
				   other Samaritans at the same time, who only heard Christ preach, as he
				   occasionally passed through their city. So the woman of Canaan was
				   taken, who was not of the country of the Jews, and but once saw Jesus
				   Christ. So the Jews, who had seen and heard Christ, and saw his
				   miracles, and with whom the apostles laboured so much, were not saved.
				   But the Gentiles, many of them, who, as it were, but transiently heard
				   the glad tidings of salvation, embraced them, and were converted.
				</p><p>
				   5. God exercises his sovereignty in calling some to salvation, who have
				   been very heinously wicked, and leaving others, who have been moral and
				   religious persons. The Pharisees were a very strict sect among the
				   Jews. Their religion was extraordinary. <reference osisRef="Luke.18.11">Luke 18:11</reference>. They were not as
				   other men, extortioners, unjust, or adulterers. There was their
				   morality. They fasted twice a week, and gave tithes of all that they
				   possessed. There was their religion. But yet they were mostly rejected,
				   and the publicans, and harlots, and openly vicious sort of people,
				   entered into the kingdom of God before them. <reference osisRef="Matt.21.31">Matthew 21:31</reference>. The apostle
				   describes his righteousness while a Pharisee. <reference osisRef="Phil.3.6">Philippians 3:6</reference>. "Touching
				   the righteousness which is of the law, blameless." The rich young man,
				   who came kneeling to Christ, saying, Good Master, what shall I do, that
				   I may have eternal life, was a moral person. When Christ bade him keep
				   the commandments, he said, and in his own view with sincerity, "All
				   these have I kept from my youth up." He had obviously been brought up
				   in a good family, and was a youth of such amiable manners and correct
				   deportment, that it is said, "Jesus beholding him, loved him." Still he
				   was left; while the thief, that was crucified with Christ, was chosen
				   and called, even on the cross. God sometimes shows his sovereignty by
				   showing mercy to the chief of sinners, on those who have been
				   murderers, and profaners, and blasphemers. And even when they are old,
				   some are called at the eleventh hour. God sometimes shows the
				   sovereignty of his grace by showing mercy to some, who have spent most
				   of their lives in the service of Satan, and have little left to spend
				   in the service of God.
				</p><p>
				   6. In saving some of those who seek salvation, and not others. Some who
				   seek salvation, as we know both from Scripture and observation, are
				   soon converted; while others seek a long time, and do not obtain at
				   last. God helps some over the mountains and difficulties which are in
				   the way; he subdues Satan, and delivers them from his temptations: but
				   others are ruined by the temptations with which they meet. Some are
				   never thoroughly awakened; while to others God is pleased to give
				   thorough convictions. Some are left to backsliding hearts; others God
				   causes to hold out to the end. Some are brought off from a confidence
				   in their own righteousness; others never get over that obstruction in
				   their way, as long as they live. And some are converted and saved, who
				   never had so great strivings as some who, notwithstanding, perish.
				</p><p>
				   IV. I come now to give the reasons, why God does thus exercise his
				   sovereignty in the eternal salvation of the children of men.
				</p><p>
				   1. It is agreeable to God's design in the creation of the universe to
				   exercise every attribute, and thus to manifest the glory of each of
				   them. God's design in the creation was to glorify himself, or to make a
				   discovery of the essential glory of his nature. It was fit that
				   infinite glory should shine forth; and it was God's original design to
				   make a manifestation of his glory, as it is. Not that it was his design
				   to manifest all his glory to the apprehension of creatures; for it is
				   impossible that the minds of creatures should comprehend it. But it was
				   his design to make a true manifestation of his glory, such as should
				   represent every attribute. If God glorified one attribute, and not
				   another, such manifestation of his glory would be defective; and the
				   representation would not be complete. If all God's attributes are not
				   manifested, the glory of none of them is manifested as it is: for the
				   divine attributes reflect glory on one another. Thus if God's wisdom be
				   manifested, and not his holiness, the glory of his wisdom would not be
				   manifested as it is; for one part of the glory of the attribute of
				   divine wisdom is, that it is a holy wisdom. So if his holiness were
				   manifested, and not his wisdom, the glory of his holiness would not be
				   manifested as it is; for one thing which belongs to the glory of God's
				   holiness is, that it is a wise holiness. So it is with respect to the
				   attributes of mercy and justice. The glory of God's mercy does not
				   appear as it is, unless it is manifested as a just mercy, or as a mercy
				   consistent with justice. And so with respect to God's sovereignty, it
				   reflects glory on all his other attributes. It is part of the glory of
				   God's mercy, that it is sovereign mercy. So all the attributes of God
				   reflect glory on one another. The glory of one attribute cannot be
				   manifested, as it is, without the manifestation of another. One
				   attribute is defective without another, and therefore the manifestation
				   will be defective. Hence it was the will of God to manifest all his
				   attributes. The declarative glory of God in Scripture is often called
				   God's name, because it declares his nature. But if his name does not
				   signify his nature as it is, or does not declare any attribute, it is
				   not a true name. The sovereignty of God is one of his attributes, and a
				   part of his glory. The glory of God eminently appears in his absolute
				   sovereignty over all creatures, great and small. If the glory of a
				   prince be his power and dominion, then the glory of God is his absolute
				   sovereignty. Herein appear God's infinite greatness and highness above
				   all creatures. Therefore it is the will of God to manifest his
				   sovereignty. And his sovereignty, like his other attributes, is
				   manifested in the exercises of it. He glorifies his power in the
				   exercise of power. He glorifies his mercy in the exercise of mercy. So
				   he glorifies his sovereignty in the exercise of sovereignty.
				</p><p>
				   2. The more excellent the creature is over whom God is sovereign, and
				   the greater the matter in which he so appears, the more glorious is his
				   sovereignty. The sovereignty of God in his being sovereign over men, is
				   more glorious than in his being sovereign over the inferior creatures.
				   And his sovereignty over angels is yet more glorious that his
				   sovereignty over men. For the nobler the creature is, still the greater
				   and higher doth God appear in his sovereignty over it. It is a greater
				   honour to a man to have dominion over men, that over beasts; and a
				   still greater honour to have dominion over princes, nobles, and kings,
				   than over ordinary men. So the glory of God's sovereignty appears in
				   that he is sovereign over the souls of men, who are so noble and
				   excellent creatures. God therefore will exercise his sovereignty over
				   them. And the further the dominion of any one extends over another, the
				   greater will be the honour. If a man has dominion over another only in
				   some instances, he is not therein so much exalted, as in having
				   absolute dominion over his life, and fortune, and all he has. So God's
				   sovereignty over men appears glorious, that it extends to every thing
				   which concerns them. He may dispose of them with respect to all that
				   concerns them, according to his own pleasure. His sovereignty appears
				   glorious, that it reaches their most important affairs, even the
				   eternal state and condition of the souls of men. Herein it appears that
				   the sovereignty of God is without bounds or limits, in that it reaches
				   to an affair of such infinite importance. God, therefore, as it is his
				   design to manifest his own glory, will and does exercise his
				   sovereignty towards men, over their souls and bodies, even in this most
				   important matter of their eternal salvation. He has mercy on whom he
				   will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.
				</p>
				<hi type="bold">APPLICATION.</hi>
				<p>
				   1. Hence we learn how absolutely we are dependent on God in this great
				   matter of the eternal salvation of our souls. We are dependent not only
				   on his wisdom to contrive a way to accomplish it, and on his power to
				   bring it to pass, but we are dependent on his mere will and pleasure in
				   the affair. We depend on the sovereign will of God for every thing
				   belonging to it, from the foundation to the top-stone. It was of the
				   sovereign pleasure of God, that he contrived a way to save any of
				   mankind, and gave us Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son, to be our
				   Redeemer. Why did he look on us, and send us a Saviour, and not the
				   fallen angels? It was from the sovereign pleasure of God. It was of his
				   sovereign pleasure what means to appoint. His giving us the Bible, and
				   the ordinances of religion, is of his sovereign grace. His giving those
				   means to us rather than to others, his giving the awakening influences
				   of his Spirit, and his bestowing saving grace, are all of his sovereign
				   pleasure. When he says, "Let there be light in the soul of such an
				   one," it is a word of infinite power and sovereign grace.
				</p><p>
				   2. Let us with the greatest humility adore the awful and absolute
				   sovereignty of God. As we have just shown, it is an eminent attribute
				   of the Divine Being, that he is sovereign over such excellent beings as
				   the souls of men, and that in every respect, even in that of their
				   eternal salvation. The infinite greatness of God, and his exaltation
				   above us, appears in nothing more, than in his sovereignty. It is
				   spoken of in Scripture as a great part of his glory. <reference osisRef="Deut.32.39">Deuteronomy 32:39</reference>. "See
				   now that I, even I, am he, and there is no God with me. I kill, and I
				   make alive; I wound, and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver
				   out of my hand." <reference osisRef="Ps.115.3">Psalms 115:3</reference>. "Our God is in the heavens; he hath done
				   whatsoever he pleased." <reference osisRef="Dan.4.34 Dan.4.35">Daniel 4:34-35</reference>. "Whose dominion is an
				   everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.
				   And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he
				   doeth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and among the
				   inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
				   What doest thou?" Our Lord Jesus Christ praised and glorified the
				   Father for the exercise of his sovereignty in the salvation of men.
				   <reference osisRef="Matt.11.25 Matt.11.26">Matthew 11:25-26</reference>. "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
				   because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
				   revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
				   sight." Let us therefore give God the glory of his sovereignty, as
				   adoring him, whose sovereign will orders all things, beholding
				   ourselves as nothing in comparison with him. Dominion and sovereignty
				   require humble reverence and honour in the subject. The absolute,
				   universal, and unlimited sovereignty of God requires, that we should
				   adore him with all possible humility and reverence. It is impossible
				   that we should go to excess in lowliness and reverence of that Being,
				   who may dispose of us to all eternity, as he pleases.
				</p><p>
				   3. Those who are in a state of salvation are to attribute it to
				   sovereign grace alone, and to give all the praise to him, who maketh
				   them to differ from others. Godliness is no cause for glorying, except
				   it be in God. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.29 1Cor.1.30 1Cor.1.31">1 Corinthians 1:29-31</reference>. "That no flesh should glory in his
				   presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
				   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. That,
				   according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
				   Lord." Such are not, by any means, in any degree to attribute their
				   godliness, their safe and happy state and condition, to any natural
				   difference between them and other men, or to any strength or
				   righteousness of their own. They have no reason to exalt themselves in
				   the least degree; but God is the being whom they should exalt. They
				   should exalt God the Father, who chose them in Christ, who set his love
				   upon them, and gave them salvation, before they were born, and even
				   before the world was. If they inquire, why God set his love on them,
				   and chose them rather than others, if they think they can see any cause
				   out of God, they are greatly mistaken. They should exalt God the Son,
				   who bore their names on his heart, when he came into the world, and
				   hung on the cross, and in whom alone they have righteousness and
				   strength. They should exalt God the Holy Ghost, who of sovereign grace
				   has called them out of darkness into marvellous light; who has by his
				   own immediate and free operation, led them into an understanding of the
				   evil and danger of sin, and brought them off from their own
				   righteousness, and opened their eyes to discover the glory of God, and
				   the wonderful riches of God in Jesus Christ, and has sanctified them,
				   and made them new creatures. When they hear of the wickedness of
				   others, or look upon vicious persons, they should think how wicked they
				   once were, and how much they provoked God, and how they deserved for
				   ever to be left by him to perish in sin, and that it is only sovereign
				   grace which has made the difference. <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.10">1 Corinthians 6:10</reference>. Many sorts of sinners
				   are there enumerated; fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate,
				   abusers of themselves with mankind. And then in the eleventh verse, the
				   apostle tells them, "Such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye
				   are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus,
				   and by the Spirit of our God." The people of God have the greater cause
				   of thankfulness, more reason to love God, who hath bestowed such great
				   and unspeakable mercy upon them of his mere sovereign pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   4. Hence we learn what cause we have to admire the grace of God, that
				   he should condescend to become bound to us by covenant; that he, who is
				   naturally supreme in his dominion over us, who is our absolute
				   proprietor, and may do with us as he pleases, and is under no
				   obligation to us; that he should, as it were, relinquish his absolute
				   freedom, and should cease to be merely sovereign in his dispensations
				   towards believers, when once they have believed in Christ, and should,
				   for their more abundant consolation, become bound. So that they can
				   challenge salvation of this Sovereign; they can demand it through
				   Christ, as a debt. And it would be prejudicial to the glory of God's
				   attributes, to deny it to them; it would be contrary to his justice and
				   faithfulness. What wonderful condescension is it in such a Being, thus
				   to become bound to us, worms of the dust, for our consolation! He bound
				   himself by his word, his promise. But he was not satisfied with that;
				   but that we might have stronger consolation still, he hath bound
				   himself by his oath. <reference osisRef="Heb.6.13">Hebrews 6:13</reference>, etc. "For when God made promise to
				   Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself;
				   saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will
				   multiply thee. And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
				   promise. For men verily swear by the greater; and an oath for
				   confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Wherein God, willing more
				   abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his
				   counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in
				   which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
				   consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
				   before us. Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
				   stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the
				   forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever
				   after the order of Melchisedec."
				</p><p>
				   Let us, therefore, labour to submit to the sovereignty of God. God
				   insists, that his sovereignty be acknowledged by us, and that even in
				   this great matter, a matter which so nearly and infinitely concerns us,
				   as our own eternal salvation. This is the stumbling-block on which
				   thousands fall and perish; and if we go on contending with God about
				   his sovereignty, it will be our eternal ruin. It is absolutely
				   necessary that we should submit to God, as our absolute sovereign, and
				   the sovereign over our souls; as one who may have mercy on whom he will
				   have mercy, and harden whom he will.
				</p><p>
				   5. And lastly. We may make use of this doctrine to guard those who seek
				   salvation from two opposite extremes - presumption and discouragement.
				   Do not presume upon the mercy of God, and so encourage yourself in sin.
				   Many hear that God's mercy is infinite, and therefore think, that if
				   they delay seeking salvation for the present, and seek it hereafter,
				   that God will bestow his grace upon them. But consider, that though
				   God's grace is sufficient, yet he is sovereign, and will use his own
				   pleasure whether he will save you or not. If you put off salvation till
				   hereafter, salvation will not be in your power. It will be as a
				   sovereign God pleases, whether you shall obtain it or not. Seeing,
				   therefore, that in this affair you are so absolutely dependent on God,
				   it is best to follow his direction in seeking it, which is to hear his
				   voice to-day: "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
				   heart." Beware also of discouragement. Take heed of despairing
				   thoughts, because you are a great sinner, because you have persevered
				   so long in sin, have backslidden, and resisted the Holy Ghost. Remember
				   that, let your case be what it may, and you ever so great a sinner, if
				   you have not committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, God can bestow
				   mercy upon you without the least prejudice to the honour of his
				   holiness, which you have offended, or to the honour of his majesty,
				   which you have insulted, or of his justice, which you have made your
				   enemy, or of his truth, or of any of his attributes. Let you be what
				   sinner you may, God can, if he pleases, greatly glorify himself in your
				   salvation.

				<title>GOD GLORIFIED IN MAN'S DEPENDENCE</title>
				<p>
					A Sermon<lb />
					by<lb />
					Jonathan Edwards<lb />
				</p><p>
				      [Preached on the Public Lecture in Boston, July 8, 1731; and published at
				      the desire of several ministers and others in Boston who heard it. - This
				      was the first piece published by Mr. Edwards.]
				</p><p>
				  <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.29 1Cor.1.30 1Cor.1.31">1 Corinthians 1:29-31</reference> - That no flesh should glory in his presence. But
				  of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and
				  righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is
				  written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
				</p><p>
				   THOSE Christians to whom the apostle directed this epistle, dwelt in a
				   part of the world where human wisdom was in great repute; as the
				   apostle observes in the 22nd verse of this chapter, "The Greeks seek
				   after wisdom." Corinth was not far from Athens, that had been for many
				   ages the most famous seat of philosophy and learning in the world. The
				   apostle therefore observes to them, how God by the gospel destroyed,
				   and brought to nought, their wisdom. The learned Grecians, and their
				   great philosophers, by all their wisdom did not know God, they were not
				   able to find out the truth in divine things. But, after they had done
				   their utmost to no effect, it pleased God at length to reveal himself
				   by the gospel, which they accounted foolishness. He " chose the foolish
				   things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the
				   world to confound the things which are mighty, and the base things of
				   the world, and things that are despised, yea, and things which are not,
				   to bring to nought the things that are." And the apostle informs them
				   in the text why he thus did, That no flesh should glory in his
				   presence, etc.- In which words may be observed,
				</p><p>
				   1. What God aims at in the disposition of things in the affair of
				   redemption, viz. that man should not glory in himself, but alone in
				   God; That no flesh should glory in his presence, -that, according as
				   it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
				</p><p>
				   2. How this end is attained in the work of redemption, viz. by that
				   absolute and immediate dependence which men have upon God in that work,
				   for all their good. Inasmuch as,
				</p><p>
				   First, All the good that they have is in and through Christ; He is made
				   unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. All the
				   good of the fallen and redeemed creature is concerned in these four
				   things, and cannot be better distributed than into them; but Christ is
				   each of them to us, and we have none of them any otherwise than in him.
				   He is made of God unto us wisdom: in him are all the proper good and
				   true excellency of the understanding. Wisdom was a thing that the
				   Greeks admired; but Christ is the true light of the world; it is
				   through him alone that true wisdom is imparted to the mind. It is in
				   and by Christ that we have righteousness: it is by being in him that we
				   are justified, have our sins pardoned, and are received as righteous
				   into God's favour. It is by Christ that we have sanctification: we have
				   in him true excellency of heart as well as of understanding; and he is
				   made unto us inherent as well as imputed righteousness. It is by Christ
				   that we have redemption, or the actual deliverance from all misery, and
				   the bestowment of all happiness and glory. Thus we have all our good by
				   Christ, who is God.
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, Another instance wherein our dependence on God for all our
				   good appears, is this, That it is God that has given us Christ, that we
				   might have these benefits through him; he of God is made unto us
				   wisdom, righteousness, etc.
				</p><p>
				   Thirdly, It is of him that we are in Christ Jesus, and come to have an
				   interest in him, and so do receive those blessings which he is made
				   unto us. It is God that gives us faith whereby we close with Christ.
				</p><p>
				   So that in this verse is shown our dependence on each person in the
				   Trinity for all our good. We are dependent on Christ the Son of God, as
				   he is our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We are
				   dependent on the Father, who has given us Christ, and made him to be
				   these things to us. We are dependent on the Holy Ghost, for it is of
				   him that we are in Christ Jesus; it is the Spirit of God that gives
				   faith in him, whereby we receive him,and close with him.
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">DOCTRINE.</hi>
				</p><p>
				   "God is glorified in the work of redemption in this, that there appears
				   in it so absolute and universal a dependence of the redeemed on him."
				   - Here I propose to show, 1st, That there is an absolute and universal
				   dependence of the redeemed on God for all their good. And, 2dly, That
				   God hereby is exalted and glorified in the work of redemption.
				</p><p>
				   I. There is an absolute and universal dependence of the redeemed on
				   God. The nature and contrivance of our redemption is such, that the
				   redeemed are in every thing directly, immediately, and entirely
				   dependent on God: they are dependent on him for all, and are dependent
				   on him every way.
				</p><p>
				   The several ways wherein the dependence of one being may be upon
				   another for its good, and wherein the redeemed of Jesus Christ depend
				   on God for all their good, are these, viz. That they have all their
				   good of him, and that they have all through him, and that they have all
				   in him: That he is the cause and original whence all their good comes,
				   therein it is of him; and that he is the medium by which it is obtained
				   and conveyed, therein they have it through him; and that he is the good
				   itself given and conveyed, therein it is in him. Now those that are
				   redeemed by Jesus Christ do, in all these respects, very directly and
				   entirely depend on God for their all.
				</p><p>
				   First, The redeemed have all their good of God. God is the great author
				   of it. He is the first cause of it; and not only so, but he is the only
				   proper cause. It is of God that we have our Redeemer. It is God that
				   has provided a Saviour for us. Jesus Christ is not only of God in his
				   person, as he is the only-begotten Son of God, but he is from God, as
				   we are concerned in him, and in his office of Mediator. He is the gift
				   of God to us: God chose and anointed him, appointed him his work, and
				   sent him into the world. And as it is God that gives, so it is God that
				   accepts the Saviour. He gives the purchaser, and he affords the thing
				   purchased.
				</p><p>
				   It is of God that Christ becomes ours, that we are brought to him, and
				   are united to him. It is of God that we receive faith to close with
				   him, that we may have an interest in him. <reference osisRef="Eph.2.8">Ephesians 2:8</reference>. "For by grace ye
				   are saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of
				   God." It is of God that we actually receive all the benefits that
				   Christ has purchased. It is God that pardons and justifies, and
				   delivers from going down to hell; and into his favour the redeemed are
				   received, when they are justified. So it is God that delivers from the
				   dominion of sin, cleanses us from our filthiness, and changes us from
				   our deformity. It is of God that the redeemed receive all their true
				   excellency, wisdom, and holiness; and that two ways, viz. as the Holy
				   Ghost by whom these things are immediately wrought is from God,
				   proceeds from him, and is sent by him; and also as the Holy Ghost
				   himself is God, by whose operation and indwelling the knowledge of God
				   and divine things, a holy disposition and all grace, are conferred and
				   upheld. And though means are made use of in conferring grace on men's
				   souls, yet it is of God that we have these means of grace, and it is he
				   that makes them effectual. It is of God that we have the Holy
				   Scriptures; they are his word. It is of God that we have ordinances,
				   and their efficacy depends on the immediate influence of his Spirit.
				   The ministers of the gospel are sent of God, and all their sufficiency
				   is of him.- <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.7">2 Corinthians 4:7</reference>. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels,
				   that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us." Their
				   success depends entirely and absolutely on the immediate blessing and
				   influence of God.
				</p><p>
				   1. The redeemed have all from the grace of God. It was of mere grace
				   that God gave us his only-begotten Son. The grace is great in
				   proportion to the excellency of what is given. The gift was infinitely
				   precious, because it was of a person infinitely worthy, a person of
				   infinite glory; and also because it was of a person infinitely near and
				   dear to God. The grace is great in proportion to the benefit we have
				   given us in him. The benefit is doubly infinite, in that in him we have
				   deliverance from an infinite, because an eternal, misery, and do also
				   receive eternal joy and glory. The grace in bestowing this gift is
				   great in proportion to our unworthiness to whom it is given; instead of
				   deserving such a gift, we merited infinitely ill of God's hands. The
				   grace is great according to the manner of giving, or in proportion to
				   the humiliation and expense of the method and means by which a way is
				   made for our having the gift. He gave him to dwell amongst us; he gave
				   him to us incarnate, or in our nature; and in the like though sinless
				   infirmities. He gave him to us in a low and afflicted state; and not
				   only so, but as slain, that he might be a feast for our souls.
				</p><p>
				   The grace of God in bestowing this gift is most free. It was what God
				   was under no obligation to bestow. He might have rejected fallen man,
				   as he did the fallen angels. It was what we never did any thing to
				   merit; it was given while we were yet enemies, and before we had so
				   much as repented. It was from the love of God who saw no excellency in
				   us to attract it; and it was without expectation of ever being requited
				   for it. And it is from mere grace that the benefits of Christ are
				   applied to such and such particular persons. Those that are called and
				   sanctified are to attribute it alone to the good pleasure of God's
				   goodness, by which they are distinguished. He is sovereign, and hath
				   mercy on whom he will have mercy.
				</p><p>
				   Man hath now a greater dependence on the grace of God than he had
				   before the fall. He depends on the free goodness of God for much more
				   than he did then. Then he depended on God's goodness for conferring the
				   reward of perfect obedience; for God was not obliged to promise and
				   bestow that reward. But now we are dependent on the grace of God for
				   much more; we stand in need of grace, not only to bestow glory upon us,
				   but to deliver us from hell and eternal wrath. Under the first covenant
				   we depended on God's goodness to give us the reward of righteousness;
				   and so we do now; but we stand in need of God's free and sovereign
				   grace to give us that righteousness; to pardon our sin, and release us
				   from the guilt and infinite demerit of it.
				</p><p>
				   And as we are dependent on the goodness of God for more now than under
				   the first covenant, so we are dependent on a much greater, more free
				   and wonderful goodness. We are now more dependent on God's arbitrary
				   and sovereign good pleasure. We were in our first estate dependent on
				   God for holiness. We had our original righteousness from him; but then
				   holiness was not bestowed in such a way of sovereign good pleasure as
				   it is now. Man was created holy, for it became God to create holy all
				   his reasonable creatures. It would have been a disparagement to the
				   holiness of God's nature, if he had made an intelligent creature
				   unholy. But now when fallen man is made holy, it is from mere and
				   arbitrary grace; God may for ever deny holiness to the fallen creature
				   if he pleases, without any disparagement to any of his perfections.
				</p><p>
				   And we are not only indeed more dependent on the grace of God, but our
				   dependence is much more conspicuous, because our own insufficiency and
				   helplessness in ourselves is much more apparent in our fallen and
				   undone state, than it was before we were either sinful or miserable. We
				   are more apparently dependent on God for holiness, because we are first
				   sinful,and utterly polluted,and afterward holy. So the production of
				   the effect is sensible, and its derivation from God more obvious. If
				   man was ever holy and always was so,it would not be so apparent, that
				   he had not holiness necessarily,as an inseparable qualification of
				   human nature. So we are more apparently dependent on free grace for the
				   favour of God, for we are first justly the objects of his displeasure,
				   and afterwards are received into favour. We are more apparently
				   dependent on God for happiness, being first miserable, and afterwards
				   happy. It is more apparently free and without merit in us, because we
				   are actually without any kind of excellency to merit, if there could be
				   any such thing as merit in creature excellency. And we are not only
				   without any true excellency, but are full of, and wholly defiled with,
				   that which is infinitely odious. All our good is more apparently from
				   God, because we are first naked and wholly with- out any good, and
				   afterwards enriched with all good.
				</p><p>
				   2. We receive all from the power of God. Man's redemption is often
				   spoken of as a work of wonderful power as well as grace. The great
				   power of God appears in bringing a sinner from his low state, from the
				   depths of sin and misery, to such an exalted state of holiness and
				   happiness. <reference osisRef="Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:19</reference>. "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power
				   to us- ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
				   power."--
				</p><p>
				   We are dependent on God's power through every step of our redemption.
				   We are dependent on the power of God to convert us, and give faith in
				   Jesus Christ, and the new nature. It is a work of creation: "If any man
				   be in Christ, he is a new creature," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.17">2 Corinthians 5:17</reference>. "We are created in
				   Christ Jesus," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.10">Ephesians 2:10</reference>. The fallen creature cannot attain to true
				   holiness, but by being created again. <reference osisRef="Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:24</reference>. "And that ye put on
				   the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
				   holiness." It is a raising from the dead. <reference osisRef="Col.2.12 Col.2.13">Colossians 2:12-13</reference>. "Wherein also
				   ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who
				   hath raised him from the dead." Yea, it is a more glorious work of
				   power than mere creation, or raising a dead body to life, in that the
				   effect attained is greater and more excellent. That holy and happy
				   being, and spiritual life, which is produced in the work of conversion,
				   is a far greater and more glorious effect, than mere being and life.
				   And the state from whence the change is made - a death in sin, a total
				   corruption of nature, and depth of misery - is far more remote from
				   the state attained, than mere death or non-entity.
				</p><p>
				   It is by God's power also that we are preserved in a state of grace. <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.5">1 Peter 1:5</reference>. "Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto
				   salvation." As grace is at first from God, so it is continually from
				   him, and is maintained by him, as much as light in the atmosphere is
				   all day long from the sun, as well as at first dawning, or sun-rising.
				   - Men are dependent on the power of God for every exercise of grace,
				   and for carrying on that work in the heart, for subduing sin and
				   corruption, increasing holy principles, and enabling to bring forth
				   fruit in good works. Man is dependent on divine power in bringing grace
				   to its perfection, m making the soul completely amiable in Christ's
				   glorious likeness, and filling of it with a satisfying joy and
				   blessedness; and for the raising of the body to life, and to such a
				   perfect state, that it shall be suitable for a habitation and organ for
				   a soul so perfected and blessed. These are the most glorious effects of
				   the power of God, that are seen in the series of God's acts with
				   respect to the creatures.
				</p><p>
				   Man was dependent on the power of God in his first estate, but he is
				   more dependent on his power now; he needs God's power to do more things
				   for him, and depends on a more wonderful exercise of his power. It was
				   an effect of the power of God to make man holy at the first: but more
				   remarkably so now, because there is a great deal of opposition and
				   difficulty in the way. It is a more glorious effect of power to make
				   that holy that was so depraved, and under the dominion of sin, than to
				   confer holiness on that which before had nothing of the contrary. It is
				   a more glorious work of power to rescue a soul out of the hands of the
				   devil, and from the powers of darkness, and to bring it into a state of
				   salvation, than to confer holiness where there was no prepossession or
				   opposition. <reference osisRef="Luke.11.21 Luke.11.22">Luke 11:21-22</reference>. "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace,
				   his goods are in peace; but when a stronger than he shall come upon
				   him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour, wherein he
				   trusted, and divideth his spoils." So it is a more glorious work of
				   power to uphold a soul in a state of grace and holiness, and to carry
				   it on till it is brought to glory, when there is so much sin remaining
				   in the heart resisting, and Satan with all his might opposing, than it
				   would have been to have kept man from falling at first, when Satan had
				   nothing in man.- Thus we have shown how the redeemed are dependent on
				   God for all their good, as they have all of him.
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, They are also dependent on God for all, as they have all
				   through him. God is the medium of it, as well as the author and
				   fountain of it. All we have, wisdom, the pardon of sin, deliverance
				   from hell, acceptance into God's favour, grace and holiness, true
				   comfort and happiness, eternal life and glory, is from God by a
				   Mediator; and this Mediator is God; which Mediator we have an absolute
				   dependence upon, as he through whom we receive all. So that here is
				   another way wherein we have our dependence on God for all good. God not
				   only gives us the Mediator, and accepts his mediation, and of his power
				   and grace bestows the things purchased by the Mediator; but he the
				   Mediator is God.
				</p><p>
				   Our blessings are what we have by purchase; and the purchase is made of
				   God, the blessings are purchased of him, and God gives the purchaser;
				   and not only so, but God is the purchaser. Yea God is both the
				   purchaser and the price; for Christ, who is God, purchased these
				   blessings for us, by offering up himself as the price of our salvation.
				   He purchased eternal life by the sacrifice of himself. <reference osisRef="Heb.7.27">Hebrews 7:27</reference>. "He
				   offered up himself." And 9:26. "He hath appeared to take away sin by
				   the sacrifice of himself." Indeed it was the human nature that was
				   offered; but it was the same person with the divine, and therefore was
				   an infinite price.
				</p><p>
				   As we thus have our good through God, we have a dependence on him in a
				   respect that man in his first estate had not. Man was to have eternal
				   life then through his own righteousness; so that he had partly a
				   dependence upon what was in himself; for we have a dependence upon that
				   through which we have our good, as well as that from which we have it;
				   and though man's righteousness that he then depended on was indeed from
				   God, yet it was his own, it was inherent in himself; so that his
				   dependence was not so immediately on God. But now the righteousness
				   that we are dependent on is not in ourselves, but in God. We are saved
				   through the righteousness of Christ: He is made unto us righteousness;
				   and therefore is prophesied of, <reference osisRef="Jer.23.6">Jeremiah 23:6</reference>, under that name, "the Lord
				   our righteousness." In that the righteousness we are justified by is
				   the righteousness of Christ, it is the righteousness of God. <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>. "That we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
				   -Thus in redemption we have not only all things of God, but by and
				   through him, <reference osisRef="1Cor.8.6">1 Corinthians 8:6</reference>. "But to us there is but one God, the Father,
				   of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
				   whom are all things, and we by him."
				</p><p>
				   Thirdly, The redeemed have all their good in God. We not only have it
				   of him, and through him, but it consists in him; he is all our good.-
				   The good of the redeemed is either objective or inherent. By their
				   objective good, I mean that extrinsic object, in the possession and
				   enjoyment of which they are happy. Their inherent good is that
				   excellency or pleasure which is in the soul itself. With respect to
				   both of which the redeemed have all their good in God, or which is the
				   same thing, God him- self is all their good.
				</p><p>
				   1. The redeemed have all their objective good in God. God himself is
				   the great good which they are brought to the posses- sion and enjoyment
				   of by redemption. He is the highest good, and the sum of all that good
				   which Christ purchased. God is the inheritance of the saints; he is the
				   portion of their souls. God is their wealth and treasure, their food,
				   their Life, their dwelling- place, their ornament and diadem, and their
				   everlasting honour and glory. They have none in heaven but God; he is
				   the great good which the redeemed are received to at death, and which
				   they are to rise to at the end of the world. The Lord God is the light
				   of the heavenly Jerusalem; and is the "river of the water of life "
				   that runs, and "the tree of life that grows, in the midst of the
				   paradise of God." The glorious excellencies and beauty of God will be
				   what will for ever entertain the minds of the saints, and the love of
				   God will be their everlasting feast. The redeemed will indeed enjoy
				   other things; they will enjoy the angels, and will enjoy one another;
				   but that which they shall enjoy in the angels, or each other, or in any
				   thing else whatsoever that will yield them delight and happiness, will
				   be what shall be seen of God in them.
				</p><p>
				   2. The redeemed have all their inherent good in God. Inherent good is
				   twofold; it is either excellency or pleasure. These the redeemed not
				   only derive from God, as caused by him, but have them in him. They have
				   spiritual excellency and joy by a kind of participation of God. They
				   are made excellent by a communication of God's excellency. God puts his
				   own beauty, i.e. his beautiful likeness, upon their souls. They are
				   made partakers of the divine nature, or moral image of God, <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.4">2 Peter 1:4</reference>.
				   They are holy by being made partakers of God's holiness. <reference osisRef="Heb.12.10">Hebrews 12:10</reference>.
				   The saints are beautiful and blessed by a communication of God's
				   holiness and joy, as the moon and planets are bright by the sun's
				   light. The saint hath spiritual joy and pleasure by a kind of effusion
				   of God on the soul. In these things the redeemed have communion with
				   God; that is, they partake with him and of him.
				</p><p>
				   The saints have both their spiritual excellency and blessedness by the
				   gift of the Holy Ghost, and his dwelling in them. They are not only
				   caused by the Holy Ghost, but are in him as their principle. The Holy
				   Spirit becoming an inhabitant, is a vital principle in the soul. He,
				   acting in, upon, and with the soul, becomes a fountain of true holiness
				   and joy, as a spring is of water, by the exertion and diffusion of
				   itself. <reference osisRef="John.4.14">John 4:14</reference>. "But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
				   give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him,
				   shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
				   Compared with chap. 7:38-39. "He that believeth on me, as the Scripture
				   hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water; but this
				   spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive."
				   The sum of what Christ has purchased for us, is that spring of water
				   spoken of in the former of those places, and those rivers of living
				   water spoken of in the latter. And the sum of the blessings, which the
				   redeemed shall receive in heaven, is that river of water of life that
				   proceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb, <reference osisRef="Rev.22.1">Revelation of John 22:1</reference>. Which
				   doubtless signifies the same with those rivers of living water,
				   explained, <reference osisRef="John.7.38 John.7.39">John 7:38-39</reference>, which is elsewhere called the "river of God's
				   pleasures." Herein consists the fulness of good, which the saints
				   receive of Christ. It is by partaking of the Holy Spirit, that they
				   have communion with Christ in his fulness. God hath given the Spirit,
				   not by measure unto him; and they do receive of his fulness, and grace
				   for grace. This is the sum of the saints' inheritance; and there- fore
				   that little of the Holy Ghost which believers have in this world, is
				   said to be the earnest of their inheritance, <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.22">2 Corinthians 1:22</reference>. "Who hath
				   also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
				   And chap. 5:5. "Now he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing, is
				   God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit." And <reference osisRef="Eph.1.13 Eph.1.14">Ephesians 1:13-14</reference>. "Ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the
				   earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased
				   possession."
				</p><p>
				   The Holy Spirit and good things are spoken of in Scripture as the same;
				   as if the Spirit of God communicated to the soul, comprised all good
				   things, <reference osisRef="Matt.7.11">Matthew 7:11</reference>. "How much more shall your heavenly Father give good
				   things to them that ask him?" In Luke it is, chap. 11:13. "How much
				   more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
				   him?" This is the sum of the blessings that Christ died to procure, and
				   the subject of gospel-promises. <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13 Gal.3.14">Galatians 3:13-14</reference>. "He was made a curse for
				   us, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." The
				   Spirit of God is the great promise of the Father, <reference osisRef="Luke.24.49">Luke 24:49</reference>. "Behold,
				   I send the promise of my Father upon you." The Spirit of God therefore
				   is called "the Spirit of promise," Eph. 1:33. This promised thing
				   Christ received, and had given into his hand, as soon as he had
				   finished the work of our redemption, to bestow on all that he had
				   redeemed; <reference osisRef="Acts.2.13">Acts 2:13</reference>. "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted,
				   and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he
				   hath shed forth this, which ye both see and hear." So that all the
				   holiness and happiness of the redeemed is in God. It is in the
				   communications, indwelling, and acting of the Spirit of God. Holiness
				   and happiness is in the fruit, here and hereafter, because God dwells
				   in them, and they in God.
				</p><p>
				   Thus God has given us the Redeemer, and it is by him that our good is
				   purchased. So God is the Redeemer and the price; and he also is the
				   good purchased. So that all that we have is of God, and through him,
				   and in him. <reference osisRef="Rom.11.36">Romans 11:36</reference>. "For of him, and through him, and to him, or in
				   him, are all things." The same in the Greek that is here rendered to
				   him, is rendered in him, <reference osisRef="1Cor.8.6">1 Corinthians 8:6</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   II. God is glorified in the work of redemption by this means, viz. By
				   there being so great and universal a dependence of the redeemed on him.
				</p><p>
				   1. Man hath so much the greater occasion and obligation to notice and
				   acknowledge God's perfections and all-sufficiency. The greater the
				   creature's dependence is on God's perfections, and the greater concern
				   he has with them, so much the greater occasion has he to take notice of
				   them. So much the greater concern any one has with and dependence upon
				   the power and grace of God, so much the greater occasion has he to take
				   notice of that power and grace. So much the greater and more immediate
				   dependence there is on the divine holiness, so much the greater
				   occasion to take notice of and acknowledge that. So much the greater
				   and more absolute dependence we have on the divine perfections, as
				   belonging to the several persons of the Trinity, so much the greater
				   occasion have we to observe and own the divine glory of each of them.
				   That which we are most concerned with, is surely most in the way of our
				   observation and notice; and this kind of concern with any thing, viz.
				   dependence, does especially tend to command and oblige the attention
				   and observation. Those things that we are not much dependent upon, it
				   is easy to neglect; but we can scarce do any other than mind that which
				   we have a great dependence on. By reason of our so great dependence on
				   God, and his perfections, and in so many respects, he and his glory are
				   the more directly set in our view, which way soever we turn our eyes.
				</p><p>
				   We have the greater occasion to take notice of God's all-sufficiency,
				   when all our sufficiency is thus every way of him. We have the more
				   occasion to contemplate him as an infinite good, and as the fountain of
				   all good. Such a dependence on God demonstrates his all-sufficiency. So
				   much as the dependence of the creature is on God, so much the greater
				   does the creature's emptiness in himself appear; and so much the
				   greater the creature's emptiness, so much the greater must the fulness
				   of the Being be who supplies him. Our having all of God, shows the
				   fulness of his power and grace; our having all through him, shows the
				   fulness of his merit and worthiness; and our having all in him,
				   demonstrates his fulness of beauty, love, and happiness. And the
				   redeemed, by reason of the greatness of their dependence on God, have
				   not only so much the greater occasion, but obligation to contemplate
				   and acknowledge the glory and fulness of God. How unreasonable and
				   ungrateful should we be, if we did not acknowledge that sufficiency and
				   glory which we absolutely, immediately, and universally depend upon!
				</p><p>
				   2. Hereby is demonstrated how great God's glory is considered
				   comparatively, or as compared with the creature's. By the creature
				   being thus wholly and universally dependent on God, it appears that the
				   creature is nothing, and that God is all. Hereby it appears that God is
				   infinitely above us; that God's strength, and wisdom, and holiness, are
				   infinitely greater than ours. However great and glorious the creature
				   apprehends God to be, yet if he be not sensible of the difference
				   between God and him, so as to see that God's glory is great, compared
				   with his own, he will not be disposed to give God the glory due to his
				   name. If the creature in any respects sets himself upon a level with
				   God, or exalts himself to any competition with him, however he may
				   apprehend that great honour and profound respect may belong to God from
				   those that are at a greater distance, he will not be so sensible of its
				   being due from him. So much the more men exalt themselves, so much the
				   less will they surely be disposed to exalt God. It is certainly what
				   God aims at in the disposition of things in redemption, (if we allow
				   the Scriptures to be a revelation of God's mind,) that God should
				   appear full, and man in himself empty, that God should appear all, and
				   man nothing. It is God's declared design that others should not "glory
				   in his presence;" which implies that it is his design to advance his
				   own comparative glory. So much the more man "glories in God's
				   presence," so much the less glory is ascribed to God.
				</p><p>
				   3. By its being thus ordered, that the creature should have so absolute
				   and universal a dependence on God, provision is made that God should
				   have our whole souls, and should be the object of our undivided
				   respect. If we had our dependence partly on God, and partly on
				   something else, man's respect would be divided to those different
				   things on which he had dependence. Thus it would be if we depended on
				   God only for a part of our good, and on ourselves, or some other being,
				   for another part: or if we had our good only from God, and through
				   another that was not God, and in something else distinct from both, our
				   hearts would be divided between the good itself, and him from whom, and
				   him through whom, we received it. But now there is no occasion for
				   this, God being not only he from or of whom we have all good, but also
				   through whom, and is that good itself, that we have from him and
				   through him. So that whatsoever there is to attract our respect, the
				   tendency is still directly towards God; all unites in him as the
				   centre.
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">USE.</hi>
				</p><p>
				   1. We may here observe the marvellous wisdom of God, in the work of
				   redemption. God hath made man's emptiness and misery, his low, lost,
				   and ruined state, into which he sunk by the fall, an occasion of the
				   greater advancement of his own glory, as in other ways, so particularly
				   in this, that there is now much more universal and apparent dependence
				   of man on God. Though God be pleased to lift man out of that dismal
				   abyss of sin and woe into which he was fallen, and exceedingly to exalt
				   him in excellency and honour, and to a high pitch of glory and
				   blessedness, yet the creature hath nothing in any respect to glory of;
				   all the glory evidently belongs to God, all is in a mere, and most
				   absolute, and divine dependence on the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And
				   each person of the Trinity is equally glorified in this work: there is
				   an absolute dependence of the creature on every one for all: all is of
				   the Father, all through the Son, and all in the Holy Ghost. Thus God
				   appears in the work of redemption as all in all. It is fit that he who
				   is, and there is none else, should be the Alpha and Omega, the first
				   and the last, the all and the only, in this work.
				</p><p>
				   2. Hence those doctrines and schemes of divinity that are in any
				   respect opposite to such an absolute and universal dependence on God,
				   derogate from his glory, and thwart the design of our redemption. And
				   such are those schemes that put the creature in God's stead, in any of
				   the mentioned respects, that exalt man into the place of either Father,
				   Son, or Holy Ghost, in any thing pertaining to our redemption. However
				   they may allow of a dependence of the redeemed on God, yet they deny a
				   dependence that is so absolute and universal. They own an entire
				   dependence of God for some things, but not for others; they own that we
				   depend on God for the gift and acceptance of a Redeemer, but deny so
				   absolute a dependence on him for the obtaining of an interest in the
				   Redeemer. They own an absolute dependence on the Father for giving his
				   Son, and on the Son for working out redemption, but not so entire a
				   dependence on the Holy Ghost for conversion, and a being in Christ, and
				   so coming to a title to his benefits. They own a dependence on God for
				   means of grace, but not absolutely for the benefit and success of those
				   means; a partial dependence on the power of God, for obtaining and
				   exercising holiness, but not a mere dependence on the arbitrary and
				   sovereign grace of God. They own a dependence on the free grace of God
				   for a reception into his favour, so far that it is without any proper
				   merit, but not as it is without being attracted, or moved with any
				   excellency. They own a partial dependence on Christ, as he through whom
				   we have life, as having purchased new terms of life, but still hold
				   that the righteousness through which we have life is inherent in
				   ourselves, as it was under the first covenant. Now whatever scheme is
				   inconsistent with our entire dependence on God for all, and of having
				   all of him, through him, and in him, it is repugnant to the design and
				   tenor of the gospel, and robs it of that which God accounts its lustre
				   and glory.
				</p><p>
				   3. Hence we may learn a reason why faith is that by which we come to
				   have an interest in this redemption; for there is included in the
				   nature of faith, a sensible acknowledgment of absolute dependence on
				   God in this affair. It is very fit that it should be required of all,
				   in order to their having the benefit of this redemption, that they
				   should be sensible of, and acknowledge, their dependence on God for it.
				   It is by this means that God hath contrived to glorify himself in
				   redemption; and it is fit that he should at least have this glory of
				   those that are the subjects of this redemption, and have the benefit of
				   it.- Faith is a sensibleness of what is real in the work of
				   redemption; and the soul that believes doth entirely depend on God for
				   all salvation, in its own sense and act. Faith abases men, and exalts
				   God; it gives all the glory of redemption to him alone. It is necessary
				   in order to saving faith, that man should be emptied of himself, be
				   sensible that he is "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
				   naked." Humility is a great ingredient of true faith: he that truly
				   receives redemption, receives it as a little child, <reference osisRef="Mark.10.15">Mark 10:15</reference>.
				   "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of heaven as a little child,
				   he shall not enter therein." It is the delight of a believing soul to
				   abase itself and exalt God alone: that is the language of it, <reference osisRef="Ps.115.1">Psalms 115:1</reference>. "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give glory."
				</p><p>
				   4. Let us be exhorted to exalt God alone, and ascribe to him all the
				   glory of redemption. Let us endeavour to obtain, and increase in, a
				   sensibleness of our great dependence on God, to have our eye to him
				   alone, to mortify a self-dependent and self-righteous disposition. Man
				   is naturally exceeding prone to exalt himself, and depend on his own
				   power or goodness; as though from himself he must expect happiness. He
				   is prone to have respect to enjoyments alien from God and his Spirit,
				   as those in which happiness is to be found.- But this doctrine should
				   teach us to exalt God alone; as by trust and reliance, so by praise.
				   Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord. Hath any man hope that he is
				   converted, and sanctified, and that his mind is endowed with true
				   excellency and spiritual beauty? that his sins are forgiven, and he
				   received into God's favour, and exalted to the honour and blessedness
				   of being his child, and an heir of eternal life? let him give God all
				   the glory; who alone makes him to differ from the worst of men in this
				   world, or the most miserable of the damned in hell. Hath any man much
				   comfort and strong hope of eternal life, let not his hope lift him up,
				   but dispose him the more to abase himself, to reflect on his own
				   exceeding unworthiness of such a favour,and to exalt God alone. Is any
				   man eminent in holiness, and abundant in good works, let him take
				   nothing of the glory of it to himself, but ascribe it to him whose
				   "workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus unto good works."

				<title>TRUE SAINTS, WHEN ABSENT FROM THE BODY, ARE PRESENT WITH THE LORD</title>
				<p>
					Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
				   <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.8">2 Corinthians 5:8</reference> - We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be
				   absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
				</p><p>
				   THE apostle in this place is giving a reason why he went on with so
				   much boldness and immovable steadfastness, through such labors,
				   sufferings, and dangers of his life, in the service of his Lord; for
				   which his enemies, the false teachers among the Corinthians, sometimes
				   reproached him as being beside himself, and driven on by a kind of
				   madness. In the latter part of the preceding chapter, the apostle
				   informs the Christian Corinthians, that the reason why he did thus,
				   was, that he firmly believed the promises that Christ had made to his
				   faithful servants of a glorious future eternal reward, and knew that
				   these present afflictions were light, and but for a moment, in
				   comparison of that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The
				   same discourse is continued in this chapter; wherein the apostle
				   further insists on the reason he had given of his constancy in
				   suffering, and exposing himself to death in the work of the ministry,
				   even the more happy state he expected after death. And this is the
				   subject of the text; wherein may be observed,
				</p><p>
				    1. The great future privilege, which the apostle hoped for; that of
				       being present with Christ. The words, in the original, properly
				       signify dwelling with Christ, as in the same country or city, or
				       making a home with Christ.
				</p><p>
				    2. When the apostle looked for this privilege, viz., when he should be
				       absent from the body. Not to wait for it till the resurrection,
				       when soul and body should be united again. He signifies the same
				       thing in his epistle to the Philippians, chap. i. 22, 23: "But if I
				       live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor. Yet what I shall
				       choose, I wot not. For I am in a strait between two; having a
				       desire to depart, and to be with Christ."
				</p><p>
				    3. The value the apostle set on this privilege. It was such, that for
				       the sake of it, he chose to be absent from the body. He was willing
				       rather, or (as the word properly signifies) it were more pleasing
				       to him, to part with the present life, and all its enjoyments, and
				       be possessed of this great benefit, than to continue here.
				</p><p>
				    4. The present benefit, which the apostle had by his faith and hope of
				       this future privilege, and of his great value for it, viz., that
				       hence he received courage, assurance, and constancy of mind,
				       agreeable to the proper import of the word that is rendered, we are
				       confident. The apostle is now giving a reason of that fortitude and
				       immovable stability of mind, with which he went through those
				       extreme labors, hardships and dangers, which he mentions in this
				       discourse; so that, in the midst of all, he did not faint, was not
				       discouraged, but had constant light, and inward support, strength,
				       and comfort in the midst of all: agreeable to the 10th verse of the
				       foregoing chapter, "For which cause, we faint not; but though our
				       outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." And
				       the same is expressed more particularly in the 8th, 9th, and 10th
				       verses, of that chapter: "We are troubled on every side, yet not
				       distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but
				       not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in
				       the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
				       might be made manifest in our mortal flesh." And in the next
				       chapter, verses 4- 10: "In all things approving ourselves as the
				       ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities,
				       in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors,
				       in watchings, in fastings, by pureness, by knowledge, by
				       long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
				       by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of
				       righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and
				       dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet
				       true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we
				       live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway
				       rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and
				       yet possessing all things."
				</p><p>
				   Among the many useful observations there might be raised from the text,
				   I shall at this time only insist on that which lies most plainly before
				   us in the words, viz., this:
				</p><p>
				   The souls of true saints, when they leave their bodies at death, go to
				   be with Christ.
				</p><p>
				   Departed souls of saints go to be with Christ, in the following
				   respects:
				</p><p>
				    1. They go to dwell in the same blessed abode with the glorified human
				       nature of Christ.
				       The human nature of Christ is yet in being. He still continues, and
				       will continue to all eternity, to be both God and man. His whole
				       human nature remains: not only his human soul, but also his human
				       body. His dead body rose from the dead; and the same that was
				       raised from the dead, is exalted and glorified at God's right hand;
				       that which was dead is now alive, and lives for evermore.
				       And therefore there is a certain place, a particular part of the
				       external creation, to which Christ is gone, and where he remains.
				       And this place is that which we call the highest heaven, or the
				       heaven of heavens; a place beyond all the visible heavens. Eph. iv.
				       9, 10, "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
				       first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended, is the
				       same also that ascended up far above all heavens." This is the same
				       which the apostle calls the third heaven, 2 Cor. xii. 2, reckoning
				       the aerial heaven as the first, the starry heaven as the second,
				       and the highest heaven as the third. This is the abode of the holy
				       angels; they are called "the angels of heaven," Matt. xxiv. 36;
				       "The angels which are in heaven," Mark xiii. 32; "The angels of God
				       in heaven," Matt. xxii. 30, and Mark xii. 25. They are said "always
				       to behold the face of the Father which is in heaven," Matt. xviii,
				       10. And they are elsewhere often represented as before the throne
				       of God, or surrounding his throne in heaven, and sent from thence,
				       and descending from thence on messages to this world. And thither
				       it is that the souls of departed saints are conducted, when they
				       die. They are not reserved in some abode distinct from the highest
				       heaven; a place of rest, which they are kept in, till the day of
				       judgment; such as some imagine, which they call the hades of the
				       happy: but they go directly to heaven itself. This is the saints'
				       home, being their Father's house: they are pilgrims and strangers
				       on the earth, and this is the other and better country that they
				       are travelling to, Heb. xi. 13?26. This is the city they belong to:
				       Philip. iii. 20, "Our conversation or (as the word properly
				       signifies) citizenship, is in heaven." Therefore this undoubtedly
				       is the place the apostle has respect to in my text, when he
				       says,"We are willing to forsake our former house, the body, and to
				       dwell in the same house, city or country, wherein Christ dwells;"
				       which is the proper import of the words of the original. What can
				       this house, or city, or country be, but that house, which is
				       elsewhere spoken of, as their proper home, and their Father's
				       house, and the city and country to which they properly belong, and
				       whither they are travelling all the while they continue in this
				       world, and the house, city, and country where we know the human
				       nature of Christ is? This is the saints' rest; here their hearts
				       are while they live; and here their treasure is. "The inheritance
				       incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, that is
				       designed for them, is reserved in heaven," 1 Pet. i. 4; and
				       therefore they never can have their proper and full rest till they
				       come here. So that undoubtedly their souls, when absent from their
				       bodies (when the Scriptures represent them as in a state of perfect
				       rest), arrive hither. Those two saints, that left this world, to go
				       to their rest in another world, without dying, viz., Enoch and
				       Elijah, went to heaven. Elijah was seen ascending up to heaven, as
				       Christ was. And to the same resting place, is there all reason to
				       think, that those saints go, that leave the world, to go to their
				       rest, by death. Moses, when he died in the top of the mount,
				       ascended to the same glorious abode with Elias, who ascended
				       without dying. They are companions in another world; as they
				       appeared together at Christ's transfiguration. They were together
				       at that time with Christ in the mount, when there was a specimen or
				       sample of his glorification in heaven. And doubtless they were also
				       together afterwards, with him, when he was, actually, fully
				       glorified in heaven. And thither undoubtedly it was, that the soul
				       of Stephen ascended, when he expired. The circumstances of his
				       death demonstrate it, as we have an account of it, Acts vii. 55,
				       etc.: "He, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into
				       heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right
				       hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the
				       Son of man (i.e. Jesus, in his human nature) standing on the right
				       hand of God. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped
				       their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of
				       the city, and stoned him. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon
				       God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." Before his death
				       he had an extraordinary view of the glory that his Saviour had
				       received in heaven, not only for himself, but for him, and all his
				       faithful followers; that he might be encouraged, by the hopes of
				       this glory, cheerfully to lay down his life for his sake.
				       Accordingly he dies in the hope of this, saying, "Lord Jesus,
				       receive my spirit." By which doubtless he meant, "receive my spirit
				       to be with thee, in that glory, wherein I have now seen thee, in
				       heaven, at the right hand of God." And thither it was that the soul
				       of the penitent thief on the cross ascended. Christ said to him,
				       "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise." Paradise is the same
				       with the third heaven; as appears by 2 Cor. xii. 2, 3, 4. There
				       that which is called the third heaven in the 2d verse, in the 4th
				       verse is called paradise. The departed souls of the apostles and
				       prophets are in heaven; as is manifest from Rev. xviii. 20:
				       "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets."
				       The church of God is distinguished in Scripture, from time to time,
				       into these two parts; that part of it that is in heaven, and that
				       which is in earth; Eph. iii. 14, 15, "Jesus Christ, of whom the
				       whole family in heaven and earth is named." Col. i. 20, "And having
				       made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all
				       things to himself, by him, I say, whether they be things in earth
				       or things in heaven." Now what things in heaven are they for whom
				       peace has been made by the blood of Christ's cross, and who have by
				       him been reconciled to God, but the saints in heaven? In like
				       manner we read, Eph. i. 10, of God's gathering together in one all
				       things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth,
				       even in him." The spirits of just men made perfect are in the same
				       city of the living God, and heavenly Jerusalem, with the
				       innumerable company of angels, and Jesus the Mediator of the new
				       covenant; as is manifest by Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24. The church of God
				       is often in Scripture called by the name Jerusalem; and the apostle
				       speaks of the Jerusalem which is above, or which is in heaven, as
				       the mother of us all; but if no part of the church be in heaven, or
				       none but Enoch and Elias, it is not likely that the church would be
				       called the Jerusalem which is in heaven.

				    2. The souls of true saints, when they leave their bodies at death, go
				       to be with Christ, as they go to dwell in the immediate, full and
				       constant sight or view of him.
				       When we are absent from our dear friends, they are out of sight;
				       but when we are with them, we have the opportunity and satisfaction
				       of seeing them. So while the saints are in the body, and are absent
				       from the Lord, HE is in several respects out of sight: 1 Pet. i. 8,
				       "Whom having not seen, ye love: in whom, though now ye see him not,
				       yet believing," etc. They have indeed, in this world, a spiritual
				       sight of Christ; but they see through a glass darkly, and with
				       great interruption; but in heaven they see him face to face, 1 Cor.
				       xiii. 12; "The pure in heart are blessed; for they shall see God,"
				       Matt. v. 8. Their beatifical vision of God is in Christ, who is
				       that brightness or effulgence of God's glory, by which his glory
				       shines forth in heaven, to the view of saints and angels there, as
				       well as here on earth. This is the Sun of righteousness, that is
				       not only the light of this world, but is also the sun that
				       enlightens the heavenly Jerusalem; by whose bright beams it is that
				       the glory of God shines forth there, to the enlightening and making
				       happy all the glorious inhabitants. "The Lamb is the light thereof;
				       and so the glory of God doth lighten it," Rev. xxi. 23. None sees
				       God the Father immediately, who is the King eternal, immortal,
				       invisible; Christ is the image of that invisible God, by which he
				       is seen by all elect creatures. The only begotten Son that is in
				       the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him, and manifested him.
				       None has ever immediately seen the Father, but the Son; and none
				       else sees the Father any other way, than by the Son's revealing
				       him. And in heaven, the spirits of just men made perfect do see him
				       as he is. They behold his glory. They see the glory of his divine
				       nature, consisting in all the glory of the Godhead, the beauty of
				       all his perfections; his great majesty, almighty power, his
				       infinite wisdom, holiness, and grace, and they see the beauty of
				       his glorified human nature, and the glory which the Father hath
				       given him, as God-man and Mediator. For this end, Christ desired
				       that his saints might "be with him, that they might behold his
				       glory," John xvii. 24. And when the souls of the saints leave their
				       bodies, to go to be with Christ, they behold the marvellous glory
				       of that great work of his, the work of redemption, and of the
				       glorious way of salvation by him; desire to look into. They have a
				       most clear view of the unfathomable depths of the manifold wisdom
				       and knowledge of God; and the most bright displays of the infinite
				       purity and holiness of God, that do appear in that way and work;
				       and see in a much clearer manner than the saints do here, what is
				       the breadth and length, and depth and height of the grace and love
				       of Christ, appearing in his redemption. And as they see the
				       unspeakable riches and glory of the attribute of God's grace, so
				       they most clearly behold and understand Christ's eternal and
				       unmeasurable dying love to them in particular. And in short, they
				       see every thing in Christ that tends to kindle and inflame love,
				       and every thing that tends to gratify love, and every thing that
				       tends to satisfy them: and that in the most clear and glorious
				       manner, without any darkness or delusion, without any impediment or
				       interruption. Now the saints, while in the body, see something of
				       Christ's glory and love; as we, in the dawning of the morning, see
				       something of the reflected light of the sun mingled with darkness;
				       but when separated from the body, they see their glorious and
				       loving Redeemer, as we see the sun when risen, and showing his
				       whole disk above the horizon, by his direct beams, in a clear
				       hemisphere, and with perfect day.
				</p><p>
				    3. The souls of true saints, when absent from the body go to be with
				       Jesus Christ, as they are brought into a most perfect conformity to
				       and union with him. Their spiritual conformity is begun while they
				       are in the hotly; here beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the
				       Lord, they are changed into the same image; but when they come to
				       see him as he is, in heaven, then they become like him in another
				       manner. That perfect sight will abolish all remains of deformity,
				       disagreement, and sinful unlikeness; as all darkness is abolished
				       before the full blaze of the sun's meridian light: it is impossible
				       that the least degree of obscurity should remain before such light;
				       so it is impossible the least degree of sin and spiritual deformity
				       should remain, in such a view of the spiritual beauty and glory of
				       Christ, as the saints enjoy in heaven; when they see that Sun of
				       righteousness without a cloud, they themselves shine forth as the
				       sun, and shall be as little suns, without a spot. For then is come
				       the time when Christ presents his saints to himself, in glorious
				       beauty; "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;" and
				       having holiness without a blemish. And then the saints' union with
				       Christ is perfected. This also is begun in this world. The relative
				       union is both begun and perfected at once, when the soul first
				       closes with Christ by faith: the real union, consisting in the
				       union of hearts and affections, and in the vital union, is begun in
				       this world and perfected in the next. The union of the heart of a
				       believer to Christ, is begun when his heart is drawn to Christ, by
				       the first discovery of divine excellency, at conversion; and
				       consequent on this drawing and closing of his heart with Christ, is
				       established a vital union with Christ; whereby the believer becomes
				       a living branch of the true vine, living by a communication of the
				       sap and vital juice of the stock and root; and a member of Christ's
				       mystical body, living by a communication of spiritual and vital
				       influences from the head, and by a kind of participation of
				       Christ's own life. But while the saints are in the body, there is
				       much remaining distance between Christ and them: there are
				       remainders of alienation, and the vital union is very imperfect;
				       and so consequently is the communication of spiritual life and
				       vital influences: there is much between Christ and believers to
				       keep them asunder, much indwelling sin, much temptation, a world of
				       carnal objects, to keep off the soul from Christ, and hinder a
				       perfect coalescence.
				       But when the soul leaves the body, all these clogs and hinderances
				       shall be removed, every separating wall shall be broken down, and
				       every impediment taken out of the way, and all distance shall
				       cease; the heart shall be wholly and forever attached and bound to
				       him, by a perfect view of his glory. And the vital union shall then
				       be brought to perfection; the soul shall live perfectly in and upon
				       Christ, being perfectly filled with his spirit, and animated by his
				       vital influences; living, as it were, only by Christ's life,
				       without any remainder of spiritual death, or carnal life.
				</p><p>
				    4. Departed souls of saints are with Christ, as they enjoy a glorious
				       and immediate intercourse and converse with him.
				       While we are present with our friends, we have opportunity for that
				       free and immediate conversation with them, which we cannot have in
				       absence from them. And therefore, by reason of the vastly more
				       free, perfect, and immediate intercourse with Christ, which the
				       saints enjoy when absent from the body, they are fitly represented
				       as present with him.
				       The most intimate intercourse becomes that relation that the saints
				       stand in to Jesus Christ; and especially becomes that most perfect
				       and glorious union they shall be brought into with him in heaven.
				       They are not merely Christ's servants, but his friends, John xv.
				       15. His brethren and companions, Psalm cxxii. 8; "yea, they are the
				       spouse of Christ." They are espoused or betrothed to Christ while
				       in the body; but when they go to heaven, they enter into the king's
				       palace, their marriage with him is come, and the king brings them
				       into his chambers indeed. They then go to dwell with Christ
				       constantly, to enjoy the most perfect converse with him. Christ
				       conversed in the most friendly manner with his disciples on earth;
				       he admitted one of them to lean on his bosom: but they are admitted
				       much more fully and freely to converse with him in heaven. Though
				       Christ be there in a state of glorious exaltation, reigning in the
				       majesty and glory of the sovereign Lord and God of heaven and
				       earth, angels and men; yet this will not hinder intimacy and
				       freedom of intercourse, but rather promote it. For he is thus
				       exalted, not only for himself, but for them; he is instated in this
				       glory of head over all things for their sakes, that they might be
				       exalted and glorified; and when they go to heaven where he is, they
				       are exalted and glorified with him; and shall not be kept at a more
				       awful distance from Christ, but shall be admitted nearer, and to a
				       greater intimacy. For they shall be unspeakably more fit for it,
				       and Christ in more fit circumstances to bestow on them this
				       blessedness. Their seeing the great glory of their friend and
				       Redeemer, will not awe them to a distance, and make them afraid of
				       a near approach; but on the contrary, will most powerfully draw
				       them near, and encourage and engage them to holy freedom. For they
				       will know that it is he that is their own Redeemer, and beloved
				       friend and bridegroom; the very same that loved them with a dying
				       love, and redeemed them to God by his blood; Matt. xiv. 27, "It is
				       I; be not afraid." Rev. i. 17, 18," Fear not:-I am he that liveth,
				       and was dead." And the nature of this glory of Christ that they
				       shall see, will be such as will draw and encourage them; for they
				       will not only see infinite majesty and greatness, but infinite
				       grace, condescension, and mildness, and gentleness and sweetness,
				       equal to his majesty. For he appears in heaven, not only as "the
				       Lion of the tribe of Judah, but as the Lamb, and the Lamb in the
				       midst of the throne, "Rev. v. 5, 6; and this Lamb in the midst of
				       the throne shall be their shepherd, to" feed them, and lead them to
				       living fountains of water," Rev. vii. 17; so that the sight of
				       Christ's great kingly majesty will be no terror to them; but will
				       only serve the more to heighten their pleasure and surprise. When
				       Mary was about to embrace Christ, being full of joy at the sight of
				       him again alive after his crucifixion, Christ forbids her to do it
				       for the ended: John xx. 16, 17, "Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She
				       turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni, which is to say,
				       Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet
				       ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I
				       ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God and your
				       God." As if he had said, "This is not the time and place for that
				       freedom your love to me desires: this is appointed in heaven after
				       my ascension. I am going thither; and you that are my true
				       disciples, shall, as my brethren and companions, soon be there with
				       me in my glory. And then there shall be no restraint. That is the
				       place appointed for the most perfect expressions of complacence and
				       endearment, and full enjoyment of mutual love." And accordingly the
				       souls of departed saints with Christ in heaven, shall have Christ
				       as it were unbosomed unto them, manifesting those infinite riches
				       of love towards them, that have been there from eternity; and they
				       shall be enabled to express their love to him, in an infinitely
				       better manner than ever they could while in the body. Thus they
				       shall eat and drink abundantly, and swim in the ocean of love, and
				       be eternally swallowed up in the infinitely bright, and infinitely
				       mild and sweet beams of divine love; eternally receiving that
				       light, eternally full of it, and eternally compassed round with it,
				       and everlastingly reflecting it back again to the fountain of it.
				</p><p>
				    5. The souls of the saints, when they leave their bodies at death, go
				       to be with Christ, as they are received to a glorious fellowship
				       with Christ in his blessedness.
				       As the wife is received to a joint possession of her husband's
				       estate, and as the wife of a prince partakes with him in his
				       princely possessions and honors; so the church, the spouse of
				       Christ, when the marriage comes, and she is received to dwell with
				       him in heaven, shall partake with him in his glory. When Christ
				       rose from the dead, and took possession of eternal life; this was
				       not as a private person, but as the public head of all his redeemed
				       people. He took possession of it for them, as well as for himself;
				       and "they are quickened together with him, and raised up together."
				       And so when he ascended into heaven, and was exalted to great glory
				       there, this also was as a public person. He took possession of
				       heaven, not only for himself, but his people, as their forerunner
				       and head, that they might ascend also, "and sit together in
				       heavenly places with him," Eph. ii. 5, 6. "Christ writes upon them
				       his new name," Rev. iii. 12; i.e., he makes them partakers of his
				       own glory and exaltation in heaven. His new name is that new honor
				       and glory that the Father invested him with, when he set him on his
				       own right hand. As a prince, when he advances any one to new
				       dignity in his kingdom, gives him a new title. Christ and his
				       saints shall be glorified together, Rom. viii. 17.
				       The saints in heaven have communion, or a joint participation with
				       Christ in his glory and blessedness in heaven, in the following
				       respects more especially.
				</p><p>
				    1. They partake with him in the ineffable delights he has in heaven,
				       in the enjoyment of his Father.
				       When Christ ascended into heaven, he was received to a glorious and
				       peculiar joy and blessedness in the enjoyment of his Father, who,
				       in his passion, hid his face from him; such an enjoyment as became
				       the relation he stood in to the Father, and such as was a meet
				       reward for the great and hard service he had performed on earth.
				       Then "God showed him the path of life, and brought him into his
				       presence, where is fulness of joy, and to sit on his right hand,
				       where there are pleasures for evermore," as is said of Christ,
				       Psalm xvi. 11. Then the Father "made him most blessed forever. He
				       made him exceeding glad with his countenance;" as in Psalm xxi. 6.
				       The saints, by virtue of their union with Christ, and being his
				       members, do, in some sort partake of his childlike relation to the
				       Father; and so are heirs with him of his happiness in the enjoyment
				       of his Father; as seems to be intimated by the apostle, in Gal. iv.
				       4-7. The spouse of Christ, by virtue of her espousals to that only
				       begotten Son of God, is, as it were, a partaker of his filial
				       relation to God, and becomes the king's daughter, Psalm xiv. 13,
				       and so partakes with her divine husband in his enjoyment of his
				       Father and her Father, his God and her God." A promise of this
				       seems to be implied in those words of Christ to Mary, John xx. 17.
				       Thus Christ's faithful servants "enter into the joy of their Lord,"
				       Matt. xxv. 21, 23, and "Christ's joy remains in them;" agreeably to
				       those words of Christ, John xv. 11. Christ from eternity is, as it
				       were, in the bosom of the Father, as the object of his infinite
				       complacence. In him is the Father's eternal happiness. Before the
				       world was, he was with the Father, in the enjoyment of his infinite
				       love; and had infinite delight and blessedness in that enjoyment;
				       as he declares of himself in Prov. viii. 30: "Then I was by him as
				       one brought up with him. And I was daily his delight, rejoicing
				       always before him." And when Christ ascended to the Father after
				       his passion, he went to him, to the enjoyment of the same glory and
				       blessedness in the enjoyment of his love; agreeably to his prayer
				       the evening before his crucifixion, John xvii. 5: "And now, O
				       Father, glorify me with thine own self, with the glory I had with
				       thee before the world was." And in the same prayer, he manifests it
				       to be his will, that his true disciples should be with him in the
				       enjoyment of that joy and glory, which he then asked for himself,
				       verse 13: "That my joy might be fulfilled in themselves:" verse 22,
				       "And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them." This glory
				       of Christ, which the saints are to enjoy with him, is that which he
				       has in the enjoyment of the Father's infinite love to him; as
				       appears by the last words of that prayer of our Lord, verse 26:
				       "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I
				       in them." The love which the Father has to his Son is great indeed:
				       the Deity does, as it were, wholly and entirely flow out in a
				       stream of love to Christ; and the joy and pleasure of Christ is
				       proportionably great. This is the stream of Christ's delights, the
				       river of his infinite pleasure; which he will make his saints to
				       drink of with him, agreeably to Psal. xxxvi. 8, 9: "They shall be
				       abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house. Thou shalt make
				       them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the
				       fountain of life. In thy light shall we see light." The saints
				       shall have pleasure in partaking with Christ in his pleasure, and
				       shall see light in his light. They shall partake with Christ of the
				       same river of pleasure, shall drink of the same water of life, and
				       of the same new wine in Christ's Father's kingdom, Matt. xxvi. 29.
				       That new wine is especially that joy and happiness that Christ and
				       his true disciples shall partake of together in glory, which is the
				       purchase of Christ's blood, or the reward of his obedience unto
				       death. Christ, at his ascension into heaven, received everlasting
				       pleasures at his Father's right hand, and in the enjoyment of his
				       Father's love, as the reward of his own death, or obedience unto
				       death. But the same righteousness is reckoned to both head and
				       members; and both shall have fellowship in the same reward, each
				       according to their distinct capacity.
				       That the saints in heaven have such a communion with Christ in his
				       joy, and do so partake with him in his own enjoyment of the Father,
				       does greatly manifest the transcendent excellency of their
				       happiness, and their being admitted to a vastly higher privilege in
				       glory than the angels.
				</p><p>
				    2. The saints in heaven are received to a fellowship or participation
				       with Christ in the glory of that dominion to which the Father hath
				       exalted him.
				</p><p>
				       The saints, when they ascend to heaven as Christ ascended, and are
				       made to sit together with him in heavenly places, and are partakers
				       of the glory of his exaltation, are exalted to reign with him. They
				       are through him made kings and priests, and reign with him, and in
				       him, over the same kingdom. As the Father hath appointed unto him a
				       kingdom, so he has appointed to them. The Father has appointed the
				       Son to reign over his own kingdom, and the Son appoints his saints
				       to reign in his. The Father has given to Christ to sit with him on
				       his throne, and Christ gives to the saints to sit with him on his
				       throne, agreeably to Christ's promise, Rev. iii. 21. Christ, as
				       God's Son, is the heir of his kingdom, and the saints are joint
				       heirs with Christ: which implies, that they are heirs of the same
				       inheritance, to possess the same kingdom, in and with him,
				       according to their capacity. Christ, in his kingdom, reigns over
				       heaven and earth; he is appointed the heir of all things; and so
				       all things are the saints'; "whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas,
				       or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to
				       come," all are theirs; because they are Christ's, and united to
				       him, 1 Cor. iii. 21, 22, 23. The angels are given to Christ as a
				       part of his dominion: they are all given to wait upon him as
				       ministering spirits to him. So also they are all, even the highest
				       and most dignified of them, ministering spirits, to minister to
				       them who are the heirs of salvation. They are Christ's angels, and
				       they are also their angels. Such is the saints' union with Christ,
				       and their interest in him, that what he possesses, they possess, in
				       a much more perfect and blessed manner than if all things were
				       given to them separately, and by themselves, to be disposed of
				       according to their discretion. They are now disposed of so as, in
				       every respect, to be most for their blessedness, by an infinitely
				       better discretion than their own; and in being disposed of by their
				       head and husband, between whom and them there is the most perfect
				       union of hearts, and so the most perfect union of wills, and who
				       are most perfectly each other's.
				</p><p>
				       As the glorified spouse of this great King reigns with and in him,
				       in his dominion over the universe, so more especially does she
				       partake with him in the joy and glory of his reign in his kingdom
				       of grace; which is more peculiarly the kingdom that he possesses as
				       Head of the church, and is that kingdom wherein she is more
				       especially interested. It was especially to reign in this kingdom,
				       that God the Father exalted him to his throne in heaven: he set his
				       King on his holy hill of Zion, especially that he might reign over
				       Zion, or over his church, in his kingdom of grace; and that he
				       might be under the best advantages to carry on the designs of his
				       love in this lower world. And therefore undoubtedly the saints in
				       heaven are partakers with Christ in the joy and glory of the
				       advancement and prosperity of his kingdom of grace on earth, and
				       success of his gospel here, which he looks on as the peculiar glory
				       of his reign.

				       The good shepherd rejoices when he finds but one sheep that was
				       lost; and his friends and neighbors in heaven rejoice with him on
				       that occasion. That part of the family that is in heaven is surely
				       not unacquainted with the affairs of that part of the same family
				       that is on earth. They that are with the King and are next to him,
				       the royal family, that dwell in his palace, are not kept in
				       ignorance of the affairs of his kingdom. The saints in heaven are
				       with the angels, the King's ministers, by which he manages the
				       affairs of his kingdom, and who are continually ascending and
				       descending from heaven to the earth, and one or other of them daily
				       employed as ministering spirits to each individual member of the
				       church below: besides the continual ascending of the souls of
				       departed saints from all parts of the militant church. On these
				       accounts the saints in heaven must needs be under a thousand times
				       greater advantage than we here for a full view of the state of the
				       church on earth, and a speedy, direct, and certain acquaintance
				       with all its affairs in every part. And that which gives them much
				       greater advantage for such an acquaintance than the things already
				       mentioned, is their being constantly in the immediate presence of
				       Christ, and in the enjoyment of the most perfect intercourse with
				       him, who is the King who manages all these affairs, and has an
				       absolutely perfect knowledge of them. Christ is the head of the
				       whole glorified assembly; they are mystically his glorified body:
				       and what the head sees, it sees for the information of the whole
				       body, according to its capacity: and what the head enjoys, is for
				       the joy of the whole body.
				</p><p>
				       The saints, in leaving this world, and ascending to heaven, do not
				       go out of sight of things appertaining to Christ's kingdom on
				       earth; but, on the contrary, they go out of a state of obscurity,
				       and ascend above the mists and clouds into the clearest light: to a
				       pinnacle in the very centre of light, where every thing appears in
				       clear view. They have as much greater advantage to view the state
				       of Christ's kingdom, and the works of the new creation here, than
				       while they were in this world, as a man that ascends to the top of
				       a high mountain has a greater advantage to view the face of the
				       earth, than he had while he was in a deep valley, or thick forest
				       below, surrounded on every side with those things that impeded and
				       limited his sight. Nor do they view as indifferent or unconcerned
				       spectators, any more than Christ himself is an unconcerned
				       spectator.
				</p><p>
				       The happiness of the saints in heaven consists very much in
				       beholding the glory of God appearing in the work of redemption: for
				       it is by this chiefly that God manifests his glory, the glory of
				       his wisdom, holiness, grace, and other perfections, to both saints
				       and angels; as is apparent by many Scriptures. And therefore
				       undoubtedly their happiness consists very much in beholding the
				       progress of this work in its application and success, and the steps
				       by which infinite power and wisdom bring it to its consummation.
				       And the saints in heaven are under unspeakably greater advantage to
				       take the pleasure of beholding the progress of this work on earth
				       than we are that are here; as they are under greater advantages to
				       see and understand the marvellous steps that Divine Wisdom takes in
				       all that is done, and the glorious ends he obtains, the opposition
				       Satan makes, and how he is baffled and overthrown. They can better
				       see the connection of one event with another, and the beautiful
				       order of all things that come to pass in the church in different
				       ages that to us appear like confusion. Nor do they only view these
				       things, and rejoice in them, as a glorious and beautiful sight, but
				       as persons interested, as Christ is interested; as possessing these
				       things in Christ, and reigning with him, in this kingdom. Christ's
				       success in his work of redemption, in bringing home souls to
				       himself, applying his saving benefits by his Spirit, and the
				       advancement of the kingdom of grace in the world, is the reward
				       especially promised to him by his Father in the covenant of
				       redemption, for the hard and difficult service he performed while
				       in the form of a servant; as is manifest by Isai. liii. 10, 11, 12.
				       But the saints shall be rewarded with him: they shall partake with
				       him in the joy of this reward; for this obedience that is thus
				       rewarded is reckoned to them as they are his members, as was before
				       observed. This was especially the joy that was set before Christ,
				       for the sake of which he endured the cross and despised the shame.
				       And his joy is the joy of all heaven. They that are with him in
				       heaven are under much the greatest advantages to partake with him
				       in this joy; for they have a perfect communion with him through
				       whom, and in fellowship with whom, they enjoy and possess their
				       whole inheritance, all their heavenly happiness; as much as the
				       whole body has all its pleasure of music by the ear, and all the
				       pleasure of its food by the mouth and stomach; and all the benefit
				       and refreshment of the air by the lungs. The saints while on earth
				       pray and labor for the same thing that Christ labored for, viz.,
				       the advancement of the kingdom of God among men, the promoting of
				       the prosperity of Zion, and flourishing of religion in this world;
				       and most of them have suffered for that end as Christ did, have
				       been made partakers with their head in his sufferings, and "filled
				       up (as the apostle expresses it) that which is behind of the
				       sufferings of Christ:" and therefore they shall partake with him of
				       the glory and joy of the end obtained. Rom. viii. 17, "We are joint
				       heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
				       also glorified together." 2 Tim. ii. 12, "If we suffer with him, we
				       shall also reign with him." Christ, when his sufferings were past,
				       and he left the earth and ascended into heaven, was so far from
				       having done with kingdom in this world, that it was as it were but
				       then begun: and he ascended for that very end, that he might more
				       fully possess and enjoy this kingdom, that he might reign in it,
				       and be under the best advantages for it; as much as a king ascends
				       a throne in order to reign over his people, and receive the honor
				       and glory of his dominion. No more have the saints done with
				       Christ's kingdom on earth, when they leave the earth and ascend
				       into heaven. "Christ came (i.e., ascended) with clouds of heaven,
				       and came to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before him,
				       to the very end, that he might receive dominion, and glory, and a
				       kingdom, that all people, nations and languages, should serve him,"
				       Dan. vii. 13, 14. Which shall be eminently fulfilled after the ruin
				       of Antichrist, which is especially the time of Christ's kingdom.
				       And the same is the time when "the kingdom and dominion, and
				       greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to
				       the people of the saints of the Most High God;" as verse 27, in the
				       same chapter. It is because they shall reign in and with Christ,
				       the Most High, as seems intimated in the words that follow; "whose
				       kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve
				       and obey him." This verse is true, not only of the saints on earth,
				       but also the saints in heaven. Hence the saints in heaven, having
				       respect to this time, do sing, in Rev. v. 10, "We shall reign on
				       the earth." And agreeably hereto, it is afterwards represented,
				       that when the forementioned time comes, the souls of them that in
				       former ages had suffered with Christ do reign with Christ; having
				       as it were given to them new life and joy, in that spiritual
				       blessed resurrection, which shall then be of the church of God on
				       earth; and thus it is that it is said, Matt. v. 5, "The meek (those
				       that meekly and patiently suffer with Christ, and for his sake)
				       shall inherit the earth:" they shall inherit it, and reign on earth
				       with Christ. Christ is the heir of the world; and when the
				       appointed time of his kingdom comes, his inheritance shall be given
				       him, and then the meek, who are joint heirs, shall inherit the
				       earth. The place in the Old Testament whence the words are taken,
				       leads to a true interpretation of them. Psal. xxxvii. 11, "The meek
				       shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the
				       abundance of peace." That there is reference in these latter words,
				       "the abundance of peace," to the peace and blessedness of the
				       latter days, we may be satisfied by comparing these words with
				       Psal. lxxii. 7," In his days shall be abundance of peace so long as
				       the moon endureth:" and Jer. xxxiii. 6, "I will reveal to them the
				       abundance of peace and truth:" also Isai. ii. 4, Micah iv. 3, Isai.
				       xi. 6-9, and many other parallel places. The saints in heaven will
				       be as much with Christ in reigning over the nations, and in the
				       glory of his dominion at that time, as they will he with him in the
				       honor of judging the world at the last day. That promise of Christ
				       to his disciples, Matt. xix. 28, 29, seems to have a special
				       respect to the former of these. In verse 28, Christ promises to the
				       disciples, that hereafter, "when the Son of Man shall sit on the
				       throne of his glory, they shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the
				       twelve tribes of Israel." The saints in heaven reigning on earth in
				       the glorious latter day, is described in language accommodated to
				       this promise of Christ, Rev. xx. 4: "And I saw thrones, and they
				       sat upon them; and judgment was given them. And they reigned with
				       Christ." And the promise in the next verse, in that xixth of
				       Matthew, seems to have its fulfillment at the same time: "And every
				       one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or fathers,
				       or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake shall receive a
				       hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life;" i.e., in the
				       time when the saints shall inherit the earth and reign on earth,
				       the earth, with all its blessings and good things, shall be given
				       in great abundance to the church, to be possessed by the saints.
				       This shall they receive in this present world, and in the time to
				       come everlasting life. The saints in heaven shall partake with
				       Christ in the triumph and glory of those victories that he shall
				       obtain in that future glorious time, over the kings and nations of
				       the world, that are sometimes represented by his ruling them with a
				       rod of iron, and dashing them in pieces as a potter's vessel. Which
				       doubtless there is respect to in Rev. ii. 26, 27: "He that
				       overcometh, and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give
				       power over the nations: (and he shall rule them with a rod of iron;
				       as the vessel of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:) even as
				       I received of my Father." And Psal. cxlix. 5, to the end: "Let the
				       saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds;"
				       i.e., in their separate state after death; compare Isai. lvii. 1,
				       2. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
				       sword in their hand: to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and
				       punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and
				       their nobles with fetters of iron, to execute upon them the
				       judgment written: this honor have all the saints." Accordingly when
				       Christ appears riding forth to his victory over Antichrist, Rev.
				       xix., the hosts of heaven appear going forth with him in robes of
				       triumph, verse 14. And when Antichrist is destroyed, the
				       inhabitants of heaven, and the holy apostles and prophets, are
				       called upon to rejoice, chap. xviii. 20. And accordingly the whole
				       multitude of the inhabitants of heaven, on that occasion, do appear
				       to exult and praise God with exceeding joy, chap. xix. 1?8, and
				       chap. xi. 15; and are also represented as greatly rejoicing on
				       occasion of the ruin of the heathen empire, in the days of
				       Constantine, chap xii. 10.
				</p><p>
				       And it is observable all along in the visions of that book, the
				       hosts of heaven appear as much concerned and interested in the
				       events appertaining to the kingdom of Christ here below, as the
				       saints on earth. The day of the commencement of the church's latter
				       day glory is eminently "the day of Christ's espousals; the day of
				       the gladness of his heart, when as the bridegroom rejoiceth over
				       the bride, so he will rejoice over his church." And then will all
				       heaven exceedingly rejoice with him. And therefore they say at that
				       time, Rev. xix. 7, "Let us be glad, and rejoice, and give glory to
				       him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come."
				       Thus Abraham enjoys these things when they come to pass, that were
				       of old promised to him, and that he saw beforehand, and rejoiced
				       in. He will enjoy the fulfilment of the promise of all the families
				       of the earth being blessed in his seed, when it shall be
				       accomplished. And all the ancient patriarchs, who died in faith of
				       promises of glorious things that should be accomplished in this
				       world, "who had not received the promises, but saw them afar off,
				       and were persuaded of them, and embraced them," do actually enjoy
				       them when fulfilled. David actually saw and enjoyed the fulfilment
				       of that promise, in its due time, which was made to him many
				       hundred years before, and was all his salvation and all his desire.
				       Thus Daniel shall stand in his lot at the end of the days pointed
				       out by his own prophecy. Thus the saints of old that died in faith,
				       not having received the promises, are made perfect, and have their
				       faith crowned by the better things accomplished in these latter
				       days of the gospel, Heb. xi. 39, 40, which they see and enjoy in
				       their time.
				</p><p>
				    3. The departed souls of saints have fellowship with Christ, in his
				       blessed and eternal employment of glorifying the Father.
				       The happiness of heaven consists not only in contemplation, and a
				       mere passive enjoyment, but consists very much in action. And
				       particularly in actively serving and glorifying God. This is
				       expressly mentioned as a great part of the blessedness of the
				       saints in their most perfect state, Rev. xxii. 3: "And there shall
				       be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in
				       it; and his servants shall serve him." The angels are as a flame of
				       fire in their ardor and activity in God's service: the four
				       animals, Rev. iv. (which are generally supposed to signify the
				       angels), are represented as continually giving praise and glory to
				       God, and are said not to rest day nor night, verse 8. The souls of
				       departed saints are, doubtless, become as the angels of God in
				       heaven in this respect. And Jesus Christ is the head of the whole
				       glorious assembly; as in other things appertaining to their blessed
				       state, so in this of their praising and glorifying the Father. When
				       Christ, the night before he was crucified, prayed for his
				       exaltation to glory, it was that he might glorify the Father: John
				       xvii. 1, "These words spake Jesus, and lift up his eyes to heaven,
				       and said, Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son
				       also may glorify thee." And this he doubtless does, now he is in
				       heaven; not only in fulfilling the Father's will, in what he does
				       as head of the church and ruler of the universe, but also in
				       leading the heavenly assembly in their praises. When Christ
				       instituted the Supper, and ate and drank with his disciples at his
				       table (giving them therein a representation and pledge of their
				       future feasting with him, and drinking new wine in his heavenly
				       Father's kingdom), he at that time led them in their praises to
				       God, in that hymn that they sang. And so doubtless he leads his
				       glorified disciples in heaven. David was the sweet psalmist of
				       Israel, and he led the great congregation of God's people in their
				       songs of praise. Herein, as well as in innumerable other things, he
				       was a type of Christ, who is often spoken of in Scripture by the
				       name of David. And many of the psalms that David penned, were songs
				       of praise, that he, by the spirit of prophecy, uttered in the name
				       of Christ, as Head of the church, and leading the saints in their
				       praises. Christ in heaven leads the glorious assembly in their
				       praises to God, as Moses did the congregation of Israel at the Red
				       Sea; which is implied in its being said, that "they sing the song
				       of Moses and the Lamb," Rev. xv. 2, 3. In Rev. xix. 5, John tells
				       us, that "he heard a voice come out of the throne, saying, Praise
				       our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and
				       great." Who can it be that utters this voice out of the throne, but
				       the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne, calling on the
				       glorious assembly of saints to praise his Father and their Father,
				       his God and their God? And what the consequence of this voice is,
				       we have an account in the next words: "And I heard as it were the
				       voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as
				       the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia; for the Lord God
				       omnipotent reigneth."
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">APPLICATION</hi>
				</p><p>
				   The use that I would make of what has been said on this subject is of
				   exhortation. Let us all be exhorted hence earnestly to seek after that
				   great privilege that has been spoken of, that when "we are absent from
				   the body, we may be present with the Lord." We cannot continue always
				   in these earthly tabernacles: they are very frail, and will soon decay
				   and fall; and are continually liable to be overthrown by innumerable
				   means: our souls must soon leave them, and go into the eternal world.
				   O, how infinitely great will the privilege and happiness of such be,
				   who at that time shall go to be with Christ in his glory, in the manner
				   that has been represented! The privilege of the twelve disciples was
				   great, in being so constantly with Christ as his family, in his state
				   of humiliation. The privilege of those three disciples was great, who
				   were with him in the mount of his transfiguration; where was exhibited
				   to them some little semblance of his future glory in heaven, such as
				   they might behold in the present frail, feeble, and sinful state: they
				   were greatly entertained and delighted with what they saw; and were for
				   making tabernacles to dwell there, and return no more down the mount.
				   And great was the privilege of Moses when he was with Christ in Mount
				   Sinai, and besought him to show him his glory, and he saw his back
				   parts as he passed by, and proclaimed his name. But is not that
				   privilege infinitely greater, that has now been spoken of, the
				   privilege of being with Christ in heaven, where he sits on the right
				   hand of God, in the glory of the King and God of angels, and of the
				   whole universe, shining forth as the great light, the bright sun of
				   that world of glory; there to dwell in the full, constant and
				   everlasting view of his beauty and brightness; there most freely and
				   intimately to converse with him, and fully to enjoy his love, as his
				   friends and spouse; there to have fellowship with him in the infinite
				   pleasure and joy he has in the enjoyment of his Father; there to sit
				   with him on his throne, and reign with him in the possession of all
				   things, and partake with him in the joy and glory of his victory over
				   his enemies, and the advancement of his kingdom in the world, and to
				   join with him in joyful songs of praise to his Father and their Father,
				   to his God and their God, forever and ever? Is not such a privilege
				   worth the seeking after?
				</p><p>
				   But here, as a special enforcement of this exhortation, I would improve
				   that dispensation of God's holy providence, that is the sorrowful
				   occasion of our coming together at this time, viz., the death of that
				   eminent servant of Jesus Christ, in the work of the gospel ministry,
				   whose funeral is this day to be attended; together with what was
				   observable in him, living and dying.
				</p><p>
				   In this dispensation of Providence, God puts us in mind of our
				   mortality, and forewarns us that the time is approaching when we must
				   be absent from the body, and "must all appear (as the apostle observes
				   in the next verse but one to my text) before the judgment seat of
				   Christ, that every one of us may receive the things done in the body,
				   according to what we have done, whether it be good or bad."
				</p><p>
				   And in him, whose death we are now called to consider and improve, we
				   have not only an instance of mortality, but an instance of one that,
				   being absent from the body, is present with the Lord; as we have all
				   imaginable reason to conclude. And that, whether we consider the nature
				   of the operations he was under, about the time whence he dates his
				   conversion, or the nature and course of his inward exercises from that
				   time forward, or his outward conversation and long space wherein he
				   looked death in the face.
				</p><p>
				   His convictions of sin, preceding his first consolations in Christ (as
				   appears by a written account he has left of his inward exercises and
				   experiences), were exceeding deep and thorough: his trouble and
				   exercise of mind, through a sense of guilt and misery, very great and
				   long continued, but yet sound and solid; consisting in no unsteady,
				   violent and unaccountable hurries and frights, and strange
				   perturbations of mind; but arising from the most serious consideration,
				   and proper illumination of the conscience to discern and consider the
				   true state of things. And the light let into his mind at conversion,
				   and the influences and exercises that his mind was subject to at that
				   time, appear very agreeable to reason and the gospel of Jesus Christ;
				   the change very great and remarkable, without any appearance of strong
				   impressions on the imagination, sudden flights and pangs of the
				   affections, and vehement emotions in animal nature; but attended with
				   proper intellectual views of the supreme glory of the divine Being,
				   consisting in the infinite dignity and beauty of the perfections of his
				   nature, and of the transcendent excellency of the way of salvation by
				   Christ. This was about eight years ago, when he was about twenty-one
				   years of age.
				</p><p>
				   Thus God sanctified and made meet for his use, that vessel that he
				   intended to make eminently a vessel of honor in his house, and which he
				   had made of large capacity, having endowed him with very uncommon
				   abilities and gifts of nature. He was a singular instance of a ready
				   invention, natural eloquence, easy flowing expression, sprightly
				   apprehension, quick discerning, and a very strong memory; and yet of a
				   very penetrating genius, close and clear thought, and piercing
				   judgment. He had an exact taste: his understanding was (if I may so
				   express it) of a quick, strong and distinguishing scent.
				</p><p>
				   His learning was very considerable: he had a great taste for learning;
				   and applied himself to his studies in so close a manner when he was at
				   college, that he much injured his health; and was obliged on that
				   account for a while to leave the college, throw by his studies and
				   return home. He was esteemed one that excelled in learning in that
				   society.
				</p><p>
				   He had an extraordinary knowledge of men, as well as things. Had a
				   great insight into human nature, and excelled most that ever I knew in
				   a communicative faculty: he had a peculiar talent at accommodating
				   himself to the capacities, tempers and circumstances, of those that he
				   would instruct or counsel.
				</p><p>
				   He had extraordinary gifts for the pulpit: I never had opportunity to
				   hear him preach, but have often heard him pray: and I think his manner
				   of addressing himself to God, and expressing himself before him, in
				   that duty, almost inimitable; such (so far as I may judge) as I have
				   very rarely known equalled. He expressed himself with that exact
				   propriety and pertinency, in such significant, weighty, pungent
				   expressions; with that decent appearance of sincerity, reverence, and
				   solemnity, and great distance from all affectation, as forgetting the
				   presence of men, and as being in the immediate presence of a great and
				   holy God, that I have scarcely ever known paralleled. And his manner of
				   preaching, by what I have often heard of it from good judges, was no
				   less excellent; being clear and instructive, natural, nervous,
				   forcible, and moving, and very searching and convincing. He nauseated
				   an affected noisiness, and violent boisterousness in the pulpit; and
				   yet much disrelished a flat, cold delivery, when the subject of
				   discourse, and matter delivered, required affection and earnestness.
				</p><p>
				   Not only had he excellent talents for the study and the pulpit, but
				   also for conversation. He was of a sociable disposition; and was
				   remarkably free, entertaining, and profitable in ordinary discourse;
				   and had much of a faculty of disputing, defending truth and confuting
				   error.
				</p><p>
				   As he excelled in his judgment and knowledge of things in general, so
				   especially in divinity. He was truly, for one of his standing, an
				   extraordinary divine. But above all, in matters relating to
				   experimental religion. In this, I know I have the concurring opinion of
				   some that have had a name for persons of the best judgment. And
				   according to what ability I have to judge things of this nature, and
				   according to my opportunities, which of late have been very great, I
				   never knew his equal, of his age and standing, for clear, accurate
				   notions of the nature and essence of true religion, and its
				   distinctions from its various false appearances; which I suppose to be
				   owing to these three things meeting together in him;-the strength of
				   his natural genius, and the great opportunities he had of observation
				   of others, in various parts, both white people and Indians, and his own
				   great experience.
				</p><p>
				   His experiences of the holy influences of God's Spirit were not only
				   great at his first conversion, but they were so, in a continued course,
				   from that time forward; as appears by a record, or private journal, he
				   kept of his daily inward exercises, from the time of his conversion,
				   until he was disabled by the failing of his strength, a few days before
				   his death. The change which he looked upon as his conversion, was not
				   only a great change of the present views, affections, and frame of his
				   mind; but was evidently the beginning of that work of God on his heart,
				   which God carried on, in a very wonderful manner, from that time to his
				   dying day. He greatly abhorred the way of such, as live on their first
				   work, as though they had now got through their work, and are thence
				   forward, by degrees, settled in a cold, lifeless, negligent, worldly
				   frame; he had an ill opinion of such persons' religion. [3]
				</p><p>
				   Oh that the things that were seen and heard in this extraordinary
				   person, his holiness, heavenliness, labor and self- denial in life, his
				   so remarkably devoting himself and his all, in heart and practice, to
				   the glory of God, and the wonderful frame of mind manifested, in so
				   steadfast a manner, under the expectation of death, and the pains and
				   agonies that brought it on, may excite in us all, both ministers and
				   people, a due sense of the greatness of the work we have to do in the
				   world, the excellency and amiableness of thorough religion in
				   experience and practice, and the blessedness of the end of such, whose
				   death finishes such a life, and the infinite value of their eternal
				   reward, when absent from the body and present with the Lord; and
				   effectually stir us up to endeavors, that in the way of such a holy
				   life we may at least come to so blessed an end. AMEN.
