				   In this verse is threatened the vengeance of God on the wicked
				   unbelieving Israelites, who were God's visible people, and who lived
				   under the means of grace; but who, notwithstanding all God's wonderful
				   works towards them, remained (as vers 28.) void of counsel, having no
				   understanding in them. Under all the cultivations of heaven, they
				   brought forth bitter and poisonous fruit; as in the two verses next
				   preceding the text. - The expression I have chosen for my text, their
				   foot shall slide in due time, seems to imply the following things,
				   relating to the punishment and destruction to which these wicked
				   Israelites were exposed.
				</p><p>
				    1. That they were always exposed to destruction; as one that stands or
				       walks in slippery places is always exposed to fall. This is implied
				       in the manner of their destruction coming upon them, being
				       represented by their foot sliding. The same is expressed, <reference osisRef="Ps.73.18">Psalms 73:18</reference>. "Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou
				       castedst them down into destruction."
				</p><p>
				    2. It implies, that they were always exposed to sudden unexpected
				       destruction. As he that walks in slippery places is every moment
				       liable to fall, he cannot foresee one moment whether he shall stand
				       or fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once without
				       warning: Which is also expressed in <reference osisRef="Ps.73.18 Ps.73.19">Psalms 73:18-19</reference>. "Surely thou
				       didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into
				       destruction: How are they brought into desolation as in a moment!"
				</p><p>
				    3. Another thing implied is, that they are liable to fall of
				       themselves, without being thrown down by the hand of another; as he
				       that stands or walks on slippery ground needs nothing but his own
				       weight to throw him down.
				</p><p>
				    4. That the reason why they are not fallen already and do not fall now
				       is only that God's appointed time is not come. For it is said, that
				       when that due time, or appointed time comes, their foot shall
				       slide. Then they shall be left to fall, as they are inclined by
				       their own weight. God will not hold them up in these slippery
				       places any longer, but will let them go; and then, at that very
				       instant, they shall fall into destruction; as he that stands on
				       such slippery declining ground, on the edge of a pit, he cannot
				       stand alone, when he is let go he immediately falls and is lost.
				</p><p>
				   The observation from the words that I would now insist upon is this. -
				   "There is nothing that keeps wicked men at any one moment out of hell,
				   but the mere pleasure of God." - By the mere pleasure of God, I mean
				   his sovereign pleasure, his arbitrary will, restrained by no
				   obligation, hindered by no manner of difficulty, any more than if
				   nothing else but God's mere will had in the least degree, or in any
				   respect whatsoever, any hand in the preservation of wicked men one
				   moment. - The truth of this observation may appear by the following
				   consideration.
				</p><p>
				    1. There is no want of power in God to cast wicked men into hell at
				       any moment. Men's hands cannot be strong when God rises up. The
				       strongest have no power to resist him, nor can any deliver out of
				       his hands. - He is not only able to cast wicked men into hell, but
				       he can most easily do it. Sometimes an earthly prince meets with a
				       great deal of difficulty to subdue a rebel, who has found means to
				       fortify himself, and has made himself strong by the numbers of his
				       followers. But it is not so with God. There is no fortress that is
				       any defence from the power of God. Though hand join in hand, and
				       vast multitudes of God's enemies combine and associate themselves,
				       they are easily broken in pieces. They are as great heaps of light
				       chaff before the whirlwind; or large quantities of dry stubble
				       before devouring flames. We find it easy to tread on and crush a
				       worm that we see crawling on the earth; so it is easy for us to cut
				       or singe a slender thread that any thing hangs by: thus easy is it
				       for God, when he pleases, to cast his enemies down to hell. What
				       are we, that we should think to stand before him, at whose rebuke
				       the earth trembles, and before whom the rocks are thrown down?
				</p><p>
				    2. They deserve to be cast into hell; so that divine justice never
				       stands in the way, it makes no objection against God's using his
				       power at any moment to destroy them. Yea, on the contrary, justice
				       calls aloud for an infinite punishment of their sins. Divine
				       justice says of the tree that brings forth such grapes of Sodom,
				       "Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?" <reference osisRef="Luke.13.7">Luke 13:7</reference>. The sword of
				       divine justice is every moment brandished over their heads, and it
				       is nothing but the hand of arbitrary mercy, and God's mere will,
				       that holds it back.
				</p><p>
				    3. They are already under a sentence of condemnation to hell. They do
				       not only justly deserve to be cast down thither, but the sentence
				       of the law of God, that eternal and immutable rule of righteousness
				       that God has fixed between him and mankind, is gone out against
				       them, and stands against them; so that they are bound over already
				       to hell. <reference osisRef="John.3.18">John 3:18</reference>. "He that believeth not is condemned already."
				       So that every unconverted man properly belongs to hell; that is his
				       place; from thence he is, <reference osisRef="John.8.23">John 8:23</reference>. "Ye are from beneath:" And
				       thither he is bound; it is the place that justice, and God's word,
				       and the sentence of his unchangeable law assign to him.
				</p><p>
				    4. They are now the objects of that very same anger and wrath of God,
				       that is expressed in the torments of hell. And the reason why they
				       do not go down to hell at each moment, is not because God, in whose
				       power they are, is not then very angry with them; as he is with
				       many miserable creatures now tormented in hell, who there feel and
				       bear the fierceness of his wrath. Yea, God is a great deal more
				       angry with great numbers that are now on earth: yea, doubtless,
				       with many that are now in this congregation, who it may be are at
				       ease, than he is with many of those who are now in the flames of
				       hell.
				       So that it is not because God is unmindful of their wickedness, and
				       does not resent it, that he does not let loose his hand and cut
				       them off. God is not altogether such an one as themselves, though
				       they may imagine him to be so. The wrath of God burns against them,
				       their damnation does not slumber; the pit is prepared, the fire is
				       made ready, the furnace is now hot, ready to receive them; the
				       flames do now rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet, and held
				       over them, and the pit hath opened its mouth under them.
				</p><p>
				    5. The devil stands ready to fall upon them, and seize them as his
				       own, at what moment God shall permit him. They belong to him; he
				       has their souls in his possession, and under his dominion. The
				       scripture represents them as his goods, <reference osisRef="Luke.11.12">Luke 11:12</reference>. The devils
				       watch them; they are ever by them at their right hand; they stand
				       waiting for them, like greedy hungry lions that see their prey, and
				       expect to have it, but are for the present kept back. If God should
				       withdraw his hand, by which they are restrained, they would in one
				       moment fly upon their poor souls. The old serpent is gaping for
				       them; hell opens its mouth wide to receive them; and if God should
				       permit it, they would be hastily swallowed up and lost.
				</p><p>
				    6. There are in the souls of wicked men those hellish principles
				       reigning, that would presently kindle and flame out into hell fire,
				       if it were not for God's restraints. There is laid in the very
				       nature of carnal men, a foundation for the torments of hell. There
				       are those corrupt principles, in reigning power in them, and in
				       full possession of them, that are seeds of hell fire. These
				       principles are active and powerful, exceeding violent in their
				       nature, and if it were not for the restraining hand of God upon
				       them, they would soon break out, they would flame out after the
				       same manner as the same corruptions, the same enmity does in the
				       hearts of damned souls, and would beget the same torments as they
				       do in them. The souls of the wicked are in scripture compared to
				       the troubled sea, <reference osisRef="Isa.57.20">Isaiah 57:20</reference>. For the present, God restrains their
				       wickedness by his mighty power, as he does the raging waves of the
				       troubled sea, saying, "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further;"
				       but if God should withdraw that restraining power, it would soon
				       carry all before it. Sin is the ruin and misery of the soul; it is
				       destructive in its nature; and if God should leave it without
				       restraint, there would need nothing else to make the soul perfectly
				       miserable. The corruption of the heart of man is immoderate and
				       boundless in its fury; and while wicked men live here, it is like
				       fire pent up by God's restraints, whereas if it were let loose, it
				       would set on fire the course of nature; and as the heart is now a
				       sink of sin, so if sin was not restrained, it would immediately
				       turn the soul into fiery oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone.
				</p><p>
				    7. It is no security to wicked men for one moment, that there are no
				       visible means of death at hand. It is no security to a natural man,
				       that he is now in health, and that he does not see which way he
				       should now immediately go out of the world by any accident, and
				       that there is no visible danger in any respect in his
				       circumstances. The manifold and continual experience of the world
				       in all ages, shows this is no evidence, that a man is not on the
				       very brink of eternity, and that the next step will not be into
				       another world. The unseen, unthought-of ways and means of persons
				       going suddenly out of the world are innumerable and inconceivable.
				       Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering, and
				       there are innumerable places in this covering so weak that they
				       will not bear their weight, and these places are not seen. The
				       arrows of death fly unseen at noon-day; the sharpest sight cannot
				       discern them. God has so many different unsearchable ways of taking
				       wicked men out of the world and sending them to hell, that there is
				       nothing to make it appear, that God had need to be at the expense
				       of a miracle, or go out of the ordinary course of his providence,
				       to destroy any wicked man, at any moment. All the means that there
				       are of sinners going out of the world, are so in God's hands, and
				       so universally and absolutely subject to his power and
				       determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere
				       will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than
				       if means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.
				</p><p>
				    8. Natural men's prudence and care to preserve their own lives, or the
				       care of others to preserve them, do not secure them a moment. To
				       this, divine providence and universal experience do also bear
				       testimony. There is this clear evidence that men's own wisdom is no
				       security to them from death; that if it were otherwise we should
				       see some difference between the wise and politic men of the world,
				       and others, with regard to their liableness to early and unexpected
				       death: but how is it in fact? <reference osisRef="Eccl.2.16">Ecclesiastes 2:16</reference>. "How dieth the wise
				       man? even as the fool."
				</p><p>
				    9. All wicked men's pains and contrivance which they use to escape
				       hell, while they continue to reject Christ, and so remain wicked
				       men, do not secure them from hell one moment. Almost every natural
				       man that hears of hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it;
				       he depends upon himself for his own security; he flatters himself
				       in what he has done, in what he is now doing, or what he intends to
				       do. Every one lays out matters in his own mind how he shall avoid
				       damnation, and flatters himself that he contrives well for himself,
				       and that his schemes will not fail. They hear indeed that there are
				       but few saved, and that the greater part of men that have died
				       heretofore are gone to hell; but each one imagines that he lays out
				       matters better for his own escape than others have done. He does
				       not intend to come to that place of torment; he says within
				       himself, that he intends to take effectual care, and to order
				       matters so for himself as not to fail.
				       But the foolish children of men miserably delude themselves in
				       their own schemes, and in confidence in their own strength and
				       wisdom; they trust to nothing but a shadow. The greater part of
				       those who heretofore have lived under the same means of grace, and
				       are now dead, are undoubtedly gone to hell; and it was not because
				       they were not as wise as those who are now alive: it was not
				       because they did not lay out matters as well for themselves to
				       secure their own escape. If we could speak with them, and inquire
				       of them, one by one, whether they expected, when alive, and when
				       they used to hear about hell, ever to be the subjects of misery: we
				       doubtless, should hear one and another reply, "No, I never intended
				       to come here: I had laid out matters otherwise in my mind; I
				       thought I should contrive well for myself - I thought my scheme
				       good. I intended to take effectual care; but it came upon me
				       unexpected; I did not look for it at that time, and in that manner;
				       it came as a thief - Death outwitted me: God's wrath was too quick
				       for me. Oh, my cursed foolishness! I was flattering myself, and
				       pleasing myself with vain dreams of what I would do hereafter; and
				       when I was saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction came
				       upon me."
				</p><p>
				   10. God has laid himself under no obligation, by any promise to keep
				       any natural man out of hell one moment. God certainly has made no
				       promises either of eternal life, or of any deliverance or
				       preservation from eternal death, but what are contained in the
				       covenant of grace, the promises that are given in Christ, in whom
				       all the promises are yea and amen. But surely they have no interest
				       in the promises of the covenant of grace who are not the children
				       of the covenant, who do not believe in any of the promises, and
				       have no interest in the Mediator of the covenant.
				</p><p>
				   So that, whatever some have imagined and pretended about promises made
				   to natural men's earnest seeking and knocking, it is plain and
				   manifest, that whatever pains a natural man takes in religion, whatever
				   prayers he makes, till he believes in Christ, God is under no manner of
				   obligation to keep him a moment from eternal destruction.
				</p><p>
				   So that, thus it is that natural men are held in the hand of God, over
				   the pit of hell; they have deserved the fiery pit, and are already
				   sentenced to it; and God is dreadfully provoked, his anger is as great
				   towards them as to those that are actually suffering the executions of
				   the fierceness of his wrath in hell, and they have done nothing in the
				   least to appease or abate that anger, neither is God in the least bound
				   by any promise to hold them up one moment; the devil is waiting for
				   them, hell is gaping for them, the flames gather and flash about them,
				   and would fain lay hold on them, and swallow them up; the fire pent up
				   in their own hearts is struggling to break out: and they have no
				   interest in any Mediator, there are no means within reach that can be
				   any security to them. In short, they have no refuge, nothing to take
				   hold of; all that preserves them every moment is the mere arbitrary
				   will, and uncovenanted, unobliged forbearance of an incensed God.
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">Application</hi>
				</p><p>
				   The use of this awful subject may be for awakening unconverted persons
				   in this congregation. This that you have heard is the case of every one
				   of you that are out of Christ. - That world of misery, that lake of
				   burning brimstone, is extended abroad under you. There is the dreadful
				   pit of the glowing flames of the wrath of God; there is hell's wide
				   gaping mouth open; and you have nothing to stand upon, nor any thing to
				   take hold of; there is nothing between you and hell but the air; it is
				   only the power and mere pleasure of God that holds you up.
				</p><p>
				   You probably are not sensible of this; you find you are kept out of
				   hell, but do not see the hand of God in it; but look at other things,
				   as the good state of your bodily constitution, your care of your own
				   life, and the means you use for your own preservation. But indeed these
				   things are nothing; if God should withdraw his hand, they would avail
				   no more to keep you from falling, than the thin air to hold up a person
				   that is suspended in it.
				</p><p>
				   Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend
				   downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God
				   should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and
				   plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and
				   your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your
				   righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you
				   out of hell, than a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock.
				   Were it not for the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not bear
				   you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans with
				   you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your corruption,
				   not willingly; the sun does not willingly shine upon you to give you
				   light to serve sin and Satan; the earth does not willingly yield her
				   increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage for your
				   wickedness to be acted upon; the air does not willingly serve you for
				   breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you spend
				   your life in the service of God's enemies. God's creatures are good,
				   and were made for men to serve God with, and do not willingly subserve
				   to any other purpose, and groan when they are abused to purposes so
				   directly contrary to their nature and end. And the world would spew you
				   out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath subjected it in
				   hope. There are the black clouds of God's wrath now hanging directly
				   over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big with thunder; and
				   were it not for the restraining hand of God, it would immediately burst
				   forth upon you. The sovereign pleasure of God, for the present, stays
				   his rough wind; otherwise it would come with fury, and your destruction
				   would come like a whirlwind, and you would be like the chaff on the
				   summer threshing floor.
				</p><p>
				   The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present;
				   they increase more and more, and rise higher and higher, till an outlet
				   is given; and the longer the stream is stopped, the more rapid and
				   mighty is its course, when once it is let loose. It is true, that
				   judgment against your evil works has not been executed hitherto; the
				   floods of God's vengeance have been withheld; but your guilt in the
				   mean time is constantly increasing, and you are every day treasuring up
				   more wrath; the waters are constantly rising, and waxing more and more
				   mighty; and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, that holds
				   the waters back, that are unwilling to be stopped, and press hard to go
				   forward. If God should only withdraw his hand from the flood-gate, it
				   would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and
				   wrath of God, would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come
				   upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength were ten thousand
				   times greater than it is, yea, ten thousand times greater than the
				   strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it would be nothing
				   to withstand or endure it.
				</p><p>
				   The bow of God's wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string,
				   and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it
				   is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an angry God,
				   without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the arrow one
				   moment from being made drunk with your blood. Thus all you that never
				   passed under a great change of heart, by the mighty power of the Spirit
				   of God upon your souls; all you that were never born again, and made
				   new creatures, and raised from being dead in sin, to a state of new,
				   and before altogether unexperienced light and life, are in the hands of
				   an angry God. However you may have reformed your life in many things,
				   and may have had religious affections, and may keep up a form of
				   religion in your families and closets, and in the house of God, it is
				   nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being this moment
				   swallowed up in everlasting destruction. However unconvinced you may
				   now be of the truth of what you hear, by and by you will be fully
				   convinced of it. Those that are gone from being in the like
				   circumstances with you, see that it was so with them; for destruction
				   came suddenly upon most of them; when they expected nothing of it, and
				   while they were saying, Peace and safety: now they see, that those
				   things on which they depended for peace and safety, were nothing but
				   thin air and empty shadows.
				</p><p>
				   The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a
				   spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is
				   dreadfully provoked: his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks
				   upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire; he is
				   of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight; you are ten
				   thousand times more abominable in his eyes, than the most hateful
				   venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more than
				   ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but his
				   hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment. It is to
				   be ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell the last
				   night; that you was suffered to awake again in this world, after you
				   closed your eyes to sleep. And there is no other reason to be given,
				   why you have not dropped into hell since you arose in the morning, but
				   that God's hand has held you up. There is no other reason to be given
				   why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat here in the house of
				   God, provoking his pure eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending
				   his solemn worship. Yea, there is nothing else that is to be given as a
				   reason why you do not this very moment drop down into hell.
				</p><p>
				   O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great furnace
				   of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that
				   you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and
				   incensed as much against you, as against many of the damned in hell.
				   You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing
				   about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; and
				   you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to
				   save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your
				   own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to
				   induce God to spare you one moment. - And consider here more
				   particularly,
				</p><p>
				    1. Whose wrath it is: it is the wrath of the infinite God. If it were
				       only the wrath of man, though it were of the most potent prince, it
				       would be comparatively little to be regarded. The wrath of kings is
				       very much dreaded, especially of absolute monarchs, who have the
				       possessions and lives of their subjects wholly in their power, to
				       be disposed of at their mere will. <reference osisRef="Prov.20.2">Proverbs 20:2</reference>. "The fear of a king
				       is as the roaring of a lion: Whoso provoketh him to anger, sinneth
				       against his own soul." The subject that very much enrages an
				       arbitrary prince, is liable to suffer the most extreme torments
				       that human art can invent, or human power can inflict. But the
				       greatest earthly potentates in their greatest majesty and strength,
				       and when clothed in their greatest terrors, are but feeble,
				       despicable worms of the dust, in comparison of the great and
				       almighty Creator and King of heaven and earth. It is but little
				       that they can do, when most enraged, and when they have exerted the
				       utmost of their fury. All the kings of the earth, before God, are
				       as grasshoppers; they are nothing, and less than nothing: both
				       their love and their hatred is to be despised. The wrath of the
				       great King of kings, is as much more terrible than theirs, as his
				       majesty is greater. <reference osisRef="Luke.12.4 Luke.12.5">Luke 12:4-5</reference>. "And I say unto you, my friends,
				       Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, have no
				       more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom you shall fear:
				       fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell:
				       yea, I say unto you, Fear him."
				</p><p>
				    2. It is the fierceness of his wrath that you are exposed to. We often
				       read of the fury of God; as in <reference osisRef="Isa.59.18">Isaiah 59:18</reference>. "According to their
				       deeds, accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries." So <reference osisRef="Isa.66.15">Isaiah 66:15</reference>. "For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his
				       chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his
				       rebuke with flames of fire." And in many other places. So, <reference osisRef="Rev.19.15">Revelation of John 19:15</reference>, we read of "the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of
				       Almighty God." The words are exceeding terrible. If it had only
				       been said, "the wrath of God," the words would have implied that
				       which is infinitely dreadful: but it is "the fierceness and wrath
				       of God." The fury of God! the fierceness of Jehovah! Oh, how
				       dreadful that must be! Who can utter or conceive what such
				       expressions carry in them! But it is also "the fierceness and wrath
				       of almighty God." As though there would be a very great
				       manifestation of his almighty power in what the fierceness of his
				       wrath should inflict, as though omnipotence should be as it were
				       enraged, and exerted, as men are wont to exert their strength in
				       the fierceness of their wrath. Oh! then, what will be the
				       consequence! What will become of the poor worms that shall suffer
				       it! Whose hands can be strong? And whose heart can endure? To what
				       a dreadful, inexpressible, inconceivable depth of misery must the
				       poor creature be sunk who shall be the subject of this!
				       Consider this, you that are here present, that yet remain in an
				       unregenerate state. That God will execute the fierceness of his
				       anger, implies, that he will inflict wrath without any pity. When
				       God beholds the ineffable extremity of your case, and sees your
				       torment to be so vastly disproportioned to your strength, and sees
				       how your poor soul is crushed, and sinks down, as it were, into an
				       infinite gloom; he will have no compassion upon you, he will not
				       forbear the executions of his wrath, or in the least lighten his
				       hand; there shall be no moderation or mercy, nor will God then at
				       all stay his rough wind; he will have no regard to your welfare,
				       nor be at all careful lest you should suffer too much in any other
				       sense, than only that you shall not suffer beyond what strict
				       justice requires. Nothing shall be withheld, because it is so hard
				       for you to bear. <reference osisRef="Ezek.8.18">Ezekiel 8:18</reference>. "Therefore will I also deal in fury:
				       mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they
				       cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them." Now
				       God stands ready to pity you; this is a day of mercy; you may cry
				       now with some encouragement of obtaining mercy. But when once the
				       day of mercy is past, your most lamentable and dolorous cries and
				       shrieks will be in vain; you will be wholly lost and thrown away of
				       God, as to any regard to your welfare. God will have no other use
				       to put you to, but to suffer misery; you shall be continued in
				       being to no other end; for you will be a vessel of wrath fitted to
				       destruction; and there will be no other use of this vessel, but to
				       be filled full of wrath. God will be so far from pitying you when
				       you cry to him, that it is said he will only "laugh and mock,"
				       <reference osisRef="Prov.1.25 Prov.1.26">Proverbs 1:25-26</reference>,etc.
				       How awful are those words, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.3">Isaiah 63:3</reference>, which are the words of the
				       great God. "I will tread them in mine anger, and will trample them
				       in my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments,
				       and I will stain all my raiment." It is perhaps impossible to
				       conceive of words that carry in them greater manifestations of
				       these three things, viz. contempt, and hatred, and fierceness of
				       indignation. If you cry to God to pity you, he will be so far from
				       pitying you in your doleful case, or showing you the least regard
				       or favour, that instead of that, he will only tread you under foot.
				       And though he will know that you cannot bear the weight of
				       omnipotence treading upon you, yet he will not regard that, but he
				       will crush you under his feet without mercy; he will crush out your
				       blood, and make it fly, and it shall be sprinkled on his garments,
				       so as to stain all his raiment. He will not only hate you, but he
				       will have you in the utmost contempt: no place shall be thought fit
				       for you, but under his feet to be trodden down as the mire of the
				       streets.
				</p><p>
				    3. The misery you are exposed to is that which God will inflict to
				       that end, that he might show what that wrath of Jehovah is. God
				       hath had it on his heart to show to angels and men, both how
				       excellent his love is, and also how terrible his wrath is.
				       Sometimes earthly kings have a mind to show how terrible their
				       wrath is, by the extreme punishments they would execute on those
				       that would provoke them. Nebuchadnezzar, that mighty and haughty
				       monarch of the Chaldean empire, was willing to show his wrath when
				       enraged with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and accordingly gave
				       orders that the burning fiery furnace should be heated seven times
				       hotter than it was before; doubtless, it was raised to the utmost
				       degree of fierceness that human art could raise it. But the great
				       God is also willing to show his wrath, and magnify his awful
				       majesty and mighty power in the extreme sufferings of his enemies.
				       <reference osisRef="Rom.9.22">Romans 9:22</reference>. "What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his
				       power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath
				       fitted to destruction?" And seeing this is his design, and what he
				       has determined, even to show how terrible the unrestrained wrath,
				       the fury and fierceness of Jehovah is, he will do it to effect.
				       There will be something accomplished and brought to pass that will
				       be dreadful with a witness. When the great and angry God hath risen
				       up and executed his awful vengeance on the poor sinner, and the
				       wretch is actually suffering the infinite weight and power of his
				       indignation, then will God call upon the whole universe to behold
				       that awful majesty and mighty power that is to be seen in it. <reference osisRef="Isa.33.12 Isa.33.13 Isa.33.14">Isaiah 33:12-14</reference>. "And the people shall be as the burnings of lime, as
				       thorns cut up shall they be burnt in the fire. Hear ye that are far
				       off, what I have done; and ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
				       The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
				       hypocrites," etc.
				       Thus it will be with you that are in an unconverted state, if you
				       continue in it; the infinite might, and majesty, and terribleness
				       of the omnipotent God shall be magnified upon you, in the ineffable
				       strength of your torments. You shall be tormented in the presence
				       of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and when you
				       shall be in this state of suffering, the glorious inhabitants of
				       heaven shall go forth and look on the awful spectacle, that they
				       may see what the wrath and fierceness of the Almighty is; and when
				       they have seen it, they will fall down and adore that great power
				       and majesty. <reference osisRef="Isa.66.23 Isa.66.24">Isaiah 66:23-24</reference>. "And it shall come to pass, that from
				       one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all
				       flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. And they shall go
				       forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed
				       against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire
				       be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."
				</p><p>
				    4. It is everlasting wrath. It would be dreadful to suffer this
				       fierceness and wrath of Almighty God one moment; but you must
				       suffer it to all eternity. There will be no end to this exquisite
				       horrible misery. When you look forward, you shall see a long for
				       ever, a boundless duration before you, which will swallow up your
				       thoughts, and amaze your soul; and you will absolutely despair of
				       ever having any deliverance, any end, any mitigation, any rest at
				       all. You will know certainly that you must wear out long ages,
				       millions of millions of ages, in wrestling and conflicting with
				       this almighty merciless vengeance; and then when you have so done,
				       when so many ages have actually been spent by you in this manner,
				       you will know that all is but a point to what remains. So that your
				       punishment will indeed be infinite. Oh, who can express what the
				       state of a soul in such circumstances is! All that we can possibly
				       say about it, gives but a very feeble, faint representation of it;
				       it is inexpressible and inconceivable: For "who knows the power of
				       God's anger?"
				</p><p>
				</p><p>
				   How dreadful is the state of those that are daily and hourly in the
				   danger of this great wrath and infinite misery! But this is the dismal
				   case of every soul in this congregation that has not been born again,
				   however moral and strict, sober and religious, they may otherwise be.
				   Oh that you would consider it, whether you be young or old! There is
				   reason to think, that there are many in this congregation now hearing
				   this discourse, that will actually be the subjects of this very misery
				   to all eternity. We know not who they are, or in what seats they sit,
				   or what thoughts they now have. It may be they are now at ease, and
				   hear all these things without much disturbance, and are now flattering
				   themselves that they are not the persons, promising themselves that
				   they shall escape. If we knew that there was one person, and but one,
				   in the whole congregation, that was to be the subject of this misery,
				   what an awful thing would it be to think of! If we knew who it was,
				   what an awful sight would it be to see such a person! How might all the
				   rest of the congregation lift up a lamentable and bitter cry over him!
				   But, alas! instead of one, how many is it likely will remember this
				   discourse in hell? And it would be a wonder, if some that are now
				   present should not be in hell in a very short time, even before this
				   year is out. And it would be no wonder if some persons, that now sit
				   here, in some seats of this meeting-house, in health, quiet and secure,
				   should be there before tomorrow morning. Those of you that finally
				   continue in a natural condition, that shall keep out of hell longest
				   will be there in a little time! your damnation does not slumber; it
				   will come swiftly, and, in all probability, very suddenly upon many of
				   you. You have reason to wonder that you are not already in hell. It is
				   doubtless the case of some whom you have seen and known, that never
				   deserved hell more than you, and that heretofore appeared as likely to
				   have been now alive as you. Their case is past all hope; they are
				   crying in extreme misery and perfect despair; but here you are in the
				   land of the living and in the house of God, and have an opportunity to
				   obtain salvation. What would not those poor damned hopeless souls give
				   for one day's opportunity such as you now enjoy!
				</p><p>
				   And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has
				   thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and crying
				   with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to
				   him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily coming from
				   the east, west, north and south; many that were very lately in the same
				   miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with
				   their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them, and washed
				   them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the
				   glory of God. How awful is it to be left behind at such a day! To see
				   so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see so
				   many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to
				   mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit! How can you
				   rest one moment in such a condition? Are not your souls as precious as
				   the souls of the people at Suffield, where they are flocking from day
				   to day to Christ?
				</p><p>
				   Are there not many here who have lived long in the world, and are not
				   to this day born again? and so are aliens from the commonwealth of
				   Israel, and have done nothing ever since they have lived, but treasure
				   up wrath against the day of wrath? Oh, sirs, your case, in an especial
				   manner, is extremely dangerous. Your guilt and hardness of heart is
				   extremely great. Do you not see how generality persons of your years
				   are passed over and left, in the present remarkable and wonderful
				   dispensation of God's mercy? You had need to consider yourselves, and
				   awake thoroughly out of sleep. You cannot bear the fierceness and wrath
				   of the infinite God. - And you, young men, and young women, will you
				   neglect this precious season which you now enjoy, when so many others
				   of your age are renouncing all youthful vanities, and flocking to
				   Christ? You especially have now an extraordinary opportunity; but if
				   you neglect it, it will soon be with you as with those persons who
				   spent all the precious days of youth in sin, and are now come to such a
				   dreadful pass in blindness and hardness. - And you, children, who are
				   unconverted, do not you know that you are going down to hell, to bear
				   the dreadful wrath of that God, who is now angry with you every day and
				   every night? Will you be content to be the children of the devil, when
				   so many other children in the land are converted, and are become the
				   holy and happy children of the King of kings?
				</p><p>
				   And let every one that is yet out of Christ, and hanging over the pit
				   of hell, whether they be old men and women, or middle aged, or young
				   people, or little children, now hearken to the loud calls of God's word
				   and providence. This acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great
				   favour to some, will doubtless be a day of as remarkable vengeance to
				   others. Men's hearts harden, and their guilt increases apace at such a
				   day as this, if they neglect their souls; and never was there so great
				   danger of such persons being given up to hardness of heart and
				   blindness of mind. God seems now to be hastily gathering in his elect
				   in all parts of the land; and probably the greater part of adult
				   persons that ever shall be saved, will be brought in now in a little
				   time, and that it will be as it was on the great out-pouring of the
				   Spirit upon the Jews in the apostles' days; the election will obtain,
				   and the rest will be blinded. If this should be the case with you, you
				   will eternally curse this day, and will curse the day that ever you was
				   born, to see such a season of the pouring out of God's Spirit, and will
				   wish that you had died and gone to hell before you had seen it. Now
				   undoubtedly it is, as it was in the days of John the Baptist, the axe
				   is in an extraordinary manner laid at the root of the trees, that every
				   tree which brings not forth good fruit, may be hewn down and cast into
				   the fire.
				</p><p>
				   Therefore, let every one that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from
				   the wrath to come. The wrath of Almighty God is now undoubtedly hanging
				   over a great part of this congregation. Let every one fly out of Sodom:
				   "Haste and escape for your lives, look not behind you, escape to the
				   mountain, lest you be consumed."

				Preached at Northampton, and published at the desire of some of the hearers, in the year 1734.
				</p><p>
				    And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but
   					my Father which is in heaven. <reference osisRef="Matt.16.17">Matthew 16:17</reference>
				</p><p>
				   CHRIST says these words to Peter upon occasion of his professing his
				   faith in him as the Son of God. Our Lord was inquiring of his
				   disciples, who men said he was; not that he needed to be informed, but
				   only to introduce and give occasion to what follows. They answer, that
				   some said he was John the Baptist, and some Elias, and others Jeremias,
				   or one of the Prophets. When they had thus given an account who others
				   said he was, Christ asks them, who they said he was? Simon Peter, whom
				   we find always zealous and forward, was the first to answer: he readily
				   replied to the question, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.
				</p><p>
				   Upon this occasion, Christ says as he does to him, and of him in the
				   text: in which we may observe,
				</p><p>
				   1. That Peter is pronounced blessed on this account. Blessed art thou
				   - "Thou art a happy man, that thou art not ignorant of this, that I am
				   Christ, the Son of the living God. Thou art distinguishingly happy.
				   Others are blinded, and have dark and deluded apprehensions, as you
				   have now given an account, some thinking that I am Elias, and some that
				   I am Jeremias, and some one thing, and some another; but none of them
				   thinking right, all of them misled. Happy art thou, that art so
				   distinguished as to know the truth in this matter."
				</p><p>
				   2. The evidence of
				   this his happiness declared; viz., that God, and he only, had revealed
				   it to him. This is an evidence of his being blessed.
				</p><p>
				   First, As it shows how peculiarly favored he was of God above others;
				   q.d., "How highly favored art thou, that others that are wise and great
				   men, the Scribes, Pharisees, and Rulers, and the nation in general, are
				   left in darkness, to follow their own misguided apprehensions; and that
				   thou shouldst be singled out, as it were, by name, that my Heavenly
				   Father should thus set his love, on thee, Simon Bar-jona. This argues
				   thee blessed, that thou shouldst thus be the object of God's
				   distinguishing love."
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, It evidences his blessedness also, as it intimates that this
				   knowledge is above any that flesh and blood can reveal. "This is such
				   knowledge as only my Father which is in heaven can give: it is too high
				   and excellent to be communicated by such means as other knowledge is.
				   Thou art blessed, that thou knowest that which God alone can teach
				   thee."
				</p><p>
				   The original of this knowledge is here declared, both negatively and
				   positively. Positively, as God is here declared the author of it.
				   Negatively, as it is declared, that flesh and blood had not revealed
				   it. God is the author of all knowledge and understanding whatsoever. He
				   is the author of the knowledge that is obtained by human learning: he
				   is the author of all moral prudence, and of the knowledge and skill
				   that men have in their secular business. Thus it is said of all in
				   Israel that were wise-hearted, and skilled in embroidering, that God
				   had filled them with the spirit of wisdom, <reference osisRef="Exod.28.3">Exodus 28:3</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   God is the author of such knowledge; but yet not so but that flesh and
				   blood reveals it. Mortal men are capable of imparting the knowledge of
				   human arts and sciences, and skill in temporal affairs. God is the
				   author of such knowledge by those means: flesh and blood is employed as
				   the mediate or second cause of it; he conveys it by the power and
				   influence of natural means. But this spiritual knowledge, spoken of in
				   the text, is what God is the author of, and none else: he reveals it,
				   and flesh and blood reveals it not. He imparts this knowledge
				   immediately, not making use of any intermediate natural causes, as he
				   does in other knowledge.
				</p><p>
				   What had passed in the preceding discourse naturally occasioned Christ
				   to observe this; because the disciples had been telling how others did
				   not know him, but were generally mistaken about him, and divided and
				   confounded in their opinions of him: but Peter had declared his assured
				   faith, that he was the Son of God. Now it was natural to observe, how
				   it was not flesh and blood that had revealed it to him, but God: for if
				   this knowledge were dependent on natural causes or means, how came it
				   to pass that they, a company of poor fishermen, illiterate men, and
				   persons of low education, attained to the knowledge of the truth; while
				   the Scribes and Pharisees, men of vastly higher advantages, and greater
				   knowledge and sagacity in other matters, remained in ignorance? This
				   could be owing only to the gracious distinguishing influence and
				   revelation of the Spirit of God. Hence, what I would make the subject
				   of my present discourse from these words, is this
				</p><p>
					<hi type="bold">DOCTRINE</hi>
				</p><p>
				   That there is such a thing as a spiritual and divine light immediately
				   imparted to the soul by God, of a different nature from any that is
				   obtained by natural means.-And on this subject I would,
				</p><p>
				   I. Show what this divine light is.
				</p><p>
				   II. How it is given immediately by God, and not obtained by natural
				   means.
				</p><p>
				   III. Show the truth of the doctrine.
				</p><p>
				   And then conclude with a brief improvement.
				</p><p>
				   I. I would show what this spiritual and divine light is. And in order
				   to it, would show,
				</p><p>
				   First, In a few things what it is not. And here,
				</p><p>
				   1. Those convictions that natural men may have of their sin and misery,
				   is not this spiritual and divine light. Men in a natural condition may
				   have convictions of the guilt that lies upon them, and of the anger of
				   God, and their danger of divine vengeance. Such convictions are from
				   light or sensibleness of truth. That some sinners have a greater
				   conviction of their guilt and misery than others, is because some have
				   more light, or more of an apprehension of truth than others. And this
				   light and conviction may be from the Spirit of God; the Spirit
				   convinces men of sin: but yet nature is much more concerned in it than
				   in the communication of that spiritual and divine light that is spoken
				   of in the doctrine; it is from the Spirit of God only as assisting
				   natural principles, and not as infusing any new principles. Common
				   grace differs from special, in that it influences only by assisting of
				   nature; and not by imparting grace, or bestowing any thing above
				   nature. The light that is obtained is wholly natural, or of no superior
				   kind to what mere nature attains to, though more of that kind be
				   obtained than would be obtained if men were left wholly to themselves:
				   or, in other words, common grace only assists the faculties of the soul
				   to do that more fully which they do by nature, as natural conscience or
				   reason will, by mere nature, make a man sensible of guilt, and will
				   accuse and condemn him when he has done amiss. Conscience is a
				   principle natural to men; and the work that it doth naturally, or of
				   itself, is to give an apprehension of right and wrong, and to suggest
				   to the mind the relation that there is between right and wrong, and a
				   retribution. The Spirit of God, in those convictions which unregenerate
				   men sometimes have, assists conscience to do this work in a further
				   degree than it would do if they were left to themselves: he helps it
				   against those things that tend to stupify it, and obstruct its
				   exercise. But in the renewing and sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost,
				   those things are wrought in the soul that are above nature, and of
				   which there is nothing of the like kind in the soul by nature; and they
				   are caused to exist in the soul habitually, and according to such a
				   stated constitution or law that lays such a foundation for exercises in
				   a continued course, as is called a principle of nature. Not only are
				   remaining principles assisted to do their work more freely and fully,
				   but those principles are restored that were utterly destroyed by the
				   fall; and the mind thence forward habitually exerts those acts that the
				   dominion of sin had made it as wholly destitute of, as a dead body is
				   of vital acts.
				</p><p>
				   The Spirit of God acts in a very different manner in the one case, from
				   what he doth in the other. He may indeed act upon the mind of a natural
				   man, but he acts in the mind of a saint as an indwelling vital
				   principle. He acts upon the mind of an unregenerate person as an
				   extrinsic, occasional agent; for in acting upon them, he doth not unite
				   himself to them; for notwithstanding all his influences that they may
				   be the subjects of, they are still sensual, having not the Spirit, Jude
				   19. But he unites himself with the mind of a saint, takes him for his
				   temple, actuates and influences him as a new supernatural principle of
				   life and action. There is this difference, that the Spirit of God, in
				   acting in the soul of a godly man, exerts and communicates himself
				   there in his own proper nature. Holiness is the proper nature of the
				   Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit operates in the minds of the godly, by
				   uniting himself to them, and living in them, and exerting his own
				   nature in the exercise of their faculties. The Spirit of God may act
				   upon a creature, and yet not in acting communicate himself. The Spirit
				   of God may act upon inanimate creatures; as, the Spirit moved upon the
				   face of the waters, in the beginning of the creation; so the Spirit of
				   God may act upon the minds of men many ways, and communicate himself no
				   more than when he acts upon an inanimate creature. For instance, he may
				   excite thoughts in them, may assist their natural reason and
				   understanding, or may assist other natural principles, and this without
				   any union with the soul, but may act, as it were, as upon an external
				   object. But as he acts in his holy influences and spiritual operations,
				   he acts in a way of peculiar communication of himself; so that the
				   subject is thence denominated spiritual.
				</p><p>
				   2. This spiritual and divine light does not consist in any impression
				   made upon the imagination. It is no impression upon the mind, as though
				   one saw any thing with the bodily eyes: it is no imagination or idea of
				   an outward light or glory, or any beauty of form or countenance, or a
				   visible lustre or brightness of any object. The imagination may be
				   strongly impressed with such things; but this is not spiritual light.
				   Indeed when the mind has a lively discovery of spiritual things, and is
				   greatly affected by the power of divine light, it may, and probably
				   very commonly doth, much affect the imagination; so that impressions of
				   an outward beauty or brightness may accompany those spiritual
				   discoveries. But spiritual light is not that impression upon the
				   imagination, but an exceeding different thing from it. Natural men may
				   have lively impressions on their imaginations; and we cannot determine
				   but the devil, who transforms himself into an angel of light, may cause
				   imaginations of an outward beauty, or visible glory, and of sounds and
				   speeches, and other such things; but these are things of a vastly
				   inferior nature to spiritual light.
				</p><p>
				   3. This spiritual light is not the suggesting of any new truths or
				   propositions not contained in the word of God. This suggesting of new
				   truths or doctrines to the mind, independent of any antecedent
				   revelation of those propositions, either in word or writing, is
				   inspiration; such as the prophets and apostles had, and such as some
				   enthusiasts pretend to. But this spiritual light that I am speaking of,
				   is quite a different thing from inspiration: it reveals no new
				   doctrine, it suggests no new proposition to the mind, it teaches no new
				   thing of God, or Christ, or another world, not taught in the Bible, but
				   only gives a due apprehension of those things that are taught in the
				   word of God.
				</p><p>
				   4. It is not every affecting view that men have of the things of
				   religion that is this spiritual and divine light. Men by mere
				   principles of nature are capable of being affected with things that
				   have a special relation to religion as well as other things. A person
				   by mere nature, for instance, may be liable to be affected with the
				   story of Jesus Christ, and the sufferings he underwent, as well as by
				   any other tragical story: he may be the more affected with it from the
				   interest he conceives mankind to have in it: yea, he may be affected
				   with it without believing it; as well as a man may be affected with
				   what he reads in a romance, or sees acted in a stage play. He may be
				   affected with a lively and eloquent description of many pleasant things
				   that attend the state of the blessed in heaven, as well as his
				   imagination be entertained by a romantic description of the
				   pleasantness of fairy land, or the like. And that common belief of the
				   truth of the things of religion, that persons may have from education
				   or otherwise, may help forward their affection. We read in Scripture of
				   many that were greatly affected with things of a religious nature, who
				   yet are there represented as wholly graceless, and many of them very
				   ill men. A person therefore may have affecting views of the things of
				   religion, and yet be very destitute of spiritual light. Flesh and blood
				   may be the author of this: one man may give another an affecting view
				   of divine things with but common assistance: but God alone can give a
				   spiritual discovery of them. - But I proceed to show,
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, Positively what this spiritual and divine light is.
				</p><p>
				   And it may be thus described: a true sense of the divine excellency of
				   the things revealed in the word of God, and a conviction of the truth
				   and reality of them thence arising. This spiritual light primarily
				   consists in the former of these, viz., a real sense and apprehension of
				   the divine excellency of things revealed in the word of God. A
				   spiritual and saving conviction of the truth and reality of these
				   things, arises from such a sight of their divine excellency and glory;
				   so that this conviction of their truth is an effect and natural
				   consequence of this sight of their divine glory. There is therefore in
				   this spiritual light,
				</p><p>
				   1. A true sense of the divine and superlative excellency of the things
				   of religion; a real sense of the excellency of God and Jesus Christ,
				   and of the work of redemption, and the ways and works of God revealed
				   in the gospel. There is a divine and superlative glory in these things;
				   an excellency that is of a vastly higher kind, and more sublime nature
				   than in other things; a glory greatly distinguishing them from all that
				   is earthly and temporal. He that is spiritually enlightened truly
				   apprehends and sees it, or has a sense of it. He does not merely
				   rationally believe that God is glorious, but he has a sense of the
				   gloriousness of God in his heart. There is not only a rational belief
				   that God is holy, and that holiness is a good thing, but there is a
				   sense of the loveliness of God's holiness. There is not only a
				   speculatively judging that God is gracious, but a sense how amiable God
				   is upon that account, or a sense of the beauty of this divine
				   attribute.
				</p><p>
				   There is a twofold understanding or knowledge of good that God has made
				   the mind of man capable of. The first, that which is merely speculative
				   and notional; as when a person only speculatively judges that any thing
				   is, which, by the agreement of mankind, is called good or excellent,
				   viz., that which is most to general advantage, and between which and a
				   reward there is a suitableness, and the like. And the other is, that
				   which consists in the sense of the heart: as when there is a sense of
				   the beauty, amiableness, or sweetness of a thing; so that the heart is
				   sensible of pleasure and delight in the presence of the idea of it. In
				   the former is exercised merely the speculative faculty, or the
				   understanding, strictly so called, or as spoken of in distinction from
				   the will or disposition of the soul. In the latter, the will, or
				   inclination, or heart, are mainly concerned.
				</p><p>
				   Thus there is a difference between having an opinion, that God is holy
				   and gracious, and having a sense of the loveliness and beauty of that
				   holiness and grace. There is a difference between having a rational
				   judgment that honey is sweet, and having a sense of its sweetness. A
				   man may have the former, that knows not how honey tastes; but a man
				   cannot have the latter unless he has an idea of the taste of honey in
				   his mind. So there is a difference between believing that a person is
				   beautiful, and having a sense of his beauty. The former may be obtained
				   by hearsay, but the latter only by seeing the countenance. There is a
				   wide difference between mere speculative rational judging any thing to
				   be excellent, and having a sense of its sweetness and beauty. The
				   former rests only in the head, speculation only is concerned in it; but
				   the heart is concerned in the latter. When the heart is sensible of the
				   beauty and amiableness of a thing, it necessarily feels pleasure in the
				   apprehension. It is implied in a person's being heartily sensible of
				   the loveliness of a thing, that the idea of it is sweet and pleasant to
				   his soul; which is a far different thing from having a rational opinion
				   that it is excellent.
				</p><p>
				   2. There arises from this sense of divine excellency of things
				   contained in the word of God, a conviction of the truth and reality of
				   them; and that either directly or indirectly.
				</p><p>
				   First, Indirectly, and that two ways.
				</p><p>
				   1. As the prejudices that are in the heart, against the truth of divine
				   things, are hereby removed; so that the mind becomes susceptive of the
				   due force of rational arguments for their truth. The mind of man is
				   naturally full of prejudices against the truth of divine things: it is
				   full of enmity against the doctrines of the gospel; which is a
				   disadvantage to those arguments that prove their truth, and causes them
				   to lose their force upon the mind. But when a person has discovered to
				   him the divine excellency of Christian doctrines, this destroys the
				   enmity, removes those prejudices, and sanctifies the reason, and causes
				   it to lie open to the force of arguments for their truth.
				</p><p>
				   Hence was the different effect that Christ's miracles had to convince
				   the disciples from what they had to convince the Scribes and Pharisees.
				   Not that they had a stronger reason, or had their reason more improved;
				   but their reason was sanctified, and those blinding prejudices, that
				   the Scribes and Pharisees were under, were removed by the sense they
				   had of the excellency of Christ and his doctrine.
				</p><p>
				   2. It not only removes the hinderances of reason, but positively helps
				   reason. It makes even the speculative notions the more lively. It
				   engages the attention of the mind, with the fixedness and intenseness
				   to that kind of objects; which causes it to have a clearer view of
				   them, and enables it more clearly to see their mutual relations, and
				   occasions it to take more notice of them. The ideas themselves that
				   otherwise are dim and obscure, are by this means impressed with the
				   greater strength, and have a light cast upon them; so that the mind can
				   better judge of them. As he that beholds the objects on the face of the
				   earth, when the light of the sun is cast upon them; so that the mind
				   can better judge of them. As he that beholds the objects on the face of
				   the earth, when the light of the sun is cast upon them, is under
				   greater advantage to discern them in their true forms and mutual
				   relations, than he that sees them in a dim starlight or twilight.
				</p><p>
				   The mind having a sensibleness of the excellency of divine objects,
				   dwells upon them with delight; and the powers of the soul are more
				   awakened and enlivened to employ themselves in the contemplation of
				   them, and exert themselves more fully and much more to the purpose. The
				   beauty and sweetness of the objects draws on the faculties, and draws
				   forth their exercises: so that reason itself is under far greater
				   advantages for its proper and free exercises, and to attain its proper
				   end, free of darkness and delusion. - But,
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, A true sense of the divine excellency of the things of God's
				   word doth more directly and immediately convince of the truth of them;
				   and that because the excellency of these things is so superlative.
				   There is a beauty in them that is so divine and godlike, that is
				   greatly and evidently distinguishing of them from things merely human,
				   or that men are the inventors and authors of; a glory that is so high
				   and great, that when clearly seen, commands assent to their divinity
				   and reality. When there is an actual and lively discovery of this
				   beauty and excellency, it will not allow of any such thought as that it
				   is a human work, or the fruit of men's invention. This evidence that
				   they that are spiritually enlightened have of the truth of the things
				   of religion, is a kind of intuitive and immediate evidence. They
				   believe the doctrines of God's word to be divine, because they see
				   divinity in them; i.e., they see a divine, and transcendent, and most
				   evidently distinguishing glory in them; such a glory as, if clearly
				   seen, does not leave room to doubt of their being of God, and not of
				   men.
				</p><p>
				   Such a conviction of the truth of religion as this, arising, these
				   ways, from a sense of the divine excellency of them, is that true
				   spiritual conviction that there is in saving faith. And this original
				   of it, is that by which it is most essentially distinguished from that
				   common assent, which unregenerate men are capable of.
				</p><p>
				   II. I proceed now to the second thing proposed, viz., to show how this
				   light is immediately given by God, and not obtained by natural means.
				   And here,
				</p><p>
				   1. It is not intended that the natural faculties are not made use of in
				   it. The natural faculties are the subject of this light: and they are
				   the subject in such a manner, that they are not merely passive, but
				   active in it; the acts and exercises of man's understanding are
				   concemed and made use of in it. God, in letting in this light into the
				   soul, deals with man according to his nature, or as a rational
				   creature; and makes use of his human faculties. But yet this light is
				   not the less immediately from God for that; though the faculties are
				   made use of, it is as the subject and not as the cause; and that acting
				   of the faculties in it, is not the cause, but is either implied in the
				   thing itself (in the light that is imparted) or is the consequence of
				   it. As the use that we make of our eyes in beholding various objects,
				   when the sun arises, is not the cause of the light that discovers those
				   objects to us.
				</p><p>
				   2. It is not intended that outward means have no concern in this
				   affair. As I have observed already, it is not in this affair, as it is
				   in inspiration, where new truths are suggested: for here is by this
				   light only given a due apprehension of the same truths that are
				   revealed in the word of God; and therefore it is not given without the
				   word. The gospel is made use of in this affair: this light is the
				   "light of the glorious gospel of Christ", <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:4</reference>. The gospel is as
				   a glass by which this light is conveyed to us, <reference osisRef="1Cor.13.12">1 Corinthians 13:12</reference>. "Now we
				   see through a glass." - But,
				</p><p>
				   3. When it is said that this light is given immediately by God, and not
				   obtained by natural means, hereby is intended, that it is given by God
				   without making use of any means that operate by their own power, or a
				   natural force God makes use of means; but it is not as mediate causes
				   to produce this effect. There are not truly any second causes of it;
				   but it is produced by God immediately. The word of God is no proper
				   cause of this effect: it does not operate by any natural force in it.
				   The word of God is only made use of to convey to the mind the subject
				   matter of this saving instruction: and this indeed it doth convey to us
				   by natural force or influence. It conveys to our minds these and those
				   doctrines; it is the cause of the notion of them in our heads, but not
				   of the sense of the divine excellency of them in our hearts. Indeed a
				   person cannot have spiritual light without the word. But that does not
				   argue, that the word properly causes that light. The mind cannot see
				   the excellency of any doctrine, unless that doctrine be first in the
				   mind; but the seeing of the excellency of the doctrine may be
				   immediately from the Spirit of God; though the conveying of the
				   doctrine or proposition itself may be by the word. So that the notions
				   that are the subject matter of this light, are conveyed to the mind by
				   the word of God; but that due sense of the heart, wherein this light
				   formally consists, is immediately by the Spirit of God. As for
				   instance, that notion that there is a Christ, and that Christ is holy
				   and gracious, is conveyed to the mind by the word of God: but the sense
				   of the excellency of Christ by reason of that holiness and grace, is
				   nevertheless immediately the work of the Holy Spirit. - I come now,
				</p><p>
				   III. To show the truth of the doctrine; that is, to show that there is
				   such a thing as that spiritual light that has been described, thus
				   immediately let into the mind by God. And here I would show briefly,
				   that this doctrine is both scriptural and rational.
				</p><p>
				   First, It is scriptural. My text is not only full to the purpose, but
				   it is a doctrine that the Scripture abounds in. We are there abundantly
				   taught, that the saints differ from the ungodly in this, that they have
				   the knowledge of God, and a sight of God, and of Jesus Christ. I shall
				   mention but few texts of many. <reference osisRef="1John.3.6">1 John 3:6</reference>, "Whosoever sinneth, has not
				   seen him, nor known him." 3 John 11, "He that doth good, is of God: but
				   he that doth evil, hath not seen God." <reference osisRef="John.14.19">John 14:19</reference>, "The world seeth me
				   no more; but ye see me." <reference osisRef="John.17.3">John 17:3</reference>, "And this is eternal life, that
				   they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
				   hast sent." This knowledge, or sight of God and Christ, cannot be a
				   mere speculative knowledge; because it is spoken of as a seeing and
				   knowing, wherein they differ from the ungodly. And by these Scriptures
				   it must not only be a different knowledge in degree and circumstances,
				   and different in its effects; but it must be entirely different in
				   nature and kind.
				</p><p>
				   And this light and knowledge is always spoken of as immediately given
				   of God, <reference osisRef="Matt.11.25 Matt.11.26 Matt.11.27">Matthew 11:25-27</reference>: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank
				   thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
				   things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
				   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are
				   delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son but the
				   Father: neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to
				   whomsoever the Son will reveal him." Here this effect is ascribed alone
				   to the arbitrary operation, and gift of God, bestowing this knowledge
				   on whom he will, and distinguishing those with it, that have the least
				   natural advantage or means for knowledge, even babes, when it is denied
				   to the wise and prudent. And the imparting of the knowledge of God is
				   here appropriated to the Son of God, as his sole prerogative. And
				   again, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>, "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of
				   darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
				   of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ." This plainly shows,
				   that there is such a thing as a discovery of the divine superlative
				   glory and excellency of God and Christ, and that peculiar to the
				   saints: and also, that it is as immediately from God, as light from the
				   sun: and that it is the immediate effect of his power and will; for it
				   is compared to God's creating the light by his powerful word in the
				   beginning of the creation; and is said to be by the Spirit of the Lord,
				   in the 18th verse of the preceding chapter. God is spoken of as giving
				   the knowledge of Christ in conversion, as of what before was hidden and
				   unseen in that. <reference osisRef="Gal.1.15 Gal.1.16">Galatians 1:15-16</reference>, "But when it pleased God, who separated
				   me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son
				   in me." The Scripture also speaks plainly of such a knowledge of the
				   word of God, as has been described, as the immediate gift of God, <reference osisRef="Ps.119.18">Psalms 119:18</reference>: "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
				   thy law." What could the Psalmist mean when he begged of God to open
				   his eyes? Was he ever blind? Might he not have resort to the law and
				   see every word and sentence in it when he pleased? and what could he
				   mean by those wondrous things? Was it the wonderful stories of the
				   creation, and deluge, and Israel's passing through the Red Sea, and the
				   like? Were not his eyes open to read these strange things when he
				   would? Doubtless by wondrous things in God's law, he had respect to
				   those distinguishing and wonderful excellencies, and marvellous
				   manifestations of the divine perfections, and glory, that there was in
				   the commands and doctrines of the word, and those works and counsels of
				   God that were there revealed. So the Scripture speaks of a knowledge of
				   God's dispensation, and covenant of mercy, and way of grace towards his
				   people, as peculiar to the saints, and given only by God, <reference osisRef="Ps.25.14">Psalms 25:14</reference>:
				   "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show
				   them his covenant."
				</p><p>
				   And that a true and saving belief of the truth of religion is that
				   which arises from such a discovery, is also what the Scripture teaches.
				   As <reference osisRef="John.6.40">John 6:40</reference>, "And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one
				   which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life;"
				   where it is plain that a true faith is what arises from a spiritual
				   sight of Christ. and <reference osisRef="John.17.6 John.17.7 John.17.8">John 17:6-8</reference>, "I have manifested thy name unto
				   the men which thou gavest me out of the world. Now they have known that
				   all things whatsoever thou hast given me, are of thee. For I have given
				   unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them,
				   and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed
				   that thou didst send me;" where Christ's manifesting God's name to the
				   disciples, or giving them the knowledge of God, was that whereby they
				   knew that Christ's doctrine was of God, and that Christ himself was of
				   him, proceeded from him, and was sent by him. Again, <reference osisRef="John.12.44 John.12.45 John.12.46">John 12:44-46</reference>,
				   "Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,
				   but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
				   I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me,
				   should not abide in darkness." Their believing in Christ, and
				   spiritually seeing him, are spoken of as running parallel.
				</p><p>
				   Christ condemns the Jews that they did not know that he was the
				   Messiah, and that his doctrine was true, from an inward distinguishing
				   taste and relish of what was divine, in <reference osisRef="Luke.12.56 Luke.12.57">Luke 12:56-57</reference>. He having there
				   blamed the Jews, that though they could discern the face of the sky and
				   of the earth, and signs of the weather, that yet they could not discern
				   those times; or as it is expressed in Matthew, the signs of those
				   times; he adds, yea, and why even of your own selves, judge ye not what
				   is right? i.e., without extrinsic signs. Why have ye not that sense of
				   true excellency, whereby ye may distinguish that which is holy and
				   divine? Why have ye not that savor of the things of God, by which you
				   may see the distinguishing glory, and evident divinity of me and my
				   doctrine?
				</p><p>
				   The Apostle Peter mentions it as what gave them (the apostles) good and
				   well grounded assurance of the truth of the gospel, that they had seen
				   the divine glory of Christ. <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.16">2 Peter 1:16</reference>, "For we have not followed
				   cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and
				   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
				   The apostle has respect to that visible glory of Christ which they saw
				   in his transfiguration: that glory was so divine, having such an
				   ineffable appearance and semblance of divine holiness, majesty and
				   grace, that it evidently denoted him to be a divine person. But if a
				   sight of Christ's outward glory might give a rational assurance of his
				   divinity, why may not an apprehension of his spiritual glory do so too?
				   Doubtless Christ's spiritual glory is in itself as distinguishing, and
				   as plainly showing his divinity, as his outward glory, and a great deal
				   more: for his spiritual glory is that wherein his divinity consists;
				   and the outward glory of his transfiguration showed him to be divine,
				   only as it was a remarkable image or representation of that spiritual
				   glory. Doubtless, therefore, he that has had a clear sight of the
				   spiritual glory of Christ, may say, I have not followed cunningly
				   devised fables, but have been an eyewitness of his majesty, upon as
				   good grounds as the apostle, when he had respect to the outward glory
				   of Christ that he had seen. - But this brings me to what was proposed
				   next, viz., to show that,
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, This doctrine is rational.
				</p><p>
				   1. It is rational to suppose, that there is really such an excellency
				   in divine things, that is so transcendent and exceedingly different
				   from what is in other things, that, if it were seen, would most
				   evidently distinguish them. We cannot rationally doubt but that things
				   that are divine, that appertain to the Supreme Being, are vastly
				   different from things that are human; that there is that godlike, high
				   and glorious excellency in them, that does most remarkably difference
				   them from the things that are of men; insomuch that if the difference
				   were but seen, it would have a convincing, satisfying influence upon
				   any one, that they are what they are, viz., divine. What reason can be
				   offered against it? Unless we would argue, that God is not remarkably
				   distinguished in glory from men.
				</p><p>
				   If Christ should now appear to any one as he did on the mount at his
				   transfiguration; or if he should appear to the world in the glory that
				   he now appears in, as he will do at the day of judgment; without doubt,
				   the glory and majesty that he would appear in, would be such as would
				   satisfy every one that he was a divine person, and that religion was
				   true: and it would be a most reasonable, and well grounded conviction
				   too. And why may there not be that stamp of divinity, or divine glory
				   on the word of God, on the scheme and doctrine of the gospel, that may
				   be in like manner distinguishing and as rationally convincing, provided
				   it be but seen? It is rational to suppose, that when God speaks to the
				   world, there should be something in his word or speech vastly different
				   from man's word. Supposing that God never had spoken to the world, but
				   we had noticed that he was about to do it; that he was about to reveal
				   himself from heaven, and speak to us immediately himself, in divine
				   speeches or discourses, as it were from his own mouth, or that he
				   should give us a book of his own inditing; after what manner should we
				   expect that he would speak? Would it not be rational to suppose, that
				   his speech would be exceeding different from man's speech, that he
				   should speak like a God; that is, that there should be such an
				   excellency and sublimity in his speech or word, such a stamp of wisdom,
				   holiness, majesty and other divine perfections, that the word of man,
				   yea of the wisest of men, should appear mean and base in comparison of
				   it? Doubtless it would be thought rational to expect this, and
				   unreasonable to think otherwise. When a wise man speaks in the exercise
				   of his wisdom, there is something in every thing he says, that is very
				   distinguishable from the talk of a little child. So, without doubt, and
				   much more, is the speech of God (if there be any such thing as the
				   speech of God) to be distinguished from that of the wisest of men;
				   agreeably to <reference osisRef="Jer.23.28 Jer.23.29">Jeremiah 23:28-29</reference>. God having there been reproving the false
				   prophets that prophesied in his name, and pretended that what they
				   spake was his word, when indeed it was their own word, says, "The
				   prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my
				   word, let him speak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat?
				   saith the Lord. Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like
				   a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?"
				</p><p>
				   2. If there be such a distinguishing excellency in divine things; it is
				   rational to suppose that there may be such a thing as seeing it. What
				   should hinder but that it may be seen? It is no argument, that there is
				   no such thing as such a distinguishing excellency, or that, if there
				   be, that it cannot be seen, that some do not see it, though they may be
				   discerning men in temporal matters. It is not rational to suppose, if
				   there be any such excellency in divine things, that wicked men should
				   see it. It is not rational to suppose, that those whose minds are full
				   of spiritual pollution, and under the power of filthy lusts, should
				   have any relish or sense of divine beauty or excellency; or that their
				   minds should be susceptive of that light that is in its own nature so
				   pure and heavenly. It need not seem at all strange, that sin should so
				   blind the mind, seeing that men's particular natural tempers and
				   dispositions will so much blind them in secular matters; as when men's
				   natural temper is melancholy, jealous, fearful, proud, or the like.
				</p><p>
				   3. It is rational to suppose, that this knowledge should be given
				   immediately by God, and not be obtained by natural means. Upon what
				   account should it seem unreasonable, that there should be any immediate
				   communication between God and the creature? It is strange that men
				   should make any matter of difficulty of it. Why should not he that made
				   all things, still have something immediately to do with the things that
				   he has made? Where lies the great difficulty, if we own the being of a
				   God, and that he created all things out of nothing, of allowing some
				   immediate influence of God on the creation still? And if it be
				   reasonable to suppose it with respect to any part of the creation, it
				   is especially so with respect to reasonable, intelligent creatures; who
				   are next to God in the gradation of the different orders of beings, and
				   whose business is most immediately with God; who were made on purpose
				   for those exercises that do respect God and wherein they have nextly to
				   do with God: for reason teaches, that man was made to serve and glorify
				   his Creator. And if it be rational to suppose that God immediately
				   communicates himself to man in any affair, it is in this. It is
				   rational to suppose that God would reserve that knowledge and wisdom,
				   that is of such a divine and excellent nature, to be bestowed
				   immediately by himself, and that it should not be left in the power of
				   second causes. Spiritual wisdom and grace is that highest and most
				   excellent gift that ever God bestows on any creature: in this the
				   highest excellency and perfection of a rational creature consists. It
				   is also immensely the most important of all divine gifts: it is that
				   wherein man's happiness consists, and on which his everlasting welfare
				   depends. How rational is it to suppose that God, however he has left
				   meaner goods and lower gifts to second causes, and in some sort in
				   their power, yet should reserve this most excellent, divine, and
				   important of all divine communications, in his own hands, to be
				   bestowed immediately by himself, as a thing too great for second causes
				   to be concerned in!
				</p><p>
				   It is rational to suppose, that this blessing should be immediately
				   from God; for there is no gift or benefit that is in itself so nearly
				   related to the divine nature, there is nothing the creature receives
				   that is so much of God, of his nature, so much a participation of the
				   deity: it is a kind of emanation of God's beauty, and is related to God
				   as the light is to the sun. It is therefore congruous and fit, that
				   when it is given of God, it should be nextly from himself, and by
				   himself, according to his own sovereign will.
				</p><p>
				   It is rational to suppose, that it should be beyond a man's power to
				   obtain this knowledge and light by the mere strength of natural reason;
				   for it is not a thing that belongs to reason, to see the beauty and
				   loveliness of spiritual things; it is not a speculative thing, but
				   depends on the sense of the heart. Reason indeed is necessary in order
				   to it, as it is by reason only that we are become the subjects of the
				   means of it; which means I have already shown to be necessary in order
				   to it, though they have no proper causal in the affair. It is by reason
				   that we become possessed of a notion of those doctrines that are the
				   subject matter of this divine light; and reason may many ways be
				   indirectly and remotely an advantage to it. And reason has also to do
				   in the acts that are immediately consequent on this discovery: a seeing
				   the truth of religion from hence, is by reason; though it be but by one
				   step, and the inference be immediate. So reason has to do in that
				   accepting of, and trusting in Christ, that is consequent on it. But if
				   we take reason strictly - not for the faculty of mental perception in
				   general, but for ratiocination, or a power of inferring by arguments -
				   the perceiving of spiritual beauty and excellency no more belongs to
				   reason, than it belongs to the sense of feeling to perceive colours, or
				   to the power of seeing to perceive the sweetness of food. It is out of
				   reason's province to perceive the beauty or loveliness of any thing:
				   such a perception does not belong to that faculty. Reason's work is to
				   perceive truth and not excellency. It is not ratiocination that gives
				   men the perception of the beauty and amiableness of a countenance,
				   though it may be many ways indirectly an advantage to it; yet it is no
				   more reason that immediately perceives it, than it is reason that
				   perceives the sweetness of honey: it depends on the sense of the heart.
				   - Reason may determine that a countenance is beautiful to others, it
				   may determine that honey is sweet to others; but it will never give me
				   a perception of its sweetness.
				</p><p>
				   I will conclude with a very brief improvement of what has been said.
				</p><p>
				   First, This doctrine may lead us to reflect on the goodness of God,
				   that has so ordered it, that a saving evidence of the truth of the
				   gospel is such, as is attainable by persons of mean capacities and
				   advantages, as well as those that are of the greatest parts and
				   learning. If the evidence of the gospel depended only on history, and
				   such reasonings as learned men only are capable of, it would be above
				   the reach of far the greatest part of mankind. But persons with but an
				   ordinary degree of knowledge, are capable, without a long and subtile
				   train of reasoning, to see the divine excellency of the things of
				   religion: they are capable of being taught by the Spirit of God, as
				   well as learned men. The evidence that is this way obtained, is vastly
				   better and more satisfying, than all that can be obtained by the
				   arguings of those that are most learned, and greatest masters of
				   reason. And babes are as capable of knowing these things, as the wise
				   and prudent; and they are often hid from these things, as the wise and
				   prudent; and they are often hid from these when they are revealed to
				   those. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.26 1Cor.1.27">1 Corinthians 1:26-27</reference>, "For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not
				   many wise men, after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are
				   called. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world -."
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, This doctrine may well put us upon examining ourselves,
				   whether we have ever had this divine light, that has been described,
				   let into our souls. If there be such a thing indeed, and it be not only
				   a notion or whimsy of persons of weak and distempered brains, then
				   doubtless it is a thing of great importance, whether we have thus been
				   taught by the Spirit of God; whether the light of the glorious gospel
				   of Christ, who is the image of God, hath shined unto us, giving us the
				   light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ;
				   whether we have seen the Son, and believed on him, or have that faith
				   of gospel-doctrines which arises from a spiritual sight of Christ.
				</p><p>
				   Thirdly, All may hence be exhorted earnestly to seek this spiritual
				   light. To influence and move to it, the following things may be
				   considered.
				</p><p>
				   1. This is the most excellent and divine wisdom that any creature is
				   capable of. It is more excellent than any human learning; it is far
				   more excellent than all the knowledge of the greatest philosophers or
				   statesmen. Yea, the least glimpse of the glory of God in the face of
				   Christ doth more exalt and ennoble the soul, than all the knowledge of
				   those that have the greatest speculative understanding in divinity
				   without grace. This knowledge has the most noble object that is or can
				   be, viz., the divine glory or excellency of God and Christ. The
				   knowledge of these objects is that wherein consists the most excellent
				   knowledge of the angels, yea, of God himself.
				</p><p>
				   2. This knowledge is that which is above all others sweet and joyful.
				   Men have a great deal of pleasure in human knowledge, in studies of
				   natural things; but this is nothing to that joy which arises from this
				   divine light shining into the soul. This light gives a view of those
				   things that are immensely the most exquisitely beautiful, and capable
				   of delighting the eye of the understanding. This spiritual light is the
				   dawning of the light of glory in the heart. There is nothing so
				   powerful as this to support persons in affliction, and to give the mind
				   peace and brightness in this stormy and dark world.
				</p><p>
				   3. This light is such as effectually influences the inclination, and
				   changes the nature of the soul. It assimilates the nature to the divine
				   nature, and changes the soul into an image of the same glory that is
				   beheld. <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>, "But we all with open face, beholding as in a
				   glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from
				   glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." This knowledge will
				   wean from the world, and raise the inclination to heavenly things. It
				   will turn the heart to God as the fountain of good, and to choose him
				   for the only portion. This light, and this only, will bring the soul to
				   a saving close with Christ. It conforms the heart to the gospel,
				   mortifies its enmity and opposition against the scheme of salvation
				   therein revealed: it causes the heart to embrace the joyful tidings,
				   and entirely to adhere to, and acquiesce in the revelation of Christ as
				   our Saviour: it causes the whole soul to accord and symphonize with it,
				   admitting it with entire credit and respect cleaving to it with full
				   inclination and affection; and it effectually disposes the soul to give
				   up itself entirely to Christ.
				</p><p>
				   4. This light, and this only, has its fruit in a universal holiness of
				   life. No merely notional or speculative understanding of the doctrines
				   of religion will ever bring to this. But this light, as it reaches the
				   bottom of the heart, and changes the nature, so it will effectually
				   dispose to a universal obedience. It shows God's worthiness to be
				   obeyed and served. It draws forth the heart in a sincere love to God,
				   which is the only principle of a true, gracious, and universal
				   obedience; and it convinces of the reality of those glorious rewards
				   that God has promised to them that obey him.

				<title>Christ's Agony</title>
				<p>
					A Sermon<lb />
					  by<lb />
					Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
				  <reference osisRef="Luke.22.44">Luke 22:44</reference> - And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat
				  was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
				</p><p>
				   Our Lord Jesus Christ, in his original nature, was infinitely above all
				   suffering, for he was "God over all, blessed for evermore;" but, when
				   he became man, he was not only capable of suffering, but partook of
				   that nature that is remarkably feeble and exposed to suffering. The
				   human nature, on account of its weakness, is in Scripture compared to
				   the grass of the field, which easily withers and decays. So it is
				   compared to a leaf; and to the dry stubble; and to a blast of wind: and
				   the nature of feeble man is said to be but dust and ashes, to have its
				   foundation in the dust, and to be crushed before the moth. It was this
				   nature, with all its weakness and exposedness to sufferings, which
				   Christ, who is the Lord God omnipotent, took upon him. He did not take
				   the human nature on him in its first, most perfect and vigorous state,
				   but in that feeble forlorn state which it is in since the fall; and
				   therefore Christ is called "a tender plant," and "a root out of a dry
				   ground." <reference osisRef="Isa.53.2">Isaiah 53:2</reference>. "For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant,
				   and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
				   when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him."
				   Thus, as Christ's principal errand into the world was suffering, so,
				   agreeably to that errand, he came with such a nature and in such
				   circumstances, as most made way for his suffering; so his whole life
				   was filled up with suffering, he began to suffer in his infancy, but
				   his suffering increased the more he drew near to the close of his life.
				   His suffering after his public ministry began, was probably much
				   greater than before; and the latter part of the time of his public
				   ministry seems to have been distinguished by suffering. The longer
				   Christ lived in the world, the more men saw and heard of him, the more
				   they hated him. His enemies were more and more enraged by the
				   continuance of the opposition that he made to their lusts; and the
				   devil having been often baffled by him, grew more and more enraged, and
				   strengthened the battle more and more against him: so that the cloud
				   over Christ's head grew darker and darker, as long as he lived in the
				   world, till it was in its greatest blackness when he hung upon the
				   cross and cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me! Before
				   this, it was exceedingly dark, in the time of his agony in the garden;
				   of which we have an account in the words now read; and which I propose
				   to make the subject of my present discourse. The word agony properly
				   signifies an earnest strife, such as is witnessed in wrestling,
				   running, or fighting. And therefore in <reference osisRef="Luke.13.24">Luke 13:24</reference>. "Strive to enter in
				   at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in,
				   and shall not be able;" the word in the original, translated strive, is
				   agwnizesqe. "Agonize, to enter in at the strait gate." The word is
				   especially used for that sort of strife, which in those days was
				   exhibited in the Olympic games, in which men strove for the mastery in
				   running, wrestling, and other such kinds of exercises; and a prize was
				   set up that was bestowed on the conqueror. Those, who thus contended,
				   were, in the language then in use, said to agonize. Thus the apostle in
				   his epistle to the Christians of Corinth, a city of Greece, where such
				   games were annually exhibited, says in allusion to the strivings of the
				   combatants, "And every man that striveth for the mastery," in the
				   original, every one that agonizeth, "is temperate in all things." The
				   place where those games were held was called Agwn, or the place of
				   agony; and the word is particularly used in Scripture for that striving
				   in earnest prayer wherein persons wrestle with God:they are said to
				   agonize, or to be in agony, in prayer. So the word is used <reference osisRef="Rom.15.30">Romans 15:30</reference>.
				   "Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for
				   the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers
				   to God for me:" in the original sunagwnizesqai moi, that ye agonize
				   together with me. So <reference osisRef="Col.4.12">Colossians 4:12</reference>. "Always labouring fervently for you in
				   prayer, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God:"
				   in the original agwnizwn agonizing for you. So that when it is said in
				   the text that Christ was in an agony, the meaning is, that his soul was
				   in a great and earnest strife and conflict. It was so in two respects:
				</p><p>
				   1. As his soul was in a great and sore conflict with those terrible and
				   amazing views and apprehensions which he then had.
				</p><p>
				   2. As he was at the same time in great labour and earnest strife with
				   God in prayer.
				</p><p>
				   I propose therefore, in discoursing on the subject of Christ's agony,
				   distinctly to unfold it, under these two propositions,
				</p><p>
				   I. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a sore
				   conflict with those terrible and amazing views and apprehensions, of
				   which he was then the subject.
				</p><p>
				   II. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a great and
				   earnest labour and struggle with God in prayer.
				</p><p>
				   I. The soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a sore conflict
				   with those terrible amazing views and apprehensions, of which he was
				   then the subject.
				</p><p>
				   In illustrating this proposition I shall endeavour to show,
				</p><p>
				   1. What those views and apprehensions were.
				</p><p>
				   2. That the conflict or agony of Christ's soul was occasioned by those
				   views and apprehensions.
				</p><p>
				   3. That this conflict was peculiarly great and distressing; and,
				</p><p>
				   4. What we may suppose to be the special design of God in giving Christ
				   those terrible views and apprehensions, and causing him to suffer that
				   dreadful conflict, before he was crucified.
				</p><p>
				   I proposed to show,
				</p><p>
				   First, What were those terrible views and amazing apprehensions which
				   Christ had in his agony. This may be explained by considering,
				</p><p>
				   1. The cause of those views and apprehensions; and,
				</p><p>
				   2. The manner in which they were then experienced.
				</p><p>
				   1. The cause of those views and apprehensions, which Christ had in his
				   agony in the garden, was the bitter cup which he was soon after to
				   drink on the cross. The sufferings which Christ underwent in his agony
				   in the garden, were not his greatest sufferings; though they were so
				   very great. But his last sufferings upon the cross were his principal
				   sufferings; and therefore they are called "the cup that he had to
				   drink." The sufferings of the cross, under which he was slain, are
				   always in the Scriptures represented as the main sufferings of Christ;
				   those in which especially "he bare our sins in his own body," and made
				   atonement for sin. His enduring the cross, his humbling himself, and
				   becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, is spoken of
				   as the main thing wherein his sufferings appeared. This is the cup that
				   Christ had set before him in his agony. It is manifest that Christ had
				   this in view at this time, from the prayers which he then offered.
				   According to Matthew, Christ made three prayers that evening while in
				   the garden of Gethsemane, and all on this one subject, the bitter cup
				   that he was to drink. Of the first, we have an account in <reference osisRef="Matt.26.39">Matthew 26:39</reference>.
				   "And he went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying,
				   O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;
				   nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt:" of the second in the 42d
				   verse, "He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, O my
				   Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, thy will
				   be done:" and of the third in the 44th verse, "And he left them, and
				   went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
				   From this it plainly appears what it was of which Christ had such
				   terrible views and apprehensions at that time. What he thus insists on
				   in his prayers, shows on what his mind was so deeply intent. It was his
				   sufferings on the cross, which were to be endured the next day, when
				   there should be darkness over all the earth, and at the same time a
				   deeper darkness over the soul of Christ, of which he had now such
				   lively views and distressing apprehensions.
				</p><p>
				   2. The manner in which this bitter cup was now set in Christ's view.
				</p><p>
				   (1.) He had a lively apprehension of it impressed at that time on his
				   mind. He had an apprehension of the cup that he was to drink before.
				   His principal errand into the the world was to drink that cup, and he
				   therefore was never unthoughtful of it, but always bore it in his mind,
				   and often spoke of it to his disciples. Thus <reference osisRef="Matt.16.21">Matthew 16:21</reference>. "From that
				   time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go
				   unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and chief
				   priests, and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day
				   ." Again ch. 20:17, 18, 19. "And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the
				   twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, Behold, we go up
				   to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief
				   priests, and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death. And
				   shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to
				   crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again." The same thing was
				   the subject of conversation on the mount with Moses and Elias when he
				   was transfigured. So he speaks of his bloody baptism, <reference osisRef="Luke.12.50">Luke 12:50</reference>. "But
				   I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it
				   be accomplished!" He speaks of it again to Zebedee's children, <reference osisRef="Matt.20.22">Matthew 20:22</reference>. "Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to
				   be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto
				   him, We are able." He spake of his being lifted up. <reference osisRef="John.8.28">John 8:28</reference>. 'Then
				   said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall
				   ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father
				   hath taught me, I speak these things ." <reference osisRef="John.12.34">John 12:34</reference>. "The people
				   answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for
				   ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is
				   this Son of man?" So he spake of destroying the temple of his body,
				   <reference osisRef="John.2.19">John 2:19</reference>. "Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
				   in three days I will raise it up ." And he was very much in speaking of
				   it a little before his agony, in his dying counsels to his disciples in
				   the 12th and 13th ch. of John. Thus this was not the first time that
				   Christ had this bitter cup in his view. On the contrary, he seems
				   always to have had it in view. But it seems that at this time God gave
				   him an extraordinary view of it. A sense of that wrath that was to be
				   poured out upon him, and of those amazing sufferings that he was to
				   undergo, was strongly impressed on his mind by the immediate power of
				   God; so that he had far more full and lively apprehensions of the
				   bitterness of the cup which he was to drink than he ever had before,
				   and these apprehensions were so terrible, that his feeble human nature
				   shrunk at the sight, and was ready to sink.
				</p><p>
				   2. The cup of bitterness was now represented as just at hand. He had
				   not only a more clear and lively view of it than before; but it was now
				   set directly before him, that he might without delay take it up and
				   drink it; for then, within that same hour, Judas was to come with his
				   band of men, and he was then to deliver up himself into their hands to
				   the end that he might drink this cup the next day; unless indeed he
				   refused to take it, and so made his escape from that place where Judas
				   would come; which he had opportunity enough to do if he had been so
				   minded. Having thus shown what those terrible views and apprehensions
				   were which Christ had in the time of his agony; I shall endeavour to
				   show,
				</p><p>
				   II. That the conflict which the soul of Christ then endured was
				   occasioned by those views and apprehensions. The sorrow and distress
				   which his soul then suffered, arose from that lively, and full, and
				   immediate view which he had then given him of that cup of wrath; by
				   which God the Father did as it were set the cup down before him, for
				   him to take it and drink it. Some have inquired, what was the occasion
				   of that distress and agony, and many speculations there have been about
				   it, but the account which the Scripture itself gives us is sufficiently
				   full in this matter, and does not leave room for speculation or doubt.
				   The thing that Christ's mind was so full of at that time was, without
				   doubt, the same with that which his mouth was so full of: it was the
				   dread which his feeble human nature had of that dreadful cup, which was
				   vastly more terrible than Nebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace. He had then a
				   near view of that furnace of wrath, into which he was to be cast; he
				   was brought to the mouth of the furnace that he might look into it, and
				   stand and view its raging flames, and see the glowings of its heat,
				   that he might know where he was going and what he was about to suffer.
				   This was the thing that filled his soul with sorrow and darkness, this
				   terrible sight as it were overwhelmed him. For what was that human
				   nature of Christ to such mighty wrath as this? it was in itself,
				   without the supports of God, but a feeble worm of the dust, a thing
				   that was crushed before the moth, none of God's children ever had such
				   a cup set before them, as this first being of every creature had. But
				   not to dwell any longer on this, I hasten to show,
				</p><p>
				   III. That the conflict in Christ's soul, in this view of his last
				   sufferings, was dreadful, beyond all expression or conception. This
				   will appear,
				</p><p>
				   1. From what is said of its dreadfulness in the history. By one
				   evangelist we are told, (<reference osisRef="Matt.26.37">Matthew 26:37</reference>.) "He began to be sorrowful and
				   very heavy; and by another, (<reference osisRef="Mark.14.33">Mark 14:33</reference>.) "And he taketh with him
				   Peter, and James, and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very
				   heavy." These expressions hold forth the intense and overwhelming
				   distress that his soul was in. Luke's expression in the text of his
				   being in an agony, according to the signification of that word in the
				   original, implies no common degree of sorrow, but such extreme distress
				   that his nature had a most violent conflict with it, as a man that
				   wrestles with all his might with a strong man, who labours and exerts
				   his utmost strength to gain a conquest over him.
				</p><p>
				   2. From what Christ himself says of it, who was not wont to magnify
				   things beyond the truth. He says, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful even
				   unto death." <reference osisRef="Matt.26.38">Matthew 26:38</reference>. What language can more strongly express the
				   most extreme degree of sorrow? His soul was not only "sorrowful," but
				   "exceeding sorrowful;" and not only so, but because that did not fully
				   express the degree of his sorrow, he adds, "even unto death;" which
				   seems to intimate that the very pains and sorrows of hell, of eternal
				   death, had got hold upon him. The Hebrews were wont to express the
				   utmost degree of sorrow that any creature could be liable to by the
				   phrase, the shadow of death. Christ had now, as it were, the shadow of
				   death brought over his soul by the near view which he had of that
				   bitter cup that was now set before him.
				</p><p>
				   3. From the effect which it had on his body, in causing that bloody
				   sweat that we read of in the text. In our translation it is said, that
				   "his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood, falling down to the
				   ground." The word rendered great drops, is in the original qromboi,
				   which properly signifies lumps or clots; for we may suppose that the
				   blood that was pressed out through the pores of his skin by the
				   violence of that inward struggle and conflict that there was, when it
				   came to be exposed to the cool air of the night, congealed and
				   stiffened, as is the nature of blood, and so fell off from him not in
				   drops, but in clots. If the suffering of Christ had occasioned merely a
				   violent sweat, it would have shown that he was in great agony; for it
				   must be an extraordinary grief and exercise of mind that causes the
				   body to be all of a sweat abroad in the open air, in a cold night as
				   that was, as is evident from <reference osisRef="John.18.18">John 18:18</reference>. "And the servants and officers
				   stood there, who had made a fire of coals, (for it was cold,) and they
				   warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself." This
				   was the same night in which Christ had his agony in the garden. But
				   Christ's inward distress and grief was not merely such as caused him to
				   be in a violent and universal sweat, but such as caused him to sweat
				   blood. The distress and anguish of his mind was so unspeakably extreme
				   as to force his blood through the pores of his skin, and that so
				   plentifully as to fall in great clots or drops from his body to the
				   ground. I come now to show,
				</p><p>
				   IV. What may be supposed to be the special end of God's giving Christ
				   beforehand these terrible views of his last sufferings; in other words,
				   why it was needful that he should have a more full and extraordinary
				   view of the cup that he was to drink, a little before he drank it, than
				   ever he had before; or why he must have such a foretaste of the wrath
				   of God to be endured on the cross, before the time came that he was
				   actually to endure it.
				</p><p>
				   Answer. It was needful, in order that he might take the cup and drink
				   it, as knowing what he did. Unless the human nature of Christ had had
				   an extraordinary view given him beforehand of what he was to suffer, he
				   could not, as man, fully know beforehand what he was going to suffer,
				   and therefore could not, as man, know what he did when he took the cup
				   to drink it, because he would not fully have known what the cup was-it
				   being a cup that he never drank before. If Christ had plunged himself
				   into those dreadful sufferings, without being fully sensible beforehand
				   of their bitterness and dreadfulness, he must have done he knew not
				   what. As man, he would have plunged himself into sufferings of the
				   amount of which he was ignorant, and so have acted blindfold; and of
				   course his taking upon him these sufferings could not have been so
				   fully his own act. Christ, as God, perfectly knew what these sufferings
				   were; but it was more needful also that he should know as man; for he
				   was to suffer as man, and the act of Christ in taking that cup was the
				   act of Christ as God man. But the man Christ Jesus hitherto never had
				   had experience of any such sufferings as he was now to endure on the
				   cross; and therefore he could not fully know what they were beforehand,
				   but by having an extraordinary view of them set before him, and an
				   extraordinary sense of them impressed on his mind. We have heard of
				   tortures that others have undergone, but we do not fully know what they
				   were, because we never experienced them; and it is impossible that we
				   should fully know what they were but in one of these two ways, either
				   by experiencing them, or by having a view given of them, or a sense of
				   them impressed in an extraordinary way. Such a sense was impressed on
				   the mind of the man Christ Jesus, in the garden of Gethsemane, of his
				   last sufferings, and that caused his agony. When he had a full sight
				   given him what that wrath of God was that he was to suffer, the sight
				   was overwhelming to him; it made his soul exceeding sorrowful, even
				   unto death. Christ was going to be cast into a dreadful furnace of
				   wrath, and it was not proper that he should plunge himself into it
				   blindfold, as not knowing how dreadful the furnace was. Therefore that
				   he might not do so, God first brought him and set him at the mouth of
				   the furnace, that he might look in, and stand and view its fierce and
				   raging flames, and might see where he was going, and might voluntarily
				   enter into it and bear it for sinners, as knowing what it was. This
				   view Christ had in his agony. Then God brought the cup that he was to
				   drink, and set it down before him, that he might have a full view of
				   it, and see what it was before he took it and drank it. If Christ had
				   not fully known what the dreadfulness of these sufferings was, before
				   he took them upon him, his taking them upon him could not have been
				   fully his own act as man; there could have been no explicit act of his
				   will about that which he was ignorant of; there could have been no
				   proper trial, whether he would be willing to undergo such dreadful
				   sufferings or not, unless he had known beforehand how dreadful they
				   were; but when he had seen what they were, by having an extraordinary
				   view given him of them, and then undertaken to endure them afterwards;
				   then he acted as knowing what he did; then his taking that cup, and
				   bearing such dreadful sufferings, was properly his own act by an
				   explicit choice; and so his love to sinners, in that choice of his, was
				   the more wonderful, as also his obedience to God in it. And it was
				   necessary that this extraordinary view that Christ had of the cup he
				   was to drink should be given at that time, just before he was
				   apprehended. This was the most proper season for it, just before he
				   took the cup, and while he yet had opportunity to refuse the cup; for
				   before he was apprehended by the company led by Judas, he had
				   opportunity to make his escape at pleasure. For the place where he was,
				   was without the city, where he was not at all confined, and was a
				   lonesome, solitary place; and it was the night season; so that he might
				   have gone from that place where he would, and his enemies not have
				   known where to have found him. This view that he had of the bitter cup
				   was given him while he was yet fully at liberty, before he was given
				   into the hands of his enemies. Christ's delivering himself up into the
				   hands of his enemies, as he did when Judas came, which was just after
				   his agony, was properly his act of taking the cup in order to drink;
				   for Christ knew that the issue of that would be his crucifixion the
				   next day. These things may show us the end of Christ's agony, and the
				   necessity there was of such an agony before his last sufferings.
				</p>
				<hi type="bold">APPLICATION.</hi>
				<p>
				   1. Hence we may learn how dreadful Christ's last sufferings were. We
				   learn it from the dreadful effect which the bare foresight of them had
				   upon him in his agony. His last sufferings were so dreadful, that the
				   view which Christ had of them before overwhelmed him and amazed him, as
				   it is said he began to be sore amazed. The very sight of these last
				   sufferings was so very dreadful as to sink his soul down into the dark
				   shadow of death; yea, so dreadful was it, that in the sore conflict
				   which his nature had with it, he was all in a sweat of blood, his body
				   all over was covered with clotted blood, and not only his body, but the
				   very ground under him with the blood that fell from him, which had been
				   forced through his pores through the violence of his agony. And if only
				   the foresight of the cup was so dreadful, how dreadful was the cup
				   itself, how far beyond all that can be uttered or conceived! Many of
				   the martyrs have endured extreme tortures, but from what has been said,
				   there is all reason to think those all were a mere nothing to the last
				   sufferings of Christ on the cross. And what has been said affords a
				   convincing argument that the sufferings which Christ endured in his
				   body on the cross, though they were very dreadful, were yet the least
				   part of his last sufferings; and that beside those, he endured
				   sufferings in his soul which were vastly greater. For if it had been
				   only the sufferings which he endured in his body, though they were very
				   dreadful, we cannot conceive that the mere anticipation of them would
				   have such an effect on Christ. Many of the martyrs, for aught we know,
				   have endured as severe tortures in their bodies as Christ did. Many of
				   the martyrs have been crucified, as Christ was; and yet their souls
				   have not been so overwhelmed. There has been no appearance of such
				   amazing sorrow and distress of mind either at the anticipation of their
				   sufferings, or in the actual enduring of them.
				</p><p>
				   2. From what has been said, we may see the wonderful strength of the
				   love of Christ to sinners. What has been said shows the strength of
				   Christ's love two ways.
				</p><p>
				   1. That it was so strong as to carry him through that agony that he was
				   then in. The suffering that he then was actually subject to, was
				   dreadful and amazing, as has been shown; and how wonderful was his love
				   that lasted and was upheld still! The love of any mere man or angel
				   would doubtless have sunk under such a weight, and never would have
				   endured such a conflict in such a bloody sweat as that of Jesus Christ.
				   The anguish of Christ's soul at that time was so strong as to cause
				   that wonderful effect on his body. But his love to his enemies, poor
				   and unworthy as they were, was stronger still. The heart of Christ at
				   that time was full of distress, but it was fuller of love to vile
				   worms: his sorrows abounded, but his love did much more abound.
				   Christ's soul was overwhelmed with a deluge of grief, but this was from
				   a deluge of love to sinners in his heart sufficient to overflow the
				   world, and overwhelm the highest mountains of its sins. Those great
				   drops of blood that fell down to the ground were a manifestation of an
				   ocean of love in Christ's heart.
				</p><p>
				   2. The strength of Christ's love more especially appears in this, that
				   when he had such a full view of the dreadfulness of the cup that he was
				   to drink, that so amazed him, he would notwithstanding even then take
				   it up, and drink it. Then seems to have been the greatest and most
				   peculiar trial of the strength of the love of Christ, when God set down
				   the bitter portion before him, and let him see what he had to drink, if
				   he persisted in his love to sinners; and brought him to the mouth of
				   the furnace that he might see its fierceness, and have a full view of
				   it, and have time then to consider whether he would go in and suffer
				   the flames of this furnace for such unworthy creatures, or not. This
				   was as it were proposing it to Christ's last consideration what he
				   would do; as much as if it had then been said to him, 'Here is the cup
				   that you are to drink, unless you will give up your undertaking for
				   sinners, and even leave them to perish as they deserve. Will you take
				   this cup, and drink it for them, or not? There is the furnace into
				   which you are to be cast, if they are to be saved; either they must
				   perish, or you must endure this for them. There you see how terrible
				   the heat of the furnace is; you see what pain and anguish you must
				   endure on the morrow, unless you give up the cause of sinners. What
				   will you do? is your love such that you will go on? Will you cast
				   yourself into this dreadful furnace of wrath?' Christ's soul was
				   overwhelmed with the thought; his feeble human nature shrunk at the
				   dismal sight. It put him into this dreadful agony which you have heard
				   described; but his love to sinners held out. Christ would not undergo
				   these sufferings needlessly, if sinners could be saved without. If
				   there was not an absolute necessity of his suffering them in order to
				   their salvation, he desired that the cup might pass from him. But if
				   sinners, on whom he had set his love, could not, agreeably to the will
				   of God, be saved without his drinking it, he chose that the will of God
				   should be done. He chose to go on and endure the suffering, awful as it
				   appeared to him. And this was his final conclusion, after the dismal
				   conflict of his poor feeble human nature, after he had had the cup in
				   view, and for at least the space of one hour, had seen how amazing it
				   was. Still he finally resolved that he would bear it, rather than those
				   poor sinners whom he had loved from all eternity should perish. When
				   the dreadful cup was before him, he did not say within himself, why
				   should I, who am so great and glorious a person, infinitely more
				   honourable than all the angels of heaven, Why should I go to plunge
				   myself into such dreadful, amazing torments for worthless wretched
				   worms that cannot be profitable to God, or me, and that deserve to be
				   hated by me, and not to be loved? Why should I, who have been living
				   from all eternity in the enjoyment of the Father's love, go to cast
				   myself into such a furnace for them that never can requite me for it?
				   Why should I yield myself to be thus crushed by the weight of divine
				   wrath, for them who have no love to me, and are my enemies? they do not
				   deserve any union with me, and never did, and never will do, any thing
				   to recommend themselves to me. What shall I be the richer for having
				   saved a number of miserable haters of God and me, who deserve to have
				   divine justice glorified in their destruction? Such, however, was not
				   the language of Christ's heart, in these circumstances; but on the
				   contrary, his love held out, and he resolved even then, in the midst of
				   his agony, to yield himself up to the will of God, and to take the cup
				   and drink it. He would not flee to get out of the way of Judas and
				   those that were with him, though he knew they were coming, but that
				   same hour delivered himself voluntarily into their hands. When they
				   came with swords and staves to apprehend him, and he could have called
				   upon his Father, who would immediately have sent many legions of angels
				   to repel his enemies, and have delivered him, he would not do it; and
				   when his disciples would have made resistance, he would not suffer
				   them, as you may see in <reference osisRef="Matt.26.51">Matthew 26:51</reference>, and onward: "And, behold, one of
				   them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword,
				   and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. Then
				   said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all
				   they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou
				   that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he will presently give me more
				   than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be
				   fulfilled, that thus it must be? In that same hour said Jesus to the
				   multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief, with swords and staves
				   for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye
				   laid no hold on me. But all this was done that the scriptures of the
				   prophets might be fulfilled." And Christ, instead of hiding himself
				   from Judas and the soldiers, told them, when they seemed to be at a
				   loss whether he was the person whom they sought; and when they seemed
				   still somewhat to hesitate, being seized with some terror in their
				   minds, he told them so again, and so yielded himself up into their
				   hands, to be bound by them, after he had shown them that he could
				   easily resist them if he pleased, when a single word spoken by him,
				   threw them backwards to the ground, as you may see in <reference osisRef="John.18.3">John 18:3</reference>, etc.
				   "Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief
				   priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and
				   weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
				   went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus
				   of Nazareth. Jesus said unto them, I am he. As soon then as he had said
				   unto them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground." Thus
				   powerful, constant, and violent was the love of Christ; and the special
				   trial of his love above all others in his whole life seems to have been
				   in the time of his agony. For though his sufferings were greater
				   afterwards, when he was on the cross, yet he saw clearly what those
				   sufferings were to be, in the time of his agony; and that seems to have
				   been the first time that ever Christ Jesus had a clear view what these
				   sufferings were; and after this the trial was not so great, because the
				   conflict was over. His human nature had been in a struggle with his
				   love to sinners, but his love had got the victory. The thing, upon a
				   full view of his sufferings, had been resolved on and concluded; and
				   accordingly, when the moment arrived, he actually went through with
				   those sufferings.
				</p><p>
				   But there are two circumstances of Christ's agony that do still make
				   the strength and constancy of his love to sinners the more conspicuous.
				</p><p>
				   1. That at the same time that he had such a view of the dreadfulness of
				   his sufferings, he had also an extraordinary view of the hatefulness of
				   the wickedness of those for whom those sufferings were to make
				   atonement. There are two things that render Christ's love wonderful: 1.
				   That he should be willing to endure sufferings that were so great; and
				   2. That he should be willing to endure them to make atonement for
				   wickedness that was so great. But in order to its being properly said,
				   Christ of his own act and choice endured sufferings that were so great,
				   to make atonement for wickedness that was so great, two things were
				   necessary. 1. That he should have an extraordinary sense how great
				   these sufferings were to be, before he endured them. This was given in
				   his agony. And 2. That he should also at the same time have an
				   extraordinary sense how great and hateful was the wickedness of men for
				   which he suffered to make atonement; or how unworthy those were for
				   whom he died. And both these were given at the same time. When Christ
				   had such an extraordinary sense how bitter his cup was to be, he had
				   much to make him sensible how unworthy and hateful that wickedness of
				   mankind was for which he suffered; because the hateful and malignant
				   nature of that corruption never appeared more fully than in the spite
				   and cruelty of men in these sufferings; and yet his love was such that
				   he went on notwithstanding to suffer for them who were full of such
				   hateful corruption.
				</p><p>
				   It was the corruption and wickedness of men that contrived and effected
				   his death; it was the wickedness of men that agreed with Judas, it was
				   the wickedness of men that betrayed him, and that apprehended him, and
				   bound him, and led him away like a malefactor; it was by men's
				   corruption and wickedness that he was arraigned, and falsely accused,
				   and unjustly judged. It was by men's wickedness that he was reproached,
				   mocked, buffeted, and spit upon. It was by men's wickedness that
				   Barabbas was preferred before him. It was men's wickedness that laid
				   the cross upon him to bear, and that nailed him to it, and put him to
				   so cruel and ignominious a death. This tended to give Christ an
				   extraordinary sense of the greatness and hatefulness of the depravity
				   of mankind.
				</p><p>
				   1. Because hereby in the time of his sufferings he had that depravity
				   set before him as it is, without disguise. When it killed Christ, it
				   appeared in its proper colours. Here Christ saw it in its true nature,
				   which is the utmost hatred and contempt of God; in its ultimate
				   tendency and desire, which is to kill God; and in its greatest
				   aggravation and highest act, which is killing a person that was God.
				</p><p>
				   2. Because in these sufferings he felt the fruits of that wickedness.
				   It was then directly levelled against himself, and exerted itself
				   against him to work his reproach and torment, which tended to impress a
				   stronger sense of its hatefulness on the human nature of Christ. But
				   yet at the same time, so wonderful was the love of Christ to those who
				   exhibited this hateful corruption, that he endured those very
				   sufferings to deliver them from the punishment of that very corruption.
				   The wonderfulness of Christ's dying love appears partly in that he died
				   for those that were so unworthy in themselves, as all mankind have the
				   same kind of corruptions in their hearts, and partly in that he died
				   for those who were not only so wicked, but whose wickedness consists in
				   being enemies to him; so that he did not only die for the wicked, but
				   for his own enemies; and partly in that he was willing to die for his
				   enemies at the same time that he was feeling the fruits of their
				   enmity, while he felt the utmost effects and exertions of their spite
				   against him in the greatest possible contempt and cruelty towards him
				   in his own greatest ignominy, torments, and death; and partly in that
				   he was willing to atone for their being his enemies in these very
				   sufferings, and by that very ignominy, torment, and death that was the
				   fruit of it. The sin and wickedness of men, for which Christ suffered
				   to make atonement, was, as it were, set before Christ in his view.
				</p><p>
				   1. In that this wickedness was but a sample of the wickedness of
				   mankind; for the corruption of all mankind is of the same nature, and
				   the wickedness that is in one man's heart is of the same nature and
				   tendency as in another's. As in water, face answereth to face, so the
				   heart of man to man.
				</p><p>
				   2. It is probable that Christ died to make atonement for that
				   individual actual wickedness that wrought his sufferings, that
				   reproached, mocked, buffeted, and crucified him. Some of his
				   crucifiers, for whom he prayed that they might be forgiven, while they
				   were in the very act of crucifying him, were afterwards, in answer to
				   his prayer, converted, by the preaching of Peter; as we have an account
				   of in the 2nd chapter of Acts.
				</p><p>
				   2. Another circumstance of Christ's agony that shows the strength of
				   his love, is the ungrateful carriage of his disciples at that time.
				   Christ's disciples were among those for whom he endured this agony, and
				   among those for whom he was going to endure those last sufferings, of
				   which he now had such dreadful apprehensions. Yet Christ had already
				   given them an interest in the benefits of those sufferings. Their sins
				   had already been forgiven them through that blood that he was going to
				   shed, and they had been infinite gainers already by that dying pity and
				   love which he had to them, and had through his sufferings been
				   distinguished from all the world besides. Christ had put greater honour
				   upon them than any other, by making them his disciples in a more
				   honourable sense than he had done any other. And yet now, when he had
				   that dreadful cup set before him which he was going to drink for them,
				   and was in such an agony at the sight of it, he saw no return on their
				   part but indifference and ingratitude. When he only desired them to
				   watch with him, that he might be comforted in their company, now at
				   this sorrowful moment they fell asleep; and showed that they had not
				   concern enough about it to induce them to keep awake with him even for
				   one hour, though he desired it of them once and again. But yet this
				   ungrateful treatment of theirs, for whom he was to drink the cup of
				   wrath which God had set before him, did not discourage him from taking
				   it, and drinking it for them. His love held out to them; having loved
				   his own, he loved them to the end. He did not say within himself when
				   this cup of trembling was before him, Why should I endure so much for
				   those that are so ungrateful; why should I here wrestle with the
				   expectation of the terrible wrath of God to be borne by me to-morrow,
				   for them that in the mean time have not so much concern for me as to
				   keep awake with me when I desire it of them even for one hour? But on
				   the contrary, with tender and fatherly compassions he excuses this
				   ingratitude of his disciples, and says, <reference osisRef="Matt.26.41">Matthew 26:41</reference>. "Watch and pray,
				   that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but
				   the flesh is weak;" and went and was apprehended, and mocked, and
				   scourged, and crucified, and poured out his soul unto death, under the
				   heavy weight of God's dreadful wrath on the cross for them.
				</p><p>
				   3rd Inference. From what has been said, we may learn the wonderfulness
				   of Christ's submission to the will of God. Christ, as he was a divine
				   person, was the absolute sovereign of heaven and earth, but yet he was
				   the most wonderful instance of submission to God's sovereignty that
				   ever was. When he had such a view of the terribleness of his last
				   sufferings, and prayed if it were possible that that cup might pass
				   from him, i.e. if there was not an absolute necessity of it in order to
				   the salvation of sinners, yet it was with a perfect submission to the
				   will of God. He adds, "Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done."
				   He chose rather that the inclination of his human nature, which so much
				   dreaded such exquisite torments, should be crossed, than that God's
				   will should not take place. He delighted in the thought of God's will
				   being done; and when he went and prayed the second time, he had nothing
				   else to say but, "O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me except
				   I drink it, thy will be done;" and so the third time. What are such
				   trials of submission as any of us sometimes have in the afflictions
				   that we suffer in comparison of this? If God does but in his providence
				   signify it to be his will that we should part with a child, how hardly
				   are we brought to yield to it, how ready to be unsubmissive and
				   froward! Or if God lays his hand upon us in some acute pain of body,
				   how ready are we to be discontented and impatient; when the innocent
				   Son of God, who deserved no suffering could quietly submit to
				   sufferings inconceivably great, and say it over and over, God's will be
				   done! When he was brought and set before that dreadful furnace of wrath
				   into which he was to be cast, in order that he might look into it and
				   have a full view of its fierceness, when his flesh shrunk at it, and
				   his nature was in such a conflict, that his body was all covered with a
				   sweat of blood falling in great drops to the ground, yet his soul
				   quietly yielded that the will of God should be done, rather than the
				   will or inclination of his human nature.
				</p><p>
				   4th Infer. What has been said on this subject also shows us the glory
				   of Christ's obedience. Christ was subject to the moral law as Adam was,
				   and he was also subject to the ceremonial and judicial laws of Moses;
				   but the principal command that he had received of the Father was, that
				   he should lay down his life, that he should voluntarily yield up
				   himself to those terrible sufferings on the cross. To do this was his
				   principal errand into the world; and doubtless the principal command
				   that he received, was about that which was the principal errand on
				   which he was sent. The Father, when he sent him into the world, sent
				   him with commands concerning what he should do in the world; and his
				   chief command of all was about that, which was the errand he was
				   chiefly sent upon, which was to lay down his life. And therefore this
				   command was the principal trial of his obedience. It was the greatest
				   trial of his obedience, because it was by far the most difficult
				   command: all the rest were easy in comparison of this. And the main
				   trial that Christ had, whether he would obey this command, was in the
				   time of his agony; for that was within an hour before he was
				   apprehended in order to his sufferings, when he must either yield
				   himself up to them, or fly from them. And then it was the first time
				   that Christ had a full view of the difficulty of this command; which
				   appeared so great as to cause that bloody sweat. Then was the conflict
				   of weak human nature with the difficulty, then was the sore struggles
				   and wrestling with the heavy trial he had, and then Christ got the
				   victory over the temptation, from the dread of his human nature. His
				   obedience held out through the conflict. Then we may suppose that Satan
				   was especially let loose to set in with the natural dread that the
				   human nature had of such torments, and to strive to his utmost to
				   dissuade Christ from going on to drink the bitter cup; for about that
				   time, towards the close of Christ's life, was he especially delivered
				   up into the hands of Satan to be tempted of him, more than he was
				   immediately after his baptism; for Christ says, speaking of that time,
				   <reference osisRef="Luke.22.53">Luke 22:53</reference>. "When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched
				   forth no hands against me; but this is your hour, and the power of
				   darkness." So that Christ, in the time of his agony, was wrestling not
				   only with overwhelming views of his last sufferings, but he also
				   wrestled, in that bloody sweat, with principalities and powers - he
				   contended at that time with the great leviathan that laboured to his
				   utmost to tempt him to disobedience. So that then Christ had
				   temptations every way to draw him off from obedience to God. He had
				   temptations from his feeble human nature, that exceedingly dreaded such
				   torments; and he had temptations from men, who were his enemies; and he
				   had temptations from the ungrateful carriage of his own disciples; and
				   he had temptations from the devil. He had also an overwhelming trial
				   from the manifestation of God's own wrath; when, in the words of
				   Isaiah, it pleased the Lord to bruise him and put him to grief. But yet
				   he failed not, but got the victory over all, and performed that great
				   act of obedience at that time to that same God that hid himself from
				   him, and was showing his wrath to him for men's sins, which he must
				   presently suffer. Nothing could move him away from his steadfast
				   obedience to God, but he persisted in saying, "Thy will be done:"
				   expressing not only his submission, but his obedience; not only his
				   compliance with the disposing will of God, but also with his preceptive
				   will. God had given him this cup to drink, and had commanded him to
				   drink it, and that was reason enough with him to drink it; hence he
				   says, at the conclusion of his agony, when Judas came with his band,
				   "The cup which my Father giveth me to drink, shall I not drink it?"
				   <reference osisRef="John.18.11">John 18:11</reference>. Christ, at the time of his agony, had an inconceivably
				   greater trial of obedience than any man or any angel ever had. How much
				   was this trial of the obedience of the second Adam beyond the trial of
				   the obedience of the first Adam! How light was our first father's
				   temptation in comparison of this! And yet our first surety failed, and
				   our second failed not, but obtained a glorious victory, and went and
				   became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Thus wonderful
				   and glorious was the obedience of Christ, by which he wrought out
				   righteousness for believers, and which obedience is imputed to them. No
				   wonder that it is a sweet penalty sown, and that God stands ready to
				   bestow heaven as its reward on all that believe on him.
				</p><p>
				   5. What has been said shows us the sottishness of secure sinners in
				   being so fearless of the wrath of God. If the wrath of God was so
				   dreadful, that, when Christ only expected it, his human nature was
				   nearly overwhelmed with the fear of it, and his soul was amazed, and
				   his body all over in a bloody sweat; then how sottish are sinners, who
				   are under the threatening of the same wrath of God, and are condemned
				   to it, and are every moment exposed to it; and yet, instead of
				   manifesting intense apprehension, are quiet and easy, and unconcerned;
				   instead of being sorrowful and very heavy, go about with a light and
				   careless heart; instead of crying out in bitter agony, are often gay
				   and cheerful, and eat and drink, and sleep quietly, and go on in sin,
				   provoking the wrath of God more and more, without any great matter of
				   concern! How stupid and sottish are such persons! Let such senseless
				   sinners consider, that that misery, of which they are in danger from
				   the wrath of God, is infinitely more terrible than that, the fear of
				   which occasioned in Christ his agony and bloody sweat. It is more
				   terrible, both as it differs both in its nature and degree, and also as
				   it differs in its duration. It is more terrible in its nature and
				   degree. Christ suffered that which, as it upheld the honour of the
				   divine law, was fully equivalent to the misery of the damned; and in
				   some respect it was the same suffering; for it was the wrath of the
				   same God; but yet in other respects it vastly differed. The difference
				   does not arise from the difference in the wrath poured out on one and
				   the other, for it is the same wrath, but from the difference of the
				   subject, which may be best illustrated from Christ's own comparison.
				   <reference osisRef="Luke.23.31">Luke 23:31</reference>. "For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be
				   done in the dry?" Here he calls himself the green tree, and wicked men
				   the dry, intimating that the misery that will come on wicked men will
				   be far more dreadful than those sufferings which came on him, and the
				   difference arises from the different nature of the subject. The green
				   tree and the dry are both cast into the fire; but the flames seize and
				   kindle on the dry tree much more fiercely than on the green. The
				   sufferings that Christ endured differ from the misery of the wicked in
				   hell in nature and degree in the following respects.
				</p><p>
				   1. Christ felt not the gnawings of a guilty, condemning conscience.
				</p><p>
				   2. He felt no torment from the reigning of inward corruptions and lusts
				   as the damned do. The wicked in hell are their own tormentors, their
				   lusts are their tormentors, and being without restraint, (for there is
				   no restraining grace in hell,) their lusts will rage like raging flames
				   in their hearts. They shall be tormented with the unrestrained violence
				   of a spirit of envy and malice against God, and against the angels and
				   saints in heaven, and against one another. Now Christ suffered nothing
				   of this.
				</p><p>
				   3. Christ had not to consider that God hated him. The wicked in hell
				   have this to make their misery perfect, they know that God perfectly
				   hates them without the least pity or regard to them, which will fill
				   their souls with inexpressible misery. But it was not so with Christ.
				   God withdrew his comfortable presence from Christ, and hid his face
				   from him, and so poured out his wrath upon him, as made him feel its
				   terrible effects in his soul; but yet he knew at the same time that God
				   did not hate him, but infinitely loved him. He cried out of God's
				   forsaking him, but yet at the same time calls him "My God, my God!"
				   knowing that he was his God still, though he had forsaken him. But the
				   wicked in hell will know that he is not their God, but their judge and
				   irreconcilable enemy.
				</p><p>
				   4. Christ did not suffer despair, as the wicked do in hell. He knew
				   that there would be an end to his sufferings in a few hours; and that
				   after that he should enter into eternal glory. But it will be far
				   otherwise with you that are impenitent; if you die in your present
				   condition, you will be in perfect despair. On these accounts, the
				   misery of the wicked in hell will be immensely more dreadful in nature
				   and degree, than those sufferings with the fears of which Christ's soul
				   was so much overwhelmed.
				</p><p>
				   2. It will infinitely differ in duration. Christ's sufferings lasted
				   but a few hours, and there was an eternal end to them, and eternal
				   glory succeeded. But you that are a secure, senseless sinner, are every
				   day exposed to be cast into everlasting misery, a fire that never shall
				   be quenched. If then the Son of God was in such amazement, in the
				   expectation of what he was to suffer for a few hours, how sottish are
				   you who are continually exposed to sufferings, immensely more dreadful
				   in nature and degree, and that are to be without any end, but which
				   must be endured without any rest day or night for ever and ever! If you
				   had a full sense of the greatness of that misery to which you are
				   exposed, and how dreadful your present condition is on that account, it
				   would this moment put you into as dreadful an agony as that which
				   Christ underwent; yea, if your nature could endure it, one much more
				   dreadful. We should now see you fall down in a bloody sweat, wallowing
				   in your gore, and crying out in terrible amazement.
				</p><p>
				   Having thus endeavoured to explain and illustrate the former of the two
				   propositions mentioned in the commencement of this discourse, I shall
				   now proceed to show,
				</p><p>
				   II. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden was in a great
				   and earnest strife and conflict in his prayer to God. The labour and
				   striving of Christ's soul in prayer was a part of his agony, and was
				   without doubt a part of what is intended in the text, when it is said
				   that Christ was in an agony; for, as we have shown, the word is
				   especially used in Scripture in other places for striving or wrestling
				   with God in prayer. From this fact, and from the evangelist mentioning
				   his being in agony, and his praying earnestly in the same sentence, we
				   may well understand him as mentioning his striving in prayer as part of
				   his agony. The words of the text seem to hold forth as much as that
				   Christ was in an agony in prayer: "Being in an agony, he prayed more
				   earnestly; and his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling
				   to the ground." This language seems to imply thus much, that the labour
				   and earnestness of Christ's soul was so great in his wrestling with God
				   in prayer, that he was in a mere agony, and all over in a sweat of
				   blood.
				</p><p>
				   What I propose now, in this second proposition, is by the help of God
				   to explain this part of Christ's agony which consisted in the agonizing
				   and wrestling of his soul in prayer; which is the more worthy of a
				   particular inquiry, being that which probably is but little understood;
				   though, as may appear in the sequel, the right understanding of it is
				   of great use and consequence in divinity. It is not as I conceive
				   ordinarily well understood what is meant when it is said in the text
				   that Christ prayed more earnestly; or what was the thing that he
				   wrestled with God for, or what was the subject matter of this earnest
				   prayer, or what was the reason of his being so very earnest in prayer
				   at this time. And therefore, to set this whole matter in a clear light,
				   I would particularly inquire,
				</p><p>
				   1. Of what nature this prayer was;
				</p><p>
				   2. What was the subject matter of this earnest prayer of Christ to the
				   Father;
				</p><p>
				   3. In what capacity Christ offered up this prayer to God;
				</p><p>
				   4. Why he was so earnest in his prayer;
				</p><p>
				   5. What was the success of this his earnest wrestling with God in
				   prayer; and then make some improvement.
				</p><p>
				   I. Of what nature this prayer of Christ was.
				</p><p>
				   Addresses that are made to God may be of various kinds. Some are
				   confessions on the part of the individual, or expressions of his sense
				   of his own unworthiness before God, and are thus penitential addresses
				   to God. Others are doxologies or prayers intended to express the sense
				   which the person has of God's greatness and glory. Such are many of the
				   psalms of David. Others are gratulatory addresses, or expressions of
				   thanksgiving and praise for mercies received. Others are submissive
				   addresses, or expressions of submission and resignation to the will of
				   God, whereby he that addresses the Majesty of heaven, expresses the
				   compliance of his will with the sovereign will of God; saying, "Thy
				   will, O Lord, be done!" as David, <reference osisRef="2Sam.15.26">2 Samuel 15:26</reference>. "But if he thus say, I
				   have no delight in thee; behold, here am I; let him do to me as seemeth
				   good unto him." Others are petitory or supplicatory; whereby the person
				   that prays, begs of God and cries to him for some favour desired of
				   him.
				</p><p>
				   Hence the inquiry is, of which of these kinds was the prayer of Christ,
				   that we read of in the text.
				</p><p>
				   Answer. It was chiefly supplicatory. It was not penitential or
				   confessional; for Christ had no sin or unworthiness to confess. Nor was
				   it a doxology or a thanksgiving or merely an expression of submission;
				   for none of these agree with what is said in the text, viz. that he
				   prayed more earnestly. When any one is said to pray earnestly, it
				   implies an earnest request for some benefit, or favour desired; and not
				   merely a confession, or submission, or gratulation. So what the apostle
				   says of this prayer, in <reference osisRef="Heb.5.7">Hebrews 5:7</reference>. "Who in the days of his flesh, when
				   he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and
				   tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard, in
				   that he feared," shows that it was petitory, or an earnest supplication
				   for some desired benefit. They are not confessions, or doxologies, or
				   thanksgivings. or resignations, that are called "supplications" and
				   "strong cyings," but petitions for some benefit earnestly desired. And
				   having thus resolved the first inquiry, and shown that this earnest
				   prayer of Christ -was of the nature of a supplication for some benefit
				   or favour which Christ earnestly desired, I come to inquire,
				</p><p>
				   II. What was the subject matter of this supplication; or what favour
				   and benefit that was for which Christ so earnestly supplicated in this
				   prayer of which we have an account in the text. Now the words of the
				   text are not express on this matter. It is said that Christ, "being in
				   an agony, prayed more earnestly;" but yet it is not said what he prayed
				   so earnestly for. And here is the greatest difficulty attending this
				   account: even what that was which Christ so earnestly desired, for
				   which he so wrestled with God at that time. And though we are not
				   expressly told in the text, yet the Scriptures have not left us without
				   sufficient light in this matter. And the more effectually to avoid
				   mistakes, I would answer,
				</p><p>
				   1. Negatively, the thing that Christ so earnestly prayed for at this
				   time, was not that the bitter cup which he had to drink might pass from
				   him. Christ had before prayed for this, as in the next verse but one
				   before the text, saying "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup
				   from me! nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done!" It is after
				   this that we have an account that Christ being in an agony, prayed more
				   earnestly; but we are not to understand that he prayed more earnestly
				   than he had done before, that the cup might pass from him. That this
				   was not the thing that he so earnestly prayed for in this second
				   prayer, the following things seem to prove:
				</p><p>
				   1. This second prayer was after the angel had appeared to him from
				   heaven, strengthening him, the more cheerfully to take the cup and
				   drink it. The evangelists inform us that when Christ came into the
				   garden, he began to be sorrowful, and very heavy, and that he said his
				   soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, and that then he went
				   and prayed to God, that if it were possible the cup might pass from
				   him. Luke says in the 41st and 42nd verses, "that being withdrawn from
				   his disciples about a stone's cast, he kneeled down and prayed, saying,
				   Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not
				   my will, but thine be done!" And then, after this, it is said in the
				   next verse, that there appeared an angel from heaven unto him
				   strengthening him. Now this can be understood no otherwise than that
				   the angel appeared to him, strengthening him and encouraging him to go
				   through his great and difficult work, to take the cup and drink it.
				   Accordingly we must suppose, that now Christ was more strengthened and
				   encouraged to go through with his sufferings: and therefore we cannot
				   suppose that after this he would pray more earnestly than before to be
				   delivered from his sufferings; and of course that it was something else
				   that Christ more earnestly prayed for, after that strengthening of the
				   angel, and not that the cup might pass from him. Though Christ seems to
				   have a greater sight of his sufferings given him after this
				   strengthening of the angel than before, that caused such an agony, yet
				   he was more strengthened to fit him for a greater sight of them, he had
				   greater strength and courage to grapple with these awful apprehensions,
				   than before. His strength to bear sufferings is increased with the
				   sense of his sufferings.
				</p><p>
				   2. Christ, before his second prayer, had had an intimation from the
				   Father, that it was not his will that the cup should pass from him. The
				   angel's coming from heaven to strengthen him must be so understood.
				   Christ first prays, that if it may be the will of the Father, the cup
				   might pass; but not, if it was not his will; and then God immediately
				   upon this sends an angel to strengthen, and encourage him to take the
				   cup, which was a plain intimation to Christ that it was the Father's
				   will that he should take it, and that it should not pass from him. And
				   so Christ received it; as appears from the account which Matthew gives
				   of this second prayer. <reference osisRef="Matt.26.42">Matthew 26:42</reference>. "He went away again the second time
				   and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me
				   except I drink it, thy will be done." He speaks as one that now had had
				   an intimation, since he prayed before, that it was not the will of God.
				   And Luke tells us how, viz. by God's sending an angel. Matthew informs
				   us, as Luke does, that in his first prayer, he prayed that if it were
				   possible the cup might pass from him; but then God sends an angel to
				   signify that it was not his will, and to encourage him to take it. And
				   then Christ having received this plain intimation that it was not the
				   will of God that the cup should pass from him, yields to the message he
				   had received, and says, O my Father, if it be so as thou hast now
				   signified, thy will be done. Therefore we may surely conclude that what
				   Christ prayed more earnestly for after this, was not that the cup might
				   pass from him, but something else; for he would not go to pray more
				   earnestly that the cup might pass from him, after God had signified
				   that it was not his will that it should pass from him, than he did
				   before; that would be blasphemous to suppose. And then,
				</p><p>
				   3dly, The language of the second prayer, as recited by Matthew, "O my
				   Father, if this cup may not pass from me except I drink it, thy will be
				   done," shows that Christ did not then pray that the cup might pass from
				   him. This certainly is not praying more earnestly that the cup might
				   pass: it is rather a yielding that point, and ceasing any more to urge
				   it, and submitting to it as a thing now determined by the will of God,
				   made known by the angel. And,
				</p><p>
				   4. From the apostle's account of this prayer in the 5th ch. of Hebrews,
				   the words of the apostle are these, "Who in the days of his flesh, when
				   he had offered up his prayers and supplications, with strong crying and
				   tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in
				   that he feared." The strong crying and tears of which the apostle
				   speaks, are doubtless the same that Luke speaks of in the text, when he
				   says, "he being in an agony, prayed more earnestly;" for this was the
				   sharpest and most earnest crying of Christ, of which we have any where
				   any account. But according to the apostle's account, that which Christ
				   feared, and that for which he so strongly cried to God in this prayer,
				   was something that he was heard in, something that God granted him his
				   request in, and therefore it was not that the cup might pass from him.
				   Having thus shown what it was not that Christ prayed for in this
				   earnest prayer, I proceed to show,
				</p><p>
				   2nd, What it was that Christ so earnestly sought of God in this prayer.
				</p><p>
				   I answer in one word, it was, That God's will might be done, in what
				   related to his sufferings. Matthew gives this express account of it, in
				   the very language of the prayer which has been recited several times
				   already, "O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink
				   it, thy will be done!" This is a yielding, and an expression of
				   submission; but it is not merely that. Such words, "The will of the
				   Lord be done," as they are most commonly used, are not understood as a
				   supplication or request, but only as an expression of submission. But
				   the words are not always to be understood in that sense in Scripture,
				   but sometimes are to be understood as a request. So they are to be
				   understood in the third petition of the Lord's prayer, "Thy will be
				   done in earth as in heaven." There the words are to be understood both
				   as an expression of submission, and also a request, as they are
				   explained in the Assembly's Catechism, and so the words are to be
				   understood here. The evangelist Mark says that Christ went away again
				   and spake the same words that he had done in his first prayer. <reference osisRef="Mark.14.39">Mark 14:39</reference>. But then we must understand it as of the same words with the
				   latter part of his first prayer, "nevertheless not my will but thine be
				   done," as Matthew's more full and particular account shows. So that the
				   thing mentioned in the text, for which Christ was wrestling with God in
				   this prayer, was, that God's will might be done in what related to his
				   sufferings.
				</p><p>
				   But then here another inquiry may arise, viz. What is implied in
				   Christ's praying that God's will might be done in what related to his
				   sufferings? To this I answer,
				</p><p>
				   1. This implies a request that he might be strengthened and supported,
				   and enabled to do God's will, by going through with these sufferings.
				   The same as when he says, "Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is
				   written of me, to do thy will, O God." It was the preceptive will of
				   God that he should take that cup and drink it: it was the Father's
				   command to him. The Father had given him the cup, and as it were set it
				   down before him with the command that he should drink it. This was the
				   greatest act of obedience that Christ was to perform. He prays for
				   strength and help, that his poor feeble human nature might be
				   supported, that he might not fail in this great trial, that he might
				   not sink and be swallowed up, and his strength so overcome that he
				   should not hold out, and finish the appointed obedience. This was the
				   thing that he feared, of which the apostle speaks in the 5th of
				   Hebrews, when he says,"he was heard in that he feared." When he had
				   such an extraordinary sense of the dreadfulness of his sufferings
				   impressed on his mind, the fearfulness of it amazed him. He was afraid
				   lest his poor feeble strength should be overcome, and that he should
				   fail in so great a trial, that he should be swallowed up by that death
				   that he was to die, and so should not be saved from death; and
				   therefore he offered up strong crying and tears unto him that was able
				   to strengthen him, and support, and save him from death, that the death
				   he was to suffer might not overcome his love and obedience, but that he
				   might overcome death, and so be saved from it. If Christ's courage had
				   failed in the trial, and he had not held out under his dying
				   sufferings, he never would have been saved from death, but he would
				   have sunk in the deep mire; he never would have risen from the dead,
				   for his rising from the dead was a reward of his victory. If his
				   courage had failed, and he had given up, he would have remained from
				   under the power of death, and so we should all have perished, we should
				   have remained yet in our sins. If he had failed, all would have failed.
				   If he had not overcome in that sore conflict, neither he nor we could
				   have been freed from death, we all must have perished together.
				   Therefore this was the saving from death that the apostle speaks of,
				   that Christ feared and prayed for with strong crying and tears. His
				   being overcome of death was the thing that he feared, and so he was
				   heard in that he feared. This Christ prayed, that the will of God might
				   be done in his sufferings, even that he might not fail of obeying God's
				   will in his sufferings; and therefore it follows in the next verse in
				   that passage of Hebrews, "Though he were a Son, yet learned he
				   obedience by the things which he suffered." That it was in this respect
				   that Christ in his agony so earnestly prayed that the will of God might
				   be done, viz. that he might have strength to do his will, and might not
				   sink and fail in such great sufferings; is confirmed from the
				   scriptures of the Old Testament, as particularly from the 69th Psalm.
				   The psalmist represents Christ in that psalm, as is evident from the
				   fact that the words of that psalm are represented as Christ's words in
				   many places of the New Testament. That psalm is represented as Christ's
				   prayer to God when his soul was overwhelmed with sorrow and amazement,
				   as it was in his agony; as you may see in the 1st and 2nd verses, "Save
				   me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul: I sink in deep
				   mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the
				   floods overflow me." But then the thing that is represented as being
				   the thing that he feared, was failing, and being overwhelmed, in this
				   great trial: verses 14 and 15. "Deliver me out of the mire, and let me
				   not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the
				   deep waters. Let not the water- flood overflow me, neither let the deep
				   swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me." So again in
				   the 22d Psalm, which is also represented as the prayer of Christ under
				   his dreadful sorrow and sufferings, verses 19, 20, 21. "But be not thou
				   far from me, O Lord; O my Strength, haste thee to help me. Deliver my
				   soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. Save me from
				   the lion's mouth." It was meet and suitable that Christ, when about to
				   engage in that terrible conflict, should thus earnestly seek help from
				   God to enable him to do his will; for he needed God's help-the
				   strength of his human nature, without divine help, was not sufficient
				   to carry him through. This was, without doubt, that in which the first
				   Adam failed in his first trial, that when the trial came he was not
				   sensible of his own weakness and dependence. If he had been, and had
				   leaned on God, and cried to him for his assistance and strength against
				   the temptation, in all likelihood we should have remained innocent and
				   happy creatures to this day.
				</p><p>
				   2. It implies a request that God's will and purpose might be obtained
				   in the effects and fruits of his sufferings, in the glory to his name,
				   that was his design in them; and particularly in the glory of his
				   grace, in the eternal salvation and happiness of his elect. This is
				   confirmed by <reference osisRef="John.12.27 John.12.28">John 12:27-28</reference>. "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I
				   say?- Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto
				   this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from
				   heaven, saying, I have both glorified, and will glorify it again."
				   There the first request is the same with the first request of Christ
				   here in like trouble: "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
				   Father, save me from this hour." He first prays, as he does here, that
				   he might be saved from his last sufferings. Then, after he was
				   determined within himself that the will of God must be otherwise, that
				   he should not be saved from that hour, "but for this cause," says he,
				   "came I to this hour;" and then his second request after this is,
				   "Father, glorify thy name!" So this is doubtless the purport of the
				   second request in his agony, when he prayed that God's will might be
				   done. It is that God's will might be done in that glory to his own name
				   that he intended in the effects and fruits of his sufferings, that
				   seeing that it was his will that he should suffer, he earnestly prays
				   that the end of his suffering, in the glory of God and the salvation of
				   the elect, may not fail. And these things are what Christ so earnestly
				   wrestled with God for in his prayer, of which we have an account in the
				   text, and we have no reason to think that they were not expressed in
				   prayer as well as implied. It is not reasonable to suppose that the
				   evangelist in his other account of things mentions all the words of
				   Christ's prayer. He only mentions the substance.
				</p><p>
				   III. In what capacity did Christ offer up those earnest prayers to God
				   in his agony?
				</p><p>
				   In answer to this inquiry, I observe that he offered them up not as a
				   private person, but as high priest. The apostle speaks of the strong
				   crying and tears, as what Christ offered up as high priest. <reference osisRef="Heb.5.6 Heb.5.7">Hebrews 5:6-7</reference>.
				   "As he says also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever, after
				   the order of Melchisedek: who in the days of his flesh, when he had
				   offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears,"
				   etc. The things that Christ prayed for in those strong cryings, were
				   things not of a private nature, but of common concern to the whole
				   church of which he was the high priest. That the will of God should be
				   done in his obedience unto death, that his strength and courage should
				   not fail, but that he should hold out, was of common concern; for, if
				   he had failed, all would have failed and perished for ever. And of
				   course, that God's name should be glorified in the effects and fruits
				   of his sufferings, and in the salvation and glory of all his elect, was
				   a thing of common concern. Christ offered up these strong cries with
				   his flesh in the same manner as the priests of old were wont to offer
				   up prayers with their sacrifices. Christ mixed strong crying and tears
				   with his blood, and so offered up his blood and his prayers together,
				   that the effect and success of his blood might be obtained. Such
				   earnest agonizing prayers were offered with his blood, and his
				   infinitely precious and meritorious blood was offered with his prayers.
				</p><p>
				   IV. Why was Christ so earnest in those supplications? Luke speaks of
				   them as very earnest; the apostle speaks of them as strong crying; and
				   his agony partly consisted in this earnestness: and the account that
				   Luke gives us, seems to imply that his bloody sweat was partly at least
				   with the great labour and earnest sense of his soul in wrestling with
				   God in prayer. There were three things that concurred at that time,
				   especially to cause Christ to be thus earnest and engaged.
				</p><p>
				   1. He had then an extraordinary sense how dreadful the consequence
				   would be, if God's will should fail of being done. He had then an
				   extraordinary sense of his own last suffering under the wrath of God,
				   and if he had failed in those sufferings, he knew the consequence must
				   be dreadful. He having now such an extraordinary view of the
				   terribleness of the wrath of God, his love to the elect tended to make
				   him more than ordinarily earnest that they might be delivered from
				   suffering that wrath to all eternity, which could not have been if he
				   had failed of doing God's will, or if the will of God in the effect of
				   his suffering had failed.
				</p><p>
				   2. No wonder that that extraordinary sense that Christ then had of the
				   costliness of the means of sinners' salvation, made him very earnest
				   for the success of those means, as you have already heard.
				</p><p>
				   3. Christ had an extraordinary sense of his dependence on God, and his
				   need of his help to enable him to do God's will in this great trial.
				   Though he was innocent, yet he needed divine help. He was dependent on
				   God, as man, and therefore we read that he trusted in God. <reference osisRef="Matt.27.43">Matthew 27:43</reference>.
				   "He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for
				   he said, I am the Son of God." And when he had such an extraordinary
				   sight of the dreadfulness of that wrath he was to suffer, he saw how
				   much it was beyond the strength of his human nature alone.
				</p><p>
				   V. What was the success of this prayer of Christ?
				</p><p>
				   To this I answer, He obtained all his requests. The apostle says, "He
				   was heard in that he feared;" in all that he feared. He obtained
				   strength and help from God, all that he needed, and was carried
				   through. He was enabled to do and to suffer the whole will of God; and
				   he obtained the whole of the end of his sufferings-a full atonement
				   for the sins of the whole world, and the full salvation of every one of
				   those who were given him in the covenant of redemption, and all that
				   glory to the name of God, which his mediation was designed to
				   accomplish, not one jot or tittle hath failed. Herein Christ in his
				   agony was above all others Jacob's antitype, in his wrestling with God
				   for a blessing; which Jacob did, not as a private person, but as the
				   head of his posterity, the nation of Israel, and by which he obtained
				   that commendation of God, "As a prince thou hast power with God;" and
				   therein was a type of him who was the Prince of princes.
				</p>
				<hi type="bold">APPLICATION.</hi>
				<p>
				   Great improvement may be made of the consideration of the strong crying
				   and tears of Christ in the days of his flesh, many ways for our
				   benefit.
				</p><p>
				   1. This may teach us after what manner we should pray to God, not in a
				   cold and careless manner, but with great earnestness and engagedness of
				   spirit, and especially when we are praying to God for those things that
				   are of infinite importance, such as spiritual and eternal blessings.
				   Such were the benefits that Christ prayed for with such strong crying
				   and tears, that he might be enabled to do God's will in that great and
				   difficult work that God had appointed him, that he might not sink and
				   fail, but might get the victory, and so finally be delivered from
				   death, and that God's will and end might be obtained as the fruit of
				   his sufferings, in the glory of God, and the salvation of the elect.
				</p><p>
				   When we go before God in prayer with a cold, dull heart, and in a
				   lifeless and listless manner pray to him for eternal blessings, and
				   those of infinite import to our souls, we should think of Christ's
				   earnest prayers that he poured out to God, with tears and a bloody
				   sweat. The consideration of it may well make us ashamed of our dull,
				   lifeless prayers to God, wherein, indeed, we rather ask a denial than
				   ask to be heard; for the language of such a manner of praying to God,
				   is, that we do not look upon the benefit that we pray for as of any
				   great importance, that we are indifferent whether God answers us or
				   not. The example of Jacob in wrestling with God for the blessing,
				   should teach us earnestness in our prayers, but more especially the
				   example of Jesus Christ, who wrestled with God in a bloody sweat. If we
				   were sensible as Christ was of the great importance of those benefits
				   that are of eternal consequence, our prayers to God for such benefits
				   would be after another manner than now they are. Our souls also would
				   with earnest labour and strife be engaged in this duty.
				</p><p>
				   There are many benefits that we ask of God in our prayers, which are
				   every whit of as great importance to us as those benefits which Christ
				   asked of God in his agony were to him. It is of as great importance to
				   us that we should be enabled to do the will of God, and perform a
				   sincere, universal, and persevering obedience to his commands, as it
				   was to Christ that he should not fail of doing God's will in his great
				   work. It is of as great importance to us to be saved from death, as it
				   was to Christ that he should get the victory over death, and so be
				   saved from it. It is of as great, and infinitely greater, importance to
				   us, that Christ's redemption should be successful in us, as it was to
				   him that God's will should be done, in the fruits and success of his
				   redemption.
				</p><p>
				   Christ recommended earnest watchfulness and prayerfulness to his
				   disciples, by prayer and example, both at the same time. When Christ
				   was in his agony, and came and found his disciples asleep, he bid them
				   watch and pray, <reference osisRef="Matt.26.41">Matthew 26:41</reference>. "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
				   temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." At
				   the same time he set them an example of that which he commanded them,
				   for though they slept he watched, and poured out his soul in those
				   earnest prayers that you have heard of; and Christ has elsewhere taught
				   us to ask those blessings of God that are of infinite importance, as
				   those that will take no denial. We have another example of the great
				   conflicts and engagedness of Christ's spirit in this duty. <reference osisRef="Luke.6.12">Luke 6:12</reference>.
				   "And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to
				   pray, and continued all night in prayer to God." And he was often
				   recommending earnestness in crying to God in prayers. In the parable of
				   the unjust judge, Luke 18 at the beginning; "And he spake a parable
				   unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
				   saying There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
				   regarded man; and there was a widow in that city; and she came unto
				   him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not for awhile:
				   but afterwards he saith within himself, Though I fear not God nor
				   regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her,
				   lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what
				   the unjust judge saith." <reference osisRef="Luke.6.5">Luke 6:5</reference>, etc. "And he said unto them, Which
				   of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say
				   unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his
				   journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? And he
				   from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut,
				   and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say
				   unto you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his
				   friend, yet because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as
				   many as he needeth." He taught it in his own way of answering prayer,
				   as in answering the woman of Canaan, <reference osisRef="Matt.15.22">Matthew 15:22</reference>, etc. "And behold a
				   woman of Canaan came out of the coasts, and cried unto him, saying,
				   Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously
				   vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples
				   came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
				   But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
				   house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help
				   me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's
				   bread and cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat
				   of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. Then Jesus answered
				   and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as
				   thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour." And as
				   Christ prayed in his agony, so I have already mentioned several texts
				   of Scripture wherein we are directed to agonize in our prayers to God.
				</p><p>
				   2. These earnest prayers and strong cries of Christ to the Father in
				   his agony, show the greatness of his love to sinners. For, as has been
				   shown, these strong cries of Jesus Christ were what he offered up to
				   God as a public person, in the capacity of high priest, and in the
				   behalf of those whose priest he was. When he offered up his sacrifice
				   for sinners whom he had loved from eternity, he withal offered up
				   earnest prayers. His strong cries, his tears, and his blood, were all
				   offered up together to God, and they were all offered up for the same
				   end, for the glory of God in the salvation of the elect. They were all
				   offered up for the same persons, viz. for his people. For them he shed
				   his blood and that bloody sweat, when it fell down in clotted lumps to
				   the ground; and for them he so earnestly cried to God at the same time.
				   It was that the will of God might be done in the success of his
				   sufferings, in the success of that blood, in the salvation of those for
				   whom that blood was shed, and therefore this strong crying shows his
				   strong love; it shows how greatly he desired the salvation of sinners.
				   He cried to God that he might not sink and fail in that great
				   undertaking, because if he did so, sinners could not be saved, but all
				   must perish. He prayed that he might get the victory over death,
				   because if he did not get the victory, his people could never obtain
				   that victory, and they can conquer no otherwise than by his conquest.
				   If the Captain of our salvation had not conquered in this sore
				   conflict, none of us could have conquered, but we must have all sunk
				   with him. He cried to God that he might be saved from death, and if he
				   had not been saved from death in his resurrection, none of us could
				   ever have been saved from death. It was a great sight to see Christ in
				   that great conflict that he was in in his agony, but every thing in it
				   was from love, that strong love that was in his heart. His tears that
				   flowed from his eyes were from love; his great sweat was from love; his
				   blood, his prostrating himself on the ground before the Father, was
				   from love; his earnest crying to God was from the strength and ardency
				   of his love. It is looked upon as one principal way wherein true love
				   and good will is shown in christian friends one towards another,
				   heartily to pray one for another; and it is one way wherein Christ
				   directs us to show our love to our enemies, even praying for them.
				   <reference osisRef="Matt.5.44">Matthew 5:44</reference>. "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that
				   curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute
				   you." But was there ever any prayer that manifested love to enemies to
				   such a degree, as those strong cries and tears of the Son of God for
				   the success of his blood in the salvation of his enemies; the strife
				   and conflict of whose soul in prayer was such as to produce his agony
				   and his bloody sweat?
				</p><p>
				   3. If Christ was thus earnest in prayer to God, that the end of his
				   sufferings might be obtained in the salvation of sinners, then how much
				   ought those sinners to be reproved that do not earnestly seek their own
				   salvation! If Christ offered up such strong cries for sinners as their
				   high priest, that bought their salvation, who stood in no need of
				   sinners, who had been happy from all eternity without them, and could
				   not be made happier by them; then how great is the sottishness of those
				   sinners that seek their own salvation in a dull and lifeless manner;
				   that content themselves with a formal attendance on the duties of
				   religion, with their hearts in the mean time much more earnestly set
				   after other things! They after a sort attend on the duty of social
				   prayer, wherein they pray to God that he would have mercy on them and
				   save them; but after what a poor dull way is it that they do it! they
				   do not apply their heart unto wisdom, nor incline their ear to
				   understanding; they do not cry after wisdom, nor lift up their voice
				   for understanding; they do not seek it as silver, nor search for it as
				   for hidden treasures. Christ's earnest cries in his agony may convince
				   us that it was not without reason that he insisted upon it, in <reference osisRef="Luke.13.24">Luke 13:24</reference>. that we should strive to enter in at the strait gate, which, as
				   I have already observed to you, is, in the original, Agwnizesqe,
				   "Agonize to enter in at the strait gate." If sinners would be in a
				   hopeful way to obtain their salvation, they should agonize in that
				   great concern as men that are taking a city by violence, as <reference osisRef="Matt.11.12">Matthew 11:12</reference>. "And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
				   heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force." When a
				   body of resolute soldiers are attempting to take a strong city in which
				   they meet with great opposition, what violent conflicts are there
				   before the city is taken! How do the soldiers press on against the very
				   mouths of the enemies' cannon, and upon the points of their swords!
				   When the soldiers are scaling the walls, and making their first
				   entrance into the city, what a violent struggle is there between them
				   and their enemies that strive to keep them out! How do they, as it
				   were, agonize with all their strength! So ought we to seek our
				   salvation, if we would be in a likely way to obtain it. How great is
				   the folly then of those who content themselves with seeking with a cold
				   and lifeless frame of spirit, and so continue from month to month, and
				   from year to year, and yet flatter themselves that they shall be
				   successful!
				</p><p>
				   How much more still are they to be reproved, who are not in a way of
				   seeking their salvation at all, but wholly neglect their precious
				   souls, and attend the duties of religion no further than is just
				   necessary to keep up their credit among men; and instead of pressing
				   into the kingdom of God, are rather violently pressing on towards their
				   own destruction and ruin, being hurried on by their many head strong
				   lusts, as the herd of swine were hurried on by the legion of devils,
				   and ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the
				   waters! <reference osisRef="Matt.8.32">Matthew 8:32</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   4. From what has been said under this proposition, we may learn after
				   what manner Christians ought to go through the work that is before
				   them. Christ had a great work before him when that took place, of which
				   we have an account in the text. Though it was very near the close of
				   his life, yet he then, when his agony began, had the chief part of the
				   work before him that he came into the world to do; which was to offer
				   up that sacrifice which he offered in his last sufferings, and therein
				   to perform the greatest act of his obedience to God. And so the
				   Christians have a great work to do, a service they are to perform to
				   God, that is attended with great difficulty. They have a race set
				   before them that they have to run, a warfare that is appointed them.
				   Christ was the subject of a very great trial in the time of his agony;
				   so God is wont to exercise his people with great trials. Christ met
				   with great opposition in that work that he had to do; so believers are
				   like to meet with great opposition in running the race that is set
				   before them. Christ, as man, had a feeble nature, that was in itself
				   very insufficient to sustain such a conflict, or to support such a load
				   as was coming upon him. So the saints have the same weak human nature,
				   and beside that, great sinful infirmities that Christ had not, which
				   lay them under great disadvantages, and greatly enhance the difficulty
				   of their work. Those great tribulations and difficulties that were
				   before Christ, were the way in which he was to enter into the kingdom
				   of heaven; so his followers must expect, "through much tribulation to
				   enter into the kingdom of heaven." The cross was to Christ the way to
				   the crown of glory, and so it is to his disciples. The circumstances of
				   Christ and of his followers in those things are alike, their case,
				   therefore, is the same; and therefore Christ's behaviour under those
				   circumstances, was a fit example for them to follow. They should look
				   to their Captain, and observe after what manner he went through his
				   great work, and the great tribulations which he endured. They should
				   observe after what manner he entered into the kingdom of heaven, and
				   obtained the crown of glory, and so they also should run the race that
				   is set before them. "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with
				   so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the
				   sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the
				   race that is set before us. Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher
				   of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him, endured the
				   cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
				   throne of God." Particularly,
				</p><p>
				   (1.) When others are asleep they should be awake, as it was with
				   Christ. The time of Christ's agony was the night season, the time
				   wherein persons were wont to be asleep: it was the time wherein the
				   disciples that were about Christ were asleep; but Christ then had
				   something else to do than to sleep; he had a great work to do; he kept
				   awake, with his heart engaged in this work. So should it be with the
				   believers of Christ; when the souls of their neighbours are asleep in
				   their sins, and under the power of a lethargic insensibility and sloth,
				   they should watch and pray, and maintain a lively sense of the infinite
				   importance of their spiritual concerns. <reference osisRef="1Thess.5.6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</reference>. "Therefore let us
				   not sleep, as do others, but let us watch and be sober."
				</p><p>
				   (2.) They should go through their work with earnest labour, as Christ
				   did. The time when others were asleep was a time when Christ was about
				   his great work, and was engaged in it with all his might, agonizing in
				   it; conflicting and wrestling, in tears, and in blood. So should
				   Christians with the utmost earnestness improve their time with souls
				   engaged in this work, pushing through the opposition they meet with in
				   it, pushing through all difficulties and sufferings there are in the
				   way, running with patience the race set before them, conflicting with
				   the enemies of their souls with all their might; as those that wrestle
				   not with flesh and blood, but with principalities and powers, and the
				   rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high
				   places.
				</p><p>
				   (3.) This labour and strife should be, that God may be glorified, and
				   their own eternal happiness obtained in a way of doing God's will. Thus
				   it was with Christ: what he so earnestly strove for was, that he might
				   do the will of God, that he might keep his command, his difficult
				   command, without failing in it, and that in this way God's will might
				   be done, in that glory to his ever great name, and that salvation to
				   his elect that he intended by his sufferings. Here is an example for
				   the saints to follow in that holy strife, and race, and warfare, which
				   God has appointed them; they should strive to do the will of their
				   heavenly Father, that they may, as the apostle expresses it, <reference osisRef="Rom.12.2">Romans 12:2</reference>.
				   "Prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God," and
				   that in this way they may glorify God, and may come at last to be happy
				   for ever in the enjoyment of God.
				</p><p>
				   (4.) In all the great work they have to do, their eye should be to God
				   for his help to enable them to overcome. Thus did the man Christ Jesus:
				   he strove in his work even to such an agony and bloody sweat. But how
				   did he strive? It was not in his own strength, but his eyes were to
				   God, he cries unto him for his help and strength to uphold him, that he
				   might not fail; he watched and prayed, as he desired his disciples to
				   do; he wrestled with his enemies and with his great sufferings, but at
				   the same time wrestled with God to obtain his help, to enable him to
				   get the victory. Thus the saints should use their strength in their
				   christian course to the utmost, but not as depending on their own
				   strength, but crying mightily to God for his strength to make them
				   conquerors.
				</p><p>
				   (5.) In this way they should hold out to the end as Christ did. Christ
				   in this way was successful, and obtained the victory, and won the
				   prize; he overcame, and is set down with the Father in his throne. So
				   Christians should persevere and hold out in their great work to the
				   end; they should continue to run their race till they have come to the
				   end of it; they should be faithful unto the death as Christ was; and
				   then, when they have overcome, they shall sit down with him in his
				   throne. <reference osisRef="Rev.3.21">Revelation of John 3:21</reference>. "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me
				   in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father
				   in his throne."
				</p><p>
				   5. Hence burdened and distressed sinners, if any such are here present,
				   may have abundant ground of encouragement to come to Christ for
				   salvation. Here is great encouragement to sinners to come to this high
				   priest that offered up such strong crying and tears with his blood, for
				   the success of his sufferings in the salvation of sinners. For,
				</p><p>
				   1st, Here is great ground of assurance that Christ stands ready to
				   accept of sinners, and bestow salvation upon them; for those strong
				   cries of his that he offered up in the capacity of our high priest,
				   show how earnestly desirous he was of it. If he was not willing that
				   sinners should be saved, be they ever so unworthy of it, then why would
				   he so wrestle with God for it in such a bloody sweat? Would any one so
				   earnestly cry to God with such costly cries, in such great labour and
				   travail of soul, for that, that he did not desire that God should
				   bestow? No, surely! but this shows how greatly his heart was set on the
				   success of his redemption; and therefore since he has by such earnest
				   prayers, and by such a bloody sweat, obtained salvation of the Father
				   to bestow on sinners, he will surely be ready to bestow it upon them,
				   if they come to him for it; otherwise he will frustrate his own design;
				   and he that so earnestly cried to God that his design might not be
				   frustrated, will not, after all, frustrate it himself.
				</p><p>
				   2. Here is the strongest ground of assurance that God stands ready to
				   accept of all those that come to him for mercy through Christ, for this
				   is what Christ prayed for in those earnest prayers, whose prayers were
				   always heard, as Christ says, <reference osisRef="John.11.42">John 11:42</reference>. "And I knew that thou hearest
				   me always." And especially may they conclude, that heard their high
				   priest in those strong cries that he offered up with his blood, and
				   that especially on the following account.
				</p><p>
				   (1.) They were the most earnest prayers that ever were made. Jacob was
				   very earnest when he wrestled with God; and many others have wrestled
				   with God with many tears; yea, doubtless, many of the saints have
				   wrestled with God with such inward labour and strife as to produce
				   powerful effects on the body. But so earnest was Christ, so strong was
				   the labour and fervency of his heart, that he cried to God in a sweat
				   of blood; so that if any earnestness and importunity in prayer ever
				   prevailed with God, we may conclude that that prevailed.
				</p><p>
				   (2.) He who then prayed was the most worthy person that ever put up a
				   prayer. He had more worthiness than ever men or angels had in the sight
				   of God, according as by inheritance he has obtained a more excellent
				   name than they; for he was the only-begotten Son of God, infinitely
				   lovely in his sight, the Son in whom he declared once and again he was
				   well-pleased. He was infinitely near and dear to God, and had more
				   worthiness in his eyes ten thousand times than all men and angels put
				   together. And can we suppose any other than that such a person was
				   heard when he cried to God with such earnestness? Did Jacob, a poor
				   sinful man, when he had wrestled with God, obtain of God the name of
				   ISRAEL, and that encomium, that as a prince he had power with God, and
				   prevailed? And did Elijah, who was a man of like passions, and of like
				   corruptions with us, when he prayed, earnestly prevail on God to work
				   such great wonders? And shall not the only-begotten Son of God, when
				   wrestling with God in tears and blood, prevail, and have his request
				   granted him?
				</p><p>
				   Surely there is no room to suppose any such thing; and therefore, there
				   is no room to doubt whether God will bestow salvation on those that
				   believe in him, at his request.
				</p><p>
				   (3.) Christ offered up these earnest prayers with the best plea for an
				   answer that ever was offered to God, viz. his own blood; which was an
				   equivalent for the thing that he asked. He not only offered up strong
				   cries, but he offered them up with a price fully sufficient to purchase
				   the benefit he asked.
				</p><p>
				   (4.) Christ offered this price and those strong cries both together;
				   for at the same time that he was pouring out these earnest requests for
				   the success of his redemption in the salvation of sinners, he also shed
				   his blood. His blood fell down to the ground at the same instant that
				   his cries went up to heaven. Let burdened and distressed sinners, that
				   are ready to doubt of the efficacy of Christ's intercession for such
				   unworthy creatures as they, and to call in question God's readiness to
				   accept them for Christ's sake, consider these things. Go to the garden
				   where the Son of God was in an agony, and where he cried to God so
				   earnestly, and where his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood,
				   and then see what a conclusion you will draw up from such a wonderful
				   sight.
				</p><p>
				   6. The godly may take great comfort in this, that Christ has as their
				   high priest offered up such strong cries to God. You that have good
				   evidence of your being believers in Christ, and his true followers and
				   servants, may comfort yourselves in this, that Christ Jesus is your
				   high priest, that that blood, which Christ shed in his agony, fell down
				   to the ground for you, and that those earnest cries were sent up to God
				   for you, for the success of his labours and sufferings in all that good
				   you stood in need of in this world, and in your everlasting happiness
				   in the world to come. This may be a comfort to you in all losses, and
				   under all difficulties, that you may encourage your faith, and
				   strengthen your hope, and cause you greatly to rejoice. If you were
				   under any remarkable difficulties, it would be a great comfort to you
				   to have the prayers of some man that you looked upon to be a man of
				   eminent piety, and one that had a great interest at the throne of
				   grace, and especially if you knew that he was very earnest and greatly
				   engaged in prayer for you. But how much more may you be comforted in
				   it, that you have an interest in the prayers and cries of the
				   only-begotten and infinitely worthy Son of God, and that he was so
				   earnest in his prayers for you, as you have heard!
				</p><p>
				   7. Hence we may learn how earnest Christians ought to be in their
				   prayers and endeavours for the salvation of others. Christians are the
				   followers of Christ, and they should follow him in this. We see from
				   what we have heard, how great the labour and travail of Christ's soul
				   was for others' salvation, and what earnest and strong cries to God
				   accompanied his labours. Here he hath set us an example. Herein he hath
				   set an example for ministers, who should as co-workers with Christ
				   travail in birth with them till Christ be found in them. <reference osisRef="Gal.4.19">Galatians 4:19</reference>. "My
				   little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be
				   formed in you." They should be willing to spend and be spent for them.
				   They should not only labour for them, and pray earnestly for them, but
				   should, if occasion required, be ready to suffer for them, and to spend
				   not only their strength, but their blood for them. <reference osisRef="2Cor.12.15">2 Corinthians 12:15</reference>. "And I
				   will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the more abundantly
				   I love you, the less I be loved." Here is an example for parents,
				   showing how they ought to labour and cry to God for the spiritual good
				   of their children. You see how Christ laboured and strove and cried to
				   God for the salvation of his spiritual children; and will not you
				   earnestly seek and cry to God for your natural children?
				</p><p>
				   Here is an example for neighbours one towards another how they should
				   seek and cry for the good of one another's souls, for this is the
				   command of Christ, that they should love one another as Christ loved
				   them. <reference osisRef="John.15.12">John 15:12</reference>. Here is an example for us, showing how we should
				   earnestly seek and pray for the spiritual and eternal good of our
				   enemies, for Christ did all this for his enemies, and when some of
				   those enemies were at that very instant plotting his death, and busily
				   contriving to satiate their malice and cruelty, in his most extreme
				   torments, and most ignominious destruction.

					A Sermon
				  by
				Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
				    Sermon IV of Seventeen Occasional Sermons, in The Works of Jonathan Edwards,
				    Volume Two, The Banner of Truth Trust, Reprinted 1995, pp. 849-854.
				</p><p>
				  <reference osisRef="Rom.9.18">Romans 9:18</reference> - Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
				  will he hardeneth.
				</p><p>
				   THE apostle, in the beginning of this chapter, expresses his great
				   concern and sorrow of heart for the nation of the Jews, who were
				   rejected of God. This leads him to observe the difference which God
				   made by election between some of the Jews and others, and between the
				   bulk of that people and the christian Gentiles. In speaking of this he
				   enters into a more minute discussion of the sovereignty of God in
				   electing some to eternal life, and rejecting others, than is found in
				   any other part of the Bible; in the course of which he quotes several
				   passages from the Old Testament, confirming and illustrating this
				   doctrine. In the ninth verse he refers us to what God said to Abraham,
				   showing his election of Isaac before Ishmael - "For this is the word of
				   promise; At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son:" then to
				   what God had said to Rebecca, showing his election of Jacob before
				   Esau; "The elder shall serve the younger:" in the thirteenth verse, to
				   a passage from Malachi, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated:" in
				   the fifteenth verse, to what God said to Moses, "I will have mercy on
				   whom I will have mercy; and I will have compassion on whom I will have
				   compassion:" and the verse preceding the text, to what God says to
				   Pharaoh, "For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same
				   purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and
				   that my name might be declared throughout all the earth." In what the
				   apostle says in the text, he seems to have respect especially to the
				   two last-cited passages: to what God said to Moses in the fifteenth
				   verse, and to what he said to Pharaoh in the verse immediately
				   preceding. God said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have
				   mercy." To this the apostle refers in the former part of the text. And
				   we know how often it is said of Pharaoh, that God hardened his heart.
				   And to this the apostle seems to have respect in the latter part of the
				   text; "and whom he will he hardeneth." We may observe in the text,
				</p><p>
				   1. God's different dealing with men. He hath mercy on some, and
				   hardeneth others. When God is here spoken of as hardening some of the
				   children of men, it is not to be understood that God by any positive
				   efficiency hardens any man's heart. There is no positive act in God, as
				   though he put forth any power to harden the heart. To suppose any such
				   thing would be to make God the immediate author of sin. God is said to
				   harden men in two ways: by withholding the powerful influences of his
				   Spirit, without which their hearts will remain hardened, and grow
				   harder and harder; in this sense he hardens them, as he leaves them to
				   hardness. And again, by ordering those things in his providence which,
				   through the abuse of their corruption, become the occasion of their
				   hardening. Thus God sends his word and ordinances to men which, by
				   their abuse, prove an occasion of their hardening. So the apostle said,
				   that he was unto some "a savour of death unto death." So God is
				   represented as sending Isaiah on this errand, to make the hearts of the
				   people fat, and to make their ears heavy, and to shut their eyes; lest
				   they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
				   understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. <reference osisRef="Isa.6.10">Isaiah 6:10</reference>.
				   Isaiah's preaching was, in itself, of a contrary tendency, to make them
				   better. But their abuse of it rendered it an occasion of their
				   hardening. As God is here said to harden men, so he is said to put a
				   lying spirit in the mouth of the false prophets. <reference osisRef="2Chr.18.22">2 Chronicles 18:22</reference>. That
				   is, he suffered a lying spirit to enter into them. And thus he is said
				   to have bid Shimei curse David. <reference osisRef="2Sam.16.10">2 Samuel 16:10</reference>. Not that he properly
				   commanded him; for it is contrary to God's commands. God expressly
				   forbids cursing the ruler of the people. <reference osisRef="Exod.22.28">Exodus 22:28</reference>. But he suffered
				   corruption at that time so to work in Shimei, and ordered that occasion
				   of stirring it up, as a manifestation of his displeasure against David.
				</p><p>
				   2. The foundation of his different dealing with mankind; viz. his
				   sovereign will and pleasure. "He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy,
				   and whom he will he hardeneth." This does not imply, merely, that God
				   never shows mercy or denies it against his will, or that he is always
				   willing to do it when he does it. A willing subject or servant, when he
				   obeys his lord's commands, may never do any thing against his will,
				   nothing but what he can do cheerfully and with delight; and yet he
				   cannot be said to do what he wills in the sense of the text. But the
				   expression implies that it is God's mere will and sovereign pleasure,
				   which supremely orders this affair. It is the divine will without
				   restraint, or constraint, or obligation.
				</p><p>
				   Doctrine. God exercises his sovereignty in the eternal salvation of
				   men.
				</p><p>
				   He not only is sovereign, and has a sovereign right to dispose and
				   order in that affair; and he not only might proceed in a sovereign way,
				   if he would, and nobody could charge him with exceeding his right; but
				   he actually does so; he exercises the right which he has. In the
				   following discourse, I propose to show,
				</p><p>
				   [38]I. [1] What is God's sovereignty.
				   [39]II. What God's sovereignty in the salvation of men implies.
				   [40]III. That God actually doth exercise his sovereignty in this
				   matter.
				   [41]IV. The reasons for this exercise.
				</p><p>
				   I. I would show what is God's sovereignty.
				</p><p>
				   The sovereignty of God is his absolute, independent right of disposing
				   of all creatures according to his own pleasure. I will consider this
				   definition by the parts of it.
				</p><p>
				   The will of God is called his mere pleasure,
				</p><p>
				   1. In opposition to any constraint. Men may do things voluntarily, and
				   yet there may be a degree of constraint. A man may be said to do a
				   thing voluntarily, that is, he himself does it; and, all things
				   considered, he may choose to do it; yet he may do it out of fear, and
				   the thing in itself considered be irksome to him, and sorely against
				   his inclination. When men do things thus, they cannot be said to do
				   them according to their mere pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   2. In opposition to its being under the will of another. A servant may
				   fulfil his master's commands, and may do it willingly, and cheerfully,
				   and may delight to do his master's will; yet when he does so, he does
				   not do it of his own mere pleasure. The saints do the will of God
				   freely. They choose to do it; it is their meat and drink. Yet they do
				   not do it of their mere pleasure and arbitrary will; because their will
				   is under the direction of a superior will.
				</p><p>
				   3. In opposition to any proper obligation. A man may do a thing which
				   he is obliged to do, very freely; but he cannot be said to act from his
				   own mere will and pleasure. He who acts from his own mere pleasure, is
				   at full liberty; but he who is under any proper obligation, is not at
				   liberty, but is bound. Now the sovereignty of God supposes, that he has
				   a right to dispose of all his creatures according to his mere pleasure
				   in the sense explained. And his right is absolute and independent. Men
				   may have a right to dispose of some things according to their pleasure.
				   But their right is not absolute and unlimited. Men may be said to have
				   a right to dispose of their own goods as they please. But their right
				   is not absolute; is has limits and bounds. They have a right to dispose
				   of their own goods as they please, provided they do not do it contrary
				   to the law of the state to which they are subject, or contrary to the
				   law of God. Men's right to dispose of their things as they will, is not
				   absolute, because it is not independent. They have not an independent
				   right to what they have, but in some things depend on the community to
				   which they belong, for the right they have; and in every thing depend
				   on God. They receive all the right they have to any thing from God. But
				   the sovereignty of God imports that he has an absolute, and unlimited,
				   and independent right of disposing of his creatures as he will. I
				   proposed to inquire,
				</p><p>
				   II. What God's sovereignty in the salvation of men implies. In answer
				   to this inquiry, I observe, it implies that God can either bestow
				   salvation on any of the children of men, or refuse it, without any
				   prejudice to the glory of any of his attributes, except where he has
				   been pleased to declare, that he will or will not bestow it. It cannot
				   be said absolutely, as the case now stands, that God can, without any
				   prejudice to the honour of any of his attributes, bestow salvation on
				   any of the children of men, or refuse it; because, concerning some, God
				   has been pleased to declare either that he will or that he will not
				   bestow salvation on them; and thus to bind himself by his own promise.
				   And concerning some he has been pleased to declare, that he never will
				   bestow salvation upon them; viz. those who have committed the sin
				   against the Holy Ghost. Hence, as the case now stands, he is obliged;
				   he cannot bestow salvation in one case, or refuse it in the other,
				   without prejudice to the honour of his truth. But God exercised his
				   sovereignty in making these declarations. God was not obliged to
				   promise that he would save all who believe in Christ; nor was he
				   obliged to declare, that he who committed the sin against the Holy
				   Ghost should never be forgiven. But it pleased him so to declare. And
				   had it not been so that God had been pleased to oblige himself in these
				   cases, he might still have either bestowed salvation, or refused it,
				   without prejudice to any of his attributes. If it would in itself be
				   prejudicial to any of his attributes to bestow or refuse salvation,
				   then God would not in that matter act as absolutely sovereign. Because
				   it then ceases to be a merely arbitrary thing. It ceases to be a matter
				   of absolute liberty, and is become a matter of necessity or obligation.
				   For God cannot do any thing to the prejudice of any of his attributes,
				   or contrary to what is in itself excellent and glorious. Therefore,
				</p><p>
				   1. God can, without prejudice to the glory of any of his attributes,
				   bestow salvation on any of the children of men, except on those who
				   have committed the sin against the Holy Ghost. The case was thus when
				   man fell, and before God revealed his eternal purpose and plan for
				   redeeming men by Jesus Christ. It was probably looked upon by the
				   angels as a thing utterly inconsistent with God's attributes to save
				   any of the children of men. It was utterly inconsistent with the honour
				   of the divine attributes to save any one of the fallen children of men,
				   as they were in themselves. It could not have been done had not God
				   contrived a way consistent with the honour of his holiness, majesty,
				   justice, and truth. But since God in the gospel has revealed that
				   nothing is too hard for him to do, nothing beyond the reach of his
				   power, and wisdom, and sufficiency; and since Christ has wrought out
				   the work of redemption, and fulfilled the law by obeying, there is none
				   of mankind whom he may not save without any prejudice to any of his
				   attributes, excepting those who have committed the sin against the Holy
				   Ghost. And those he might have saved without going contrary to any of
				   his attributes, had he not been pleased to declare that he would not.
				   It was not because he could not have saved them consistently with his
				   justice, and consistently with his law, or because his attribute of
				   mercy was not great enough, or the blood of Christ not sufficient to
				   cleanse from that sin. But it has pleased him for wise reasons to
				   declare that that sin shall never be forgiven in this world, or in the
				   world to come. And so now it is contrary to God's truth to save such.
				   But otherwise there is no sinner, let him be ever so great, but God can
				   save him without prejudice to any attribute; if he has been a murderer,
				   adulterer, or perjurer, or idolater, or blasphemer, God may save him if
				   he pleases, and in no respect injure his glory. Though persons have
				   sinned long, have been obstinate, have committed heinous sins a
				   thousand times, even till they have grown old in sin, and have sinned
				   under great aggravations: let the aggravations be what they may; if
				   they have sinned under ever so great light; if they have been
				   backsliders, and have sinned against ever so numerous and solemn
				   warnings and strivings of the Spirit, and mercies of his common
				   providence: though the danger of such is much greater than of other
				   sinners, yet God can save them if he pleases, for the sake of Christ,
				   without any prejudice to any of his attributes. He may have mercy on
				   whom he will have mercy. He may have mercy on the greatest of sinners,
				   if he pleases, and the glory of none of his attributes will be in the
				   least sullied. Such is the sufficiency of the satisfaction and
				   righteousness of Christ, that none of the divine attributes stand in
				   the way of the salvation of any of them. Thus the glory of any
				   attribute did not at all suffer by Christ's saving some of his
				   crucifiers.
				</p><p>
				   1. God may save any of them without prejudice to the honour of his
				   holiness. God is an infinitely holy being. The heavens are not pure in
				   his sight. He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on
				   iniquity. And if God should in any way countenance sin, and should not
				   give proper testimonies of his hatred of it, and displeasure at it, it
				   would be a prejudice to the honour of his holiness. But God can save
				   the greatest sinner without giving the least countenance to sin. If he
				   saves one, who for a long time has stood out under the calls of the
				   gospel, and has sinned under dreadful aggravations; if he saves one
				   who, against light, has been a pirate or blasphemer, he may do it
				   without giving any countenance to their wickedness; because his
				   abhorrence of it and displeasure against it have been already
				   sufficiently manifested in the sufferings of Christ. It was a
				   sufficient testimony of God's abhorrence against even the greatest
				   wickedness, that Christ, the eternal Son of God, died for it. Nothing
				   can show God's infinite abhorrence of any wickedness more than this. If
				   the wicked man himself should be thrust into hell, and should endure
				   the most extreme torments which are ever suffered there, it would not
				   be a greater manifestation of God's abhorrence of it, than the
				   sufferings of the Son of God for it.
				</p><p>
				   2. God may save any of the children of men without prejudice to the
				   honour of his majesty. If men have affronted God, and that ever so
				   much, if they have cast ever so much contempt on his authority; yet God
				   can save them, if he pleases, and the honour of his majesty not suffer
				   in the least. If God should save those who have affronted him, without
				   satisfaction, the honour of his majesty would suffer. For when contempt
				   is cast upon infinite majesty, its honour suffers, and the contempt
				   leaves an obscurity upon the honour of the divine majesty, if the
				   injury is not repaired. But the sufferings of Christ do fully repair
				   the injury. Let the contempt be ever so great, yet if so honourable a
				   person as Christ undertakes to be a Mediator for the offender, and in
				   the mediation suffer in his stead, it fully repairs the injury done to
				   the majesty of heaven by the greatest sinner.
				</p><p>
				   3. God may save any sinner whatsoever consistently with his justice.
				   The justice of God requires the punishment of sin. God is the Supreme
				   Judge of the world, and he is to judge the world according to the rules
				   of justice. It is not the part of a judge to show favour to the person
				   judged; but he is to determine according to a rule of justice without
				   departing to the right hand or left. God does not show mercy as a
				   judge, but as a sovereign. And therefore when mercy sought the
				   salvation of sinners, the inquiry was how to make the exercise of the
				   mercy of God as a sovereign, and of his strict justice as a judge,
				   agree together. And this is done by the sufferings of Christ, in which
				   sin is punished fully, and justice answered. Christ suffered enough for
				   the punishment of the sins of the greatest sinner that ever lived. So
				   that God, when he judges, may act according to a rule of strict
				   justice, and yet acquit the sinner, if he be in Christ. Justice cannot
				   require any more for any man's sins, than those sufferings of one of
				   the persons in the Trinity, which Christ suffered. <reference osisRef="Rom.3.25 Rom.3.26">Romans 3:25-26</reference>. "Whom
				   God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood; to
				   declare his righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of
				   him which believeth in Christ."
				</p><p>
				   4. God can save any sinner whatsoever, without any prejudice to the
				   honour of his truth. God passed his word, that sin should be punished
				   with death, which is to be understood not only of the first, but of the
				   second death. God can save the greatest sinner consistently with his
				   truth in this threatening. For sin is punished in the sufferings of
				   Christ, inasmuch as he is our surety, and so is legally the same
				   person, and sustained our guilt, and in his sufferings bore our
				   punishment. It may be objected, that God said, If thou eatest, thou
				   shalt die; as though the same person that sinned must suffer; and
				   therefore why does not God's truth oblige him to that? I answer, that
				   the word then was not intended to be restrained to him, that in his own
				   person sinned. Adam probably understood that his posterity were
				   included, whether they sinned in their own person or not. If they
				   sinned in Adam, their surety, those words, "if thou eatest," meant, if
				   thou eatest in thyself, or in thy surety. And therefore, the latter
				   words, "thou shalt die," do also fairly allow of such a construction
				   as, thou shalt die in thyself, or in thy surety. <reference osisRef="Isa.42.21">Isaiah 42:21</reference>. "The Lord
				   is well pleased for his righteousness' sake, he will magnify the law
				   and make it honourable." But,
				</p><p>
				   II. God may refuse salvation to any sinner whatsoever, without
				   prejudice to the honour of any of his attributes.
				</p><p>
				   There is no person whatever in a natural condition, upon whom God may
				   not refuse to bestow salvation without prejudice to any part of his
				   glory. Let a natural person be wise or unwise, of a good or ill natural
				   temper, of mean or honourable parentage, whether born of wicked or
				   godly parents; let him be a moral or immoral person, whatever good he
				   may have done, however religious he has been, how many prayers soever
				   he has made, and whatever pains he has taken that he may be saved;
				   whatever concern and distress he may have for fear he shall be damned;
				   or whatever circumstances he may be in; God can deny him salvation
				   without the least disparagement to any of his perfections. His glory
				   will not in any instance be the least obscured by it.
				</p><p>
				   1. God may deny salvation to any natural person without any injury to
				   the honour of his righteousness. If he does so, there is no injustice
				   nor unfairness in it. There is no natural man living, let his case be
				   what it will, but God may deny him salvation, and cast him down to
				   hell, and yet not be chargeable with the least unrighteous or unfair
				   dealing in any respect whatsoever. This is evident, because they all
				   have deserved hell: and it is no injustice for a proper judge to
				   inflict on any man what he deserves. And as he has deserved
				   condemnation, so he has never done any thing to remove the liability,
				   or to atone for the sin. He never has done any thing whereby he has
				   laid any obligations on God not to punish him as he deserved.
				</p><p>
				   2. God may deny salvation to any unconverted person whatever without
				   any prejudice to the honour of his goodness. Sinners are sometimes
				   ready to flatter themselves, that though it may not be contrary to the
				   justice of God to condemn them, yet it will not consist with the glory
				   of his mercy. They think it will be dishonourable to God's mercy to
				   cast them into hell, and have no pity or compassion upon them. They
				   think it will be very hard and severe, and not becoming a God of
				   infinite grace and tender compassion. But God can deny salvation to any
				   natural person without any disparagement to his mercy and goodness.
				   That, which is not contrary to God's justice, is not contrary to his
				   mercy. If damnation be justice, then mercy may choose its own object.
				   They mistake the nature of the mercy of God, who think that it is an
				   attribute, which, in some cases, is contrary to justice. Nay, God's
				   mercy is illustrated by it, as in the twenty-third verse of the
				   context. "That he might make known the riches of his glory on the
				   vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory."
				</p><p>
				   3. It is in no way prejudicial to the honour of God's faithfulness. For
				   God has in no way obliged himself to any natural man by his word to
				   bestow salvation upon him. Men in a natural condition are not the
				   children of promise; but lie open to the curse of the law, which would
				   not be the case if they had any promise to lay hold of.
				</p><p>
				   III. God does actually exercise his sovereignty in men's salvation.
				</p><p>
				   We shall show how he exercises this right in several particulars.
				</p><p>
				   1. In calling one people or nation, and giving them the means of grace,
				   and leaving others without them. According to the divine appointment,
				   salvation is bestowed in connexion with the means of grace. God may
				   sometimes make use of very unlikely means, and bestow salvation on men
				   who are under very great disadvantages; but he does not bestow grace
				   wholly without any means. But God exercises his sovereignty in
				   bestowing those means. All mankind are by nature in like circumstances
				   towards God. Yet God greatly distinguishes some from others by the
				   means and advantages which he bestows upon them. The savages, who live
				   in the remote parts of this continent, and are under the grossest
				   heathenish darkness, as well as the inhabitants of Africa, are
				   naturally in exactly similar circumstances towards God with us in this
				   land. They are no more alienated or estranged from God in their natures
				   than we; and God has no more to charge them with. And yet what a vast
				   difference has God made between us and them! In this he has exercised
				   his sovereignty. He did this of old, when he chose but one people, to
				   make them his covenant people, and to give them the means of grace, and
				   left all others, and gave them over to heathenish darkness and the
				   tyranny of the devil, to perish from generation to generation for many
				   hundreds of years. The earth in that time was peopled with many great
				   and mighty nations. There were the Egyptians, a people famed for their
				   wisdom. There were also the Assyrians and Chaldeans, who were great,
				   and wise, and powerful nations. There were the Persians, who by their
				   strength and policy subdued a great part of the world. There were the
				   renowned nations of the Greeks and Romans, who were famed over the
				   whole world for their excellent civil governments, for their wisdom and
				   skill in the arts of peace and war, and who by their military prowess
				   in their turns subdued and reigned over the world. Those were rejected.
				   God did not choose them for his people, but left them for many ages
				   under gross heathenish darkness, to perish for lack of vision; and
				   chose one only people, the posterity of Jacob, to be his own people,
				   and to give them the means of grace. <reference osisRef="Ps.147.19 Ps.147.20">Psalms 147:19-20</reference>. "He showeth his
				   word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath
				   not dealt so with any nation; and as for his judgments, they have not
				   known them." This nation were a small, inconsiderable people in
				   comparison with many other people. <reference osisRef="Deut.7.7">Deuteronomy 7:7</reference>. "The Lord did not set his
				   love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any
				   people; for ye were the fewest of all people." So neither was it for
				   their righteousness; for they had no more of that than other people.
				   <reference osisRef="Deut.9.6">Deuteronomy 9:6</reference>. "Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not
				   this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a
				   stiff-necked people." God gives them to understand, that it was from no
				   other cause but his free electing love, that he chose them to be his
				   people. That reason is given why God loved them; it was because he
				   loved them. <reference osisRef="Deut.7.8">Deuteronomy 7:8</reference>. Which is as much as to say, it was agreeable to
				   his sovereign pleasure, to set his love upon you.
				</p><p>
				   God also showed his sovereignty in choosing that people, when other
				   nations were rejected, who came of the same progenitors. Thus the
				   children of Isaac were chosen, when the posterity of Ishmael and other
				   sons of Abraham were rejected. So the children of Jacob were chosen,
				   when the posterity of Esau were rejected: as the apostle observes in
				   the seventh verse, "Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are
				   they all children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:" and again in
				   verses 10, 11, 12, 13. "And not only this; but when Rebekah also had
				   conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; the children moreover being
				   not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the promise of
				   God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that
				   calleth; it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it
				   is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." The apostle has
				   not respect merely to the election of the persons of Isaac and Jacob
				   before Ishmael and Esau; but of their posterity. In the passage,
				   already quoted from Malachi, God has respect to the nations, which were
				   the posterity of Esau and Jacob; <reference osisRef="Mal.1.2 Mal.1.3">Malachi 1:2-3</reference>. "I have loved you, saith
				   the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's
				   brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob; and I hated Esau, and laid
				   his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the
				   wilderness." God showed his sovereignty, when Christ came, in rejecting
				   the Jews, and calling the Gentiles. God rejected that nation who were
				   the children of Abraham according to the flesh, and had been his
				   peculiar people for so many ages, and who alone possessed the one true
				   God, and chose idolatrous heathen before them, and called them to be
				   his people. When the Messiah came, who was born of their nation, and
				   whom they so much expected, he rejected them. He came to his own, and
				   his own received him not. <reference osisRef="John.1.11">John 1:11</reference>. When the glorious dispensation of
				   the gospel came, God passed by the Jews, and called those who had been
				   heathens, to enjoy the privileges of it. They were broken off, that the
				   Gentiles might be graffed on. <reference osisRef="Rom.11.17">Romans 11:17</reference>. She is now called beloved,
				   that was not beloved. And more are the children of the desolate, than
				   the children of the married wife. <reference osisRef="Isa.54.1">Isaiah 54:1</reference>. The natural children of
				   Abraham are rejected, and God raises up children to Abraham of stones.
				   That nation, which was so honoured of God, have now been for many ages
				   rejected, and remain dispersed all over the world, a remarkable
				   monument of divine vengeance. And now God greatly distinguishes some
				   Gentile nations from others, and all according to his sovereign
				   pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   2. God exercises his sovereignty in the advantages he bestows upon
				   particular persons. All need salvation alike, and all are, naturally,
				   alike undeserving of it; but he gives some vastly greater advantages
				   for salvation than others. To some he assigns their place in pious and
				   religious families, where they may be well instructed and educated, and
				   have religious parents to dedicate them to God, and put up many prayers
				   for them. God places some under a more powerful ministry than others,
				   and in places where there are more of the outpourings of the Spirit of
				   God. To some he gives much more of the strivings and the awakening
				   influences of the Spirit, than to others. It is according to his mere
				   sovereign pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   3. God exercises his sovereignty in sometimes bestowing salvation upon
				   the low and mean, and denying it to the wise and great. Christ in his
				   sovereignty passes by the gates of princes and nobles, and enters some
				   cottage and dwells there, and has communion with its obscure
				   inhabitants. God in his sovereignty withheld salvation from the rich
				   man, who fared sumptuously every day, and bestowed it on poor Lazarus,
				   who sat begging at his gate. God in this way pours contempt on princes,
				   and on all their glittering splendour. So God sometimes passes by wise
				   men, men of great understanding, learned and great scholars, and
				   bestows salvation on others of weak understanding, who only comprehend
				   some of the plainer parts of Scripture, and the fundamental principles
				   of the christian religion. Yea, there seem to be fewer great men
				   called, than others. And God in ordering it thus manifests his
				   sovereignty. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.26 1Cor.1.27 1Cor.1.28">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</reference>. "For ye see your calling, brethren, how
				   that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
				   noble, are called. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world
				   to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world
				   to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world,
				   and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which
				   are not, to bring to nought things that are."
				</p><p>
				   4. In bestowing salvation on some who have had few advantages. God
				   sometimes will bless weak means for producing astonishing effects, when
				   more excellent means are not succeeded. God sometimes will withhold
				   salvation from those who are the children of very pious parents, and
				   bestow it on others, who have been brought up in wicked families. Thus
				   we read of a good Abijah in the family of Jeroboam, and of a godly
				   Hezekiah, the son of wicked Ahaz, and of a godly Josiah, the son of a
				   wicked Amon. But on the contrary, of a wicked Amnon and Absalom, the
				   sons of holy David, and that vile Manasseh, the son a good Hezekiah.
				   Sometimes some, who have had eminent means of grace, are rejected, and
				   left to perish, and others, under far less advantages, are saved. Thus
				   the scribes and Pharisees, who had so much light and knowledge of the
				   Scriptures, were mostly rejected, and the poor ignorant publicans
				   saved. The greater part of those, among whom Christ was much
				   conversant, and who heard him preach, and saw him work miracles from
				   day to day, were left; and the woman of Samaria was taken, and many
				   other Samaritans at the same time, who only heard Christ preach, as he
				   occasionally passed through their city. So the woman of Canaan was
				   taken, who was not of the country of the Jews, and but once saw Jesus
				   Christ. So the Jews, who had seen and heard Christ, and saw his
				   miracles, and with whom the apostles laboured so much, were not saved.
				   But the Gentiles, many of them, who, as it were, but transiently heard
				   the glad tidings of salvation, embraced them, and were converted.
				</p><p>
				   5. God exercises his sovereignty in calling some to salvation, who have
				   been very heinously wicked, and leaving others, who have been moral and
				   religious persons. The Pharisees were a very strict sect among the
				   Jews. Their religion was extraordinary. <reference osisRef="Luke.18.11">Luke 18:11</reference>. They were not as
				   other men, extortioners, unjust, or adulterers. There was their
				   morality. They fasted twice a week, and gave tithes of all that they
				   possessed. There was their religion. But yet they were mostly rejected,
				   and the publicans, and harlots, and openly vicious sort of people,
				   entered into the kingdom of God before them. <reference osisRef="Matt.21.31">Matthew 21:31</reference>. The apostle
				   describes his righteousness while a Pharisee. <reference osisRef="Phil.3.6">Philippians 3:6</reference>. "Touching
				   the righteousness which is of the law, blameless." The rich young man,
				   who came kneeling to Christ, saying, Good Master, what shall I do, that
				   I may have eternal life, was a moral person. When Christ bade him keep
				   the commandments, he said, and in his own view with sincerity, "All
				   these have I kept from my youth up." He had obviously been brought up
				   in a good family, and was a youth of such amiable manners and correct
				   deportment, that it is said, "Jesus beholding him, loved him." Still he
				   was left; while the thief, that was crucified with Christ, was chosen
				   and called, even on the cross. God sometimes shows his sovereignty by
				   showing mercy to the chief of sinners, on those who have been
				   murderers, and profaners, and blasphemers. And even when they are old,
				   some are called at the eleventh hour. God sometimes shows the
				   sovereignty of his grace by showing mercy to some, who have spent most
				   of their lives in the service of Satan, and have little left to spend
				   in the service of God.
				</p><p>
				   6. In saving some of those who seek salvation, and not others. Some who
				   seek salvation, as we know both from Scripture and observation, are
				   soon converted; while others seek a long time, and do not obtain at
				   last. God helps some over the mountains and difficulties which are in
				   the way; he subdues Satan, and delivers them from his temptations: but
				   others are ruined by the temptations with which they meet. Some are
				   never thoroughly awakened; while to others God is pleased to give
				   thorough convictions. Some are left to backsliding hearts; others God
				   causes to hold out to the end. Some are brought off from a confidence
				   in their own righteousness; others never get over that obstruction in
				   their way, as long as they live. And some are converted and saved, who
				   never had so great strivings as some who, notwithstanding, perish.
				</p><p>
				   IV. I come now to give the reasons, why God does thus exercise his
				   sovereignty in the eternal salvation of the children of men.
				</p><p>
				   1. It is agreeable to God's design in the creation of the universe to
				   exercise every attribute, and thus to manifest the glory of each of
				   them. God's design in the creation was to glorify himself, or to make a
				   discovery of the essential glory of his nature. It was fit that
				   infinite glory should shine forth; and it was God's original design to
				   make a manifestation of his glory, as it is. Not that it was his design
				   to manifest all his glory to the apprehension of creatures; for it is
				   impossible that the minds of creatures should comprehend it. But it was
				   his design to make a true manifestation of his glory, such as should
				   represent every attribute. If God glorified one attribute, and not
				   another, such manifestation of his glory would be defective; and the
				   representation would not be complete. If all God's attributes are not
				   manifested, the glory of none of them is manifested as it is: for the
				   divine attributes reflect glory on one another. Thus if God's wisdom be
				   manifested, and not his holiness, the glory of his wisdom would not be
				   manifested as it is; for one part of the glory of the attribute of
				   divine wisdom is, that it is a holy wisdom. So if his holiness were
				   manifested, and not his wisdom, the glory of his holiness would not be
				   manifested as it is; for one thing which belongs to the glory of God's
				   holiness is, that it is a wise holiness. So it is with respect to the
				   attributes of mercy and justice. The glory of God's mercy does not
				   appear as it is, unless it is manifested as a just mercy, or as a mercy
				   consistent with justice. And so with respect to God's sovereignty, it
				   reflects glory on all his other attributes. It is part of the glory of
				   God's mercy, that it is sovereign mercy. So all the attributes of God
				   reflect glory on one another. The glory of one attribute cannot be
				   manifested, as it is, without the manifestation of another. One
				   attribute is defective without another, and therefore the manifestation
				   will be defective. Hence it was the will of God to manifest all his
				   attributes. The declarative glory of God in Scripture is often called
				   God's name, because it declares his nature. But if his name does not
				   signify his nature as it is, or does not declare any attribute, it is
				   not a true name. The sovereignty of God is one of his attributes, and a
				   part of his glory. The glory of God eminently appears in his absolute
				   sovereignty over all creatures, great and small. If the glory of a
				   prince be his power and dominion, then the glory of God is his absolute
				   sovereignty. Herein appear God's infinite greatness and highness above
				   all creatures. Therefore it is the will of God to manifest his
				   sovereignty. And his sovereignty, like his other attributes, is
				   manifested in the exercises of it. He glorifies his power in the
				   exercise of power. He glorifies his mercy in the exercise of mercy. So
				   he glorifies his sovereignty in the exercise of sovereignty.
				</p><p>
				   2. The more excellent the creature is over whom God is sovereign, and
				   the greater the matter in which he so appears, the more glorious is his
				   sovereignty. The sovereignty of God in his being sovereign over men, is
				   more glorious than in his being sovereign over the inferior creatures.
				   And his sovereignty over angels is yet more glorious that his
				   sovereignty over men. For the nobler the creature is, still the greater
				   and higher doth God appear in his sovereignty over it. It is a greater
				   honour to a man to have dominion over men, that over beasts; and a
				   still greater honour to have dominion over princes, nobles, and kings,
				   than over ordinary men. So the glory of God's sovereignty appears in
				   that he is sovereign over the souls of men, who are so noble and
				   excellent creatures. God therefore will exercise his sovereignty over
				   them. And the further the dominion of any one extends over another, the
				   greater will be the honour. If a man has dominion over another only in
				   some instances, he is not therein so much exalted, as in having
				   absolute dominion over his life, and fortune, and all he has. So God's
				   sovereignty over men appears glorious, that it extends to every thing
				   which concerns them. He may dispose of them with respect to all that
				   concerns them, according to his own pleasure. His sovereignty appears
				   glorious, that it reaches their most important affairs, even the
				   eternal state and condition of the souls of men. Herein it appears that
				   the sovereignty of God is without bounds or limits, in that it reaches
				   to an affair of such infinite importance. God, therefore, as it is his
				   design to manifest his own glory, will and does exercise his
				   sovereignty towards men, over their souls and bodies, even in this most
				   important matter of their eternal salvation. He has mercy on whom he
				   will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.
				</p>
				<hi type="bold">APPLICATION.</hi>
				<p>
				   1. Hence we learn how absolutely we are dependent on God in this great
				   matter of the eternal salvation of our souls. We are dependent not only
				   on his wisdom to contrive a way to accomplish it, and on his power to
				   bring it to pass, but we are dependent on his mere will and pleasure in
				   the affair. We depend on the sovereign will of God for every thing
				   belonging to it, from the foundation to the top-stone. It was of the
				   sovereign pleasure of God, that he contrived a way to save any of
				   mankind, and gave us Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son, to be our
				   Redeemer. Why did he look on us, and send us a Saviour, and not the
				   fallen angels? It was from the sovereign pleasure of God. It was of his
				   sovereign pleasure what means to appoint. His giving us the Bible, and
				   the ordinances of religion, is of his sovereign grace. His giving those
				   means to us rather than to others, his giving the awakening influences
				   of his Spirit, and his bestowing saving grace, are all of his sovereign
				   pleasure. When he says, "Let there be light in the soul of such an
				   one," it is a word of infinite power and sovereign grace.
				</p><p>
				   2. Let us with the greatest humility adore the awful and absolute
				   sovereignty of God. As we have just shown, it is an eminent attribute
				   of the Divine Being, that he is sovereign over such excellent beings as
				   the souls of men, and that in every respect, even in that of their
				   eternal salvation. The infinite greatness of God, and his exaltation
				   above us, appears in nothing more, than in his sovereignty. It is
				   spoken of in Scripture as a great part of his glory. <reference osisRef="Deut.32.39">Deuteronomy 32:39</reference>. "See
				   now that I, even I, am he, and there is no God with me. I kill, and I
				   make alive; I wound, and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver
				   out of my hand." <reference osisRef="Ps.115.3">Psalms 115:3</reference>. "Our God is in the heavens; he hath done
				   whatsoever he pleased." <reference osisRef="Dan.4.34 Dan.4.35">Daniel 4:34-35</reference>. "Whose dominion is an
				   everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.
				   And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he
				   doeth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and among the
				   inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
				   What doest thou?" Our Lord Jesus Christ praised and glorified the
				   Father for the exercise of his sovereignty in the salvation of men.
				   <reference osisRef="Matt.11.25 Matt.11.26">Matthew 11:25-26</reference>. "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
				   because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
				   revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
				   sight." Let us therefore give God the glory of his sovereignty, as
				   adoring him, whose sovereign will orders all things, beholding
				   ourselves as nothing in comparison with him. Dominion and sovereignty
				   require humble reverence and honour in the subject. The absolute,
				   universal, and unlimited sovereignty of God requires, that we should
				   adore him with all possible humility and reverence. It is impossible
				   that we should go to excess in lowliness and reverence of that Being,
				   who may dispose of us to all eternity, as he pleases.
				</p><p>
				   3. Those who are in a state of salvation are to attribute it to
				   sovereign grace alone, and to give all the praise to him, who maketh
				   them to differ from others. Godliness is no cause for glorying, except
				   it be in God. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.29 1Cor.1.30 1Cor.1.31">1 Corinthians 1:29-31</reference>. "That no flesh should glory in his
				   presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
				   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. That,
				   according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
				   Lord." Such are not, by any means, in any degree to attribute their
				   godliness, their safe and happy state and condition, to any natural
				   difference between them and other men, or to any strength or
				   righteousness of their own. They have no reason to exalt themselves in
				   the least degree; but God is the being whom they should exalt. They
				   should exalt God the Father, who chose them in Christ, who set his love
				   upon them, and gave them salvation, before they were born, and even
				   before the world was. If they inquire, why God set his love on them,
				   and chose them rather than others, if they think they can see any cause
				   out of God, they are greatly mistaken. They should exalt God the Son,
				   who bore their names on his heart, when he came into the world, and
				   hung on the cross, and in whom alone they have righteousness and
				   strength. They should exalt God the Holy Ghost, who of sovereign grace
				   has called them out of darkness into marvellous light; who has by his
				   own immediate and free operation, led them into an understanding of the
				   evil and danger of sin, and brought them off from their own
				   righteousness, and opened their eyes to discover the glory of God, and
				   the wonderful riches of God in Jesus Christ, and has sanctified them,
				   and made them new creatures. When they hear of the wickedness of
				   others, or look upon vicious persons, they should think how wicked they
				   once were, and how much they provoked God, and how they deserved for
				   ever to be left by him to perish in sin, and that it is only sovereign
				   grace which has made the difference. <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.10">1 Corinthians 6:10</reference>. Many sorts of sinners
				   are there enumerated; fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate,
				   abusers of themselves with mankind. And then in the eleventh verse, the
				   apostle tells them, "Such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye
				   are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus,
				   and by the Spirit of our God." The people of God have the greater cause
				   of thankfulness, more reason to love God, who hath bestowed such great
				   and unspeakable mercy upon them of his mere sovereign pleasure.
				</p><p>
				   4. Hence we learn what cause we have to admire the grace of God, that
				   he should condescend to become bound to us by covenant; that he, who is
				   naturally supreme in his dominion over us, who is our absolute
				   proprietor, and may do with us as he pleases, and is under no
				   obligation to us; that he should, as it were, relinquish his absolute
				   freedom, and should cease to be merely sovereign in his dispensations
				   towards believers, when once they have believed in Christ, and should,
				   for their more abundant consolation, become bound. So that they can
				   challenge salvation of this Sovereign; they can demand it through
				   Christ, as a debt. And it would be prejudicial to the glory of God's
				   attributes, to deny it to them; it would be contrary to his justice and
				   faithfulness. What wonderful condescension is it in such a Being, thus
				   to become bound to us, worms of the dust, for our consolation! He bound
				   himself by his word, his promise. But he was not satisfied with that;
				   but that we might have stronger consolation still, he hath bound
				   himself by his oath. <reference osisRef="Heb.6.13">Hebrews 6:13</reference>, etc. "For when God made promise to
				   Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself;
				   saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will
				   multiply thee. And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
				   promise. For men verily swear by the greater; and an oath for
				   confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Wherein God, willing more
				   abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his
				   counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in
				   which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
				   consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
				   before us. Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
				   stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the
				   forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever
				   after the order of Melchisedec."
				</p><p>
				   Let us, therefore, labour to submit to the sovereignty of God. God
				   insists, that his sovereignty be acknowledged by us, and that even in
				   this great matter, a matter which so nearly and infinitely concerns us,
				   as our own eternal salvation. This is the stumbling-block on which
				   thousands fall and perish; and if we go on contending with God about
				   his sovereignty, it will be our eternal ruin. It is absolutely
				   necessary that we should submit to God, as our absolute sovereign, and
				   the sovereign over our souls; as one who may have mercy on whom he will
				   have mercy, and harden whom he will.
				</p><p>
				   5. And lastly. We may make use of this doctrine to guard those who seek
				   salvation from two opposite extremes - presumption and discouragement.
				   Do not presume upon the mercy of God, and so encourage yourself in sin.
				   Many hear that God's mercy is infinite, and therefore think, that if
				   they delay seeking salvation for the present, and seek it hereafter,
				   that God will bestow his grace upon them. But consider, that though
				   God's grace is sufficient, yet he is sovereign, and will use his own
				   pleasure whether he will save you or not. If you put off salvation till
				   hereafter, salvation will not be in your power. It will be as a
				   sovereign God pleases, whether you shall obtain it or not. Seeing,
				   therefore, that in this affair you are so absolutely dependent on God,
				   it is best to follow his direction in seeking it, which is to hear his
				   voice to-day: "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
				   heart." Beware also of discouragement. Take heed of despairing
				   thoughts, because you are a great sinner, because you have persevered
				   so long in sin, have backslidden, and resisted the Holy Ghost. Remember
				   that, let your case be what it may, and you ever so great a sinner, if
				   you have not committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, God can bestow
				   mercy upon you without the least prejudice to the honour of his
				   holiness, which you have offended, or to the honour of his majesty,
				   which you have insulted, or of his justice, which you have made your
				   enemy, or of his truth, or of any of his attributes. Let you be what
				   sinner you may, God can, if he pleases, greatly glorify himself in your
				   salvation.

					A Sermon<lb />

				</p><p>
				      [Preached on the Public Lecture in Boston, July 8, 1731; and published at
				      the desire of several ministers and others in Boston who heard it. - This
				      was the first piece published by Mr. Edwards.]
				</p><p>
				  <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.29 1Cor.1.30 1Cor.1.31">1 Corinthians 1:29-31</reference> - That no flesh should glory in his presence. But
				  of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and
				  righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is
				  written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
				</p><p>
				   THOSE Christians to whom the apostle directed this epistle, dwelt in a
				   part of the world where human wisdom was in great repute; as the
				   apostle observes in the 22nd verse of this chapter, "The Greeks seek
				   after wisdom." Corinth was not far from Athens, that had been for many
				   ages the most famous seat of philosophy and learning in the world. The
				   apostle therefore observes to them, how God by the gospel destroyed,
				   and brought to nought, their wisdom. The learned Grecians, and their
				   great philosophers, by all their wisdom did not know God, they were not
				   able to find out the truth in divine things. But, after they had done
				   their utmost to no effect, it pleased God at length to reveal himself
				   by the gospel, which they accounted foolishness. He " chose the foolish
				   things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the
				   world to confound the things which are mighty, and the base things of
				   the world, and things that are despised, yea, and things which are not,
				   to bring to nought the things that are." And the apostle informs them
				   in the text why he thus did, That no flesh should glory in his
				   presence, etc.- In which words may be observed,
				</p><p>
				   1. What God aims at in the disposition of things in the affair of
				   redemption, viz. that man should not glory in himself, but alone in
				   God; That no flesh should glory in his presence, -that, according as
				   it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
				</p><p>
				   2. How this end is attained in the work of redemption, viz. by that
				   absolute and immediate dependence which men have upon God in that work,
				   for all their good. Inasmuch as,
				</p><p>
				   First, All the good that they have is in and through Christ; He is made
				   unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. All the
				   good of the fallen and redeemed creature is concerned in these four
				   things, and cannot be better distributed than into them; but Christ is
				   each of them to us, and we have none of them any otherwise than in him.
				   He is made of God unto us wisdom: in him are all the proper good and
				   true excellency of the understanding. Wisdom was a thing that the
				   Greeks admired; but Christ is the true light of the world; it is
				   through him alone that true wisdom is imparted to the mind. It is in
				   and by Christ that we have righteousness: it is by being in him that we
				   are justified, have our sins pardoned, and are received as righteous
				   into God's favour. It is by Christ that we have sanctification: we have
				   in him true excellency of heart as well as of understanding; and he is
				   made unto us inherent as well as imputed righteousness. It is by Christ
				   that we have redemption, or the actual deliverance from all misery, and
				   the bestowment of all happiness and glory. Thus we have all our good by
				   Christ, who is God.
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, Another instance wherein our dependence on God for all our
				   good appears, is this, That it is God that has given us Christ, that we
				   might have these benefits through him; he of God is made unto us
				   wisdom, righteousness, etc.
				</p><p>
				   Thirdly, It is of him that we are in Christ Jesus, and come to have an
				   interest in him, and so do receive those blessings which he is made
				   unto us. It is God that gives us faith whereby we close with Christ.
				</p><p>
				   So that in this verse is shown our dependence on each person in the
				   Trinity for all our good. We are dependent on Christ the Son of God, as
				   he is our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We are
				   dependent on the Father, who has given us Christ, and made him to be
				   these things to us. We are dependent on the Holy Ghost, for it is of
				   him that we are in Christ Jesus; it is the Spirit of God that gives
				   faith in him, whereby we receive him,and close with him.
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">Doctrine.</hi>
				</p><p>
				   "God is glorified in the work of redemption in this, that there appears
				   in it so absolute and universal a dependence of the redeemed on him."
				   - Here I propose to show, 1st, That there is an absolute and universal
				   dependence of the redeemed on God for all their good. And, 2dly, That
				   God hereby is exalted and glorified in the work of redemption.
				</p><p>
				   I. There is an absolute and universal dependence of the redeemed on
				   God. The nature and contrivance of our redemption is such, that the
				   redeemed are in every thing directly, immediately, and entirely
				   dependent on God: they are dependent on him for all, and are dependent
				   on him every way.
				</p><p>
				   The several ways wherein the dependence of one being may be upon
				   another for its good, and wherein the redeemed of Jesus Christ depend
				   on God for all their good, are these, viz. That they have all their
				   good of him, and that they have all through him, and that they have all
				   in him: That he is the cause and original whence all their good comes,
				   therein it is of him; and that he is the medium by which it is obtained
				   and conveyed, therein they have it through him; and that he is the good
				   itself given and conveyed, therein it is in him. Now those that are
				   redeemed by Jesus Christ do, in all these respects, very directly and
				   entirely depend on God for their all.
				</p><p>
				   First, The redeemed have all their good of God. God is the great author
				   of it. He is the first cause of it; and not only so, but he is the only
				   proper cause. It is of God that we have our Redeemer. It is God that
				   has provided a Saviour for us. Jesus Christ is not only of God in his
				   person, as he is the only-begotten Son of God, but he is from God, as
				   we are concerned in him, and in his office of Mediator. He is the gift
				   of God to us: God chose and anointed him, appointed him his work, and
				   sent him into the world. And as it is God that gives, so it is God that
				   accepts the Saviour. He gives the purchaser, and he affords the thing
				   purchased.
				</p><p>
				   It is of God that Christ becomes ours, that we are brought to him, and
				   are united to him. It is of God that we receive faith to close with
				   him, that we may have an interest in him. <reference osisRef="Eph.2.8">Ephesians 2:8</reference>. "For by grace ye
				   are saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of
				   God." It is of God that we actually receive all the benefits that
				   Christ has purchased. It is God that pardons and justifies, and
				   delivers from going down to hell; and into his favour the redeemed are
				   received, when they are justified. So it is God that delivers from the
				   dominion of sin, cleanses us from our filthiness, and changes us from
				   our deformity. It is of God that the redeemed receive all their true
				   excellency, wisdom, and holiness; and that two ways, viz. as the Holy
				   Ghost by whom these things are immediately wrought is from God,
				   proceeds from him, and is sent by him; and also as the Holy Ghost
				   himself is God, by whose operation and indwelling the knowledge of God
				   and divine things, a holy disposition and all grace, are conferred and
				   upheld. And though means are made use of in conferring grace on men's
				   souls, yet it is of God that we have these means of grace, and it is he
				   that makes them effectual. It is of God that we have the Holy
				   Scriptures; they are his word. It is of God that we have ordinances,
				   and their efficacy depends on the immediate influence of his Spirit.
				   The ministers of the gospel are sent of God, and all their sufficiency
				   is of him.- <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.7">2 Corinthians 4:7</reference>. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels,
				   that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us." Their
				   success depends entirely and absolutely on the immediate blessing and
				   influence of God.
				</p><p>
				   1. The redeemed have all from the grace of God. It was of mere grace
				   that God gave us his only-begotten Son. The grace is great in
				   proportion to the excellency of what is given. The gift was infinitely
				   precious, because it was of a person infinitely worthy, a person of
				   infinite glory; and also because it was of a person infinitely near and
				   dear to God. The grace is great in proportion to the benefit we have
				   given us in him. The benefit is doubly infinite, in that in him we have
				   deliverance from an infinite, because an eternal, misery, and do also
				   receive eternal joy and glory. The grace in bestowing this gift is
				   great in proportion to our unworthiness to whom it is given; instead of
				   deserving such a gift, we merited infinitely ill of God's hands. The
				   grace is great according to the manner of giving, or in proportion to
				   the humiliation and expense of the method and means by which a way is
				   made for our having the gift. He gave him to dwell amongst us; he gave
				   him to us incarnate, or in our nature; and in the like though sinless
				   infirmities. He gave him to us in a low and afflicted state; and not
				   only so, but as slain, that he might be a feast for our souls.
				</p><p>
				   The grace of God in bestowing this gift is most free. It was what God
				   was under no obligation to bestow. He might have rejected fallen man,
				   as he did the fallen angels. It was what we never did any thing to
				   merit; it was given while we were yet enemies, and before we had so
				   much as repented. It was from the love of God who saw no excellency in
				   us to attract it; and it was without expectation of ever being requited
				   for it. And it is from mere grace that the benefits of Christ are
				   applied to such and such particular persons. Those that are called and
				   sanctified are to attribute it alone to the good pleasure of God's
				   goodness, by which they are distinguished. He is sovereign, and hath
				   mercy on whom he will have mercy.
				</p><p>
				   Man hath now a greater dependence on the grace of God than he had
				   before the fall. He depends on the free goodness of God for much more
				   than he did then. Then he depended on God's goodness for conferring the
				   reward of perfect obedience; for God was not obliged to promise and
				   bestow that reward. But now we are dependent on the grace of God for
				   much more; we stand in need of grace, not only to bestow glory upon us,
				   but to deliver us from hell and eternal wrath. Under the first covenant
				   we depended on God's goodness to give us the reward of righteousness;
				   and so we do now; but we stand in need of God's free and sovereign
				   grace to give us that righteousness; to pardon our sin, and release us
				   from the guilt and infinite demerit of it.
				</p><p>
				   And as we are dependent on the goodness of God for more now than under
				   the first covenant, so we are dependent on a much greater, more free
				   and wonderful goodness. We are now more dependent on God's arbitrary
				   and sovereign good pleasure. We were in our first estate dependent on
				   God for holiness. We had our original righteousness from him; but then
				   holiness was not bestowed in such a way of sovereign good pleasure as
				   it is now. Man was created holy, for it became God to create holy all
				   his reasonable creatures. It would have been a disparagement to the
				   holiness of God's nature, if he had made an intelligent creature
				   unholy. But now when fallen man is made holy, it is from mere and
				   arbitrary grace; God may for ever deny holiness to the fallen creature
				   if he pleases, without any disparagement to any of his perfections.
				</p><p>
				   And we are not only indeed more dependent on the grace of God, but our
				   dependence is much more conspicuous, because our own insufficiency and
				   helplessness in ourselves is much more apparent in our fallen and
				   undone state, than it was before we were either sinful or miserable. We
				   are more apparently dependent on God for holiness, because we are first
				   sinful,and utterly polluted,and afterward holy. So the production of
				   the effect is sensible, and its derivation from God more obvious. If
				   man was ever holy and always was so,it would not be so apparent, that
				   he had not holiness necessarily,as an inseparable qualification of
				   human nature. So we are more apparently dependent on free grace for the
				   favour of God, for we are first justly the objects of his displeasure,
				   and afterwards are received into favour. We are more apparently
				   dependent on God for happiness, being first miserable, and afterwards
				   happy. It is more apparently free and without merit in us, because we
				   are actually without any kind of excellency to merit, if there could be
				   any such thing as merit in creature excellency. And we are not only
				   without any true excellency, but are full of, and wholly defiled with,
				   that which is infinitely odious. All our good is more apparently from
				   God, because we are first naked and wholly with- out any good, and
				   afterwards enriched with all good.
				</p><p>
				   2. We receive all from the power of God. Man's redemption is often
				   spoken of as a work of wonderful power as well as grace. The great
				   power of God appears in bringing a sinner from his low state, from the
				   depths of sin and misery, to such an exalted state of holiness and
				   happiness. <reference osisRef="Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:19</reference>. "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power
				   to us- ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
				   power."--
				</p><p>
				   We are dependent on God's power through every step of our redemption.
				   We are dependent on the power of God to convert us, and give faith in
				   Jesus Christ, and the new nature. It is a work of creation: "If any man
				   be in Christ, he is a new creature," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.17">2 Corinthians 5:17</reference>. "We are created in
				   Christ Jesus," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.10">Ephesians 2:10</reference>. The fallen creature cannot attain to true
				   holiness, but by being created again. <reference osisRef="Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:24</reference>. "And that ye put on
				   the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
				   holiness." It is a raising from the dead. <reference osisRef="Col.2.12 Col.2.13">Colossians 2:12-13</reference>. "Wherein also
				   ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who
				   hath raised him from the dead." Yea, it is a more glorious work of
				   power than mere creation, or raising a dead body to life, in that the
				   effect attained is greater and more excellent. That holy and happy
				   being, and spiritual life, which is produced in the work of conversion,
				   is a far greater and more glorious effect, than mere being and life.
				   And the state from whence the change is made - a death in sin, a total
				   corruption of nature, and depth of misery - is far more remote from
				   the state attained, than mere death or non-entity.
				</p><p>
				   It is by God's power also that we are preserved in a state of grace. <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.5">1 Peter 1:5</reference>. "Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto
				   salvation." As grace is at first from God, so it is continually from
				   him, and is maintained by him, as much as light in the atmosphere is
				   all day long from the sun, as well as at first dawning, or sun-rising.
				   - Men are dependent on the power of God for every exercise of grace,
				   and for carrying on that work in the heart, for subduing sin and
				   corruption, increasing holy principles, and enabling to bring forth
				   fruit in good works. Man is dependent on divine power in bringing grace
				   to its perfection, m making the soul completely amiable in Christ's
				   glorious likeness, and filling of it with a satisfying joy and
				   blessedness; and for the raising of the body to life, and to such a
				   perfect state, that it shall be suitable for a habitation and organ for
				   a soul so perfected and blessed. These are the most glorious effects of
				   the power of God, that are seen in the series of God's acts with
				   respect to the creatures.
				</p><p>
				   Man was dependent on the power of God in his first estate, but he is
				   more dependent on his power now; he needs God's power to do more things
				   for him, and depends on a more wonderful exercise of his power. It was
				   an effect of the power of God to make man holy at the first: but more
				   remarkably so now, because there is a great deal of opposition and
				   difficulty in the way. It is a more glorious effect of power to make
				   that holy that was so depraved, and under the dominion of sin, than to
				   confer holiness on that which before had nothing of the contrary. It is
				   a more glorious work of power to rescue a soul out of the hands of the
				   devil, and from the powers of darkness, and to bring it into a state of
				   salvation, than to confer holiness where there was no prepossession or
				   opposition. <reference osisRef="Luke.11.21 Luke.11.22">Luke 11:21-22</reference>. "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace,
				   his goods are in peace; but when a stronger than he shall come upon
				   him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour, wherein he
				   trusted, and divideth his spoils." So it is a more glorious work of
				   power to uphold a soul in a state of grace and holiness, and to carry
				   it on till it is brought to glory, when there is so much sin remaining
				   in the heart resisting, and Satan with all his might opposing, than it
				   would have been to have kept man from falling at first, when Satan had
				   nothing in man.- Thus we have shown how the redeemed are dependent on
				   God for all their good, as they have all of him.
				</p><p>
				   Secondly, They are also dependent on God for all, as they have all
				   through him. God is the medium of it, as well as the author and
				   fountain of it. All we have, wisdom, the pardon of sin, deliverance
				   from hell, acceptance into God's favour, grace and holiness, true
				   comfort and happiness, eternal life and glory, is from God by a
				   Mediator; and this Mediator is God; which Mediator we have an absolute
				   dependence upon, as he through whom we receive all. So that here is
				   another way wherein we have our dependence on God for all good. God not
				   only gives us the Mediator, and accepts his mediation, and of his power
				   and grace bestows the things purchased by the Mediator; but he the
				   Mediator is God.
				</p><p>
				   Our blessings are what we have by purchase; and the purchase is made of
				   God, the blessings are purchased of him, and God gives the purchaser;
				   and not only so, but God is the purchaser. Yea God is both the
				   purchaser and the price; for Christ, who is God, purchased these
				   blessings for us, by offering up himself as the price of our salvation.
				   He purchased eternal life by the sacrifice of himself. <reference osisRef="Heb.7.27">Hebrews 7:27</reference>. "He
				   offered up himself." And 9:26. "He hath appeared to take away sin by
				   the sacrifice of himself." Indeed it was the human nature that was
				   offered; but it was the same person with the divine, and therefore was
				   an infinite price.
				</p><p>
				   As we thus have our good through God, we have a dependence on him in a
				   respect that man in his first estate had not. Man was to have eternal
				   life then through his own righteousness; so that he had partly a
				   dependence upon what was in himself; for we have a dependence upon that
				   through which we have our good, as well as that from which we have it;
				   and though man's righteousness that he then depended on was indeed from
				   God, yet it was his own, it was inherent in himself; so that his
				   dependence was not so immediately on God. But now the righteousness
				   that we are dependent on is not in ourselves, but in God. We are saved
				   through the righteousness of Christ: He is made unto us righteousness;
				   and therefore is prophesied of, <reference osisRef="Jer.23.6">Jeremiah 23:6</reference>, under that name, "the Lord
				   our righteousness." In that the righteousness we are justified by is
				   the righteousness of Christ, it is the righteousness of God. <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:21</reference>. "That we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
				   -Thus in redemption we have not only all things of God, but by and
				   through him, <reference osisRef="1Cor.8.6">1 Corinthians 8:6</reference>. "But to us there is but one God, the Father,
				   of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
				   whom are all things, and we by him."
				</p><p>
				   Thirdly, The redeemed have all their good in God. We not only have it
				   of him, and through him, but it consists in him; he is all our good.-
				   The good of the redeemed is either objective or inherent. By their
				   objective good, I mean that extrinsic object, in the possession and
				   enjoyment of which they are happy. Their inherent good is that
				   excellency or pleasure which is in the soul itself. With respect to
				   both of which the redeemed have all their good in God, or which is the
				   same thing, God him- self is all their good.
				</p><p>
				   1. The redeemed have all their objective good in God. God himself is
				   the great good which they are brought to the posses- sion and enjoyment
				   of by redemption. He is the highest good, and the sum of all that good
				   which Christ purchased. God is the inheritance of the saints; he is the
				   portion of their souls. God is their wealth and treasure, their food,
				   their Life, their dwelling- place, their ornament and diadem, and their
				   everlasting honour and glory. They have none in heaven but God; he is
				   the great good which the redeemed are received to at death, and which
				   they are to rise to at the end of the world. The Lord God is the light
				   of the heavenly Jerusalem; and is the "river of the water of life "
				   that runs, and "the tree of life that grows, in the midst of the
				   paradise of God." The glorious excellencies and beauty of God will be
				   what will for ever entertain the minds of the saints, and the love of
				   God will be their everlasting feast. The redeemed will indeed enjoy
				   other things; they will enjoy the angels, and will enjoy one another;
				   but that which they shall enjoy in the angels, or each other, or in any
				   thing else whatsoever that will yield them delight and happiness, will
				   be what shall be seen of God in them.
				</p><p>
				   2. The redeemed have all their inherent good in God. Inherent good is
				   twofold; it is either excellency or pleasure. These the redeemed not
				   only derive from God, as caused by him, but have them in him. They have
				   spiritual excellency and joy by a kind of participation of God. They
				   are made excellent by a communication of God's excellency. God puts his
				   own beauty, i.e. his beautiful likeness, upon their souls. They are
				   made partakers of the divine nature, or moral image of God, <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.4">2 Peter 1:4</reference>.
				   They are holy by being made partakers of God's holiness. <reference osisRef="Heb.12.10">Hebrews 12:10</reference>.
				   The saints are beautiful and blessed by a communication of God's
				   holiness and joy, as the moon and planets are bright by the sun's
				   light. The saint hath spiritual joy and pleasure by a kind of effusion
				   of God on the soul. In these things the redeemed have communion with
				   God; that is, they partake with him and of him.
				</p><p>
				   The saints have both their spiritual excellency and blessedness by the
				   gift of the Holy Ghost, and his dwelling in them. They are not only
				   caused by the Holy Ghost, but are in him as their principle. The Holy
				   Spirit becoming an inhabitant, is a vital principle in the soul. He,
				   acting in, upon, and with the soul, becomes a fountain of true holiness
				   and joy, as a spring is of water, by the exertion and diffusion of
				   itself. <reference osisRef="John.4.14">John 4:14</reference>. "But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
				   give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him,
				   shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
				   Compared with chap. 7:38-39. "He that believeth on me, as the Scripture
				   hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water; but this
				   spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive."
				   The sum of what Christ has purchased for us, is that spring of water
				   spoken of in the former of those places, and those rivers of living
				   water spoken of in the latter. And the sum of the blessings, which the
				   redeemed shall receive in heaven, is that river of water of life that
				   proceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb, <reference osisRef="Rev.22.1">Revelation of John 22:1</reference>. Which
				   doubtless signifies the same with those rivers of living water,
				   explained, <reference osisRef="John.7.38 John.7.39">John 7:38-39</reference>, which is elsewhere called the "river of God's
				   pleasures." Herein consists the fulness of good, which the saints
				   receive of Christ. It is by partaking of the Holy Spirit, that they
				   have communion with Christ in his fulness. God hath given the Spirit,
				   not by measure unto him; and they do receive of his fulness, and grace
				   for grace. This is the sum of the saints' inheritance; and there- fore
				   that little of the Holy Ghost which believers have in this world, is
				   said to be the earnest of their inheritance, <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.22">2 Corinthians 1:22</reference>. "Who hath
				   also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
				   And chap. 5:5. "Now he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing, is
				   God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit." And <reference osisRef="Eph.1.13 Eph.1.14">Ephesians 1:13-14</reference>. "Ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the
				   earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased
				   possession."
				</p><p>
				   The Holy Spirit and good things are spoken of in Scripture as the same;
				   as if the Spirit of God communicated to the soul, comprised all good
				   things, <reference osisRef="Matt.7.11">Matthew 7:11</reference>. "How much more shall your heavenly Father give good
				   things to them that ask him?" In Luke it is, chap. 11:13. "How much
				   more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
				   him?" This is the sum of the blessings that Christ died to procure, and
				   the subject of gospel-promises. <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13 Gal.3.14">Galatians 3:13-14</reference>. "He was made a curse for
				   us, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." The
				   Spirit of God is the great promise of the Father, <reference osisRef="Luke.24.49">Luke 24:49</reference>. "Behold,
				   I send the promise of my Father upon you." The Spirit of God therefore
				   is called "the Spirit of promise," Eph. 1:33. This promised thing
				   Christ received, and had given into his hand, as soon as he had
				   finished the work of our redemption, to bestow on all that he had
				   redeemed; <reference osisRef="Acts.2.13">Acts 2:13</reference>. "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted,
				   and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he
				   hath shed forth this, which ye both see and hear." So that all the
				   holiness and happiness of the redeemed is in God. It is in the
				   communications, indwelling, and acting of the Spirit of God. Holiness
				   and happiness is in the fruit, here and hereafter, because God dwells
				   in them, and they in God.
				</p><p>
				   Thus God has given us the Redeemer, and it is by him that our good is
				   purchased. So God is the Redeemer and the price; and he also is the
				   good purchased. So that all that we have is of God, and through him,
				   and in him. <reference osisRef="Rom.11.36">Romans 11:36</reference>. "For of him, and through him, and to him, or in
				   him, are all things." The same in the Greek that is here rendered to
				   him, is rendered in him, <reference osisRef="1Cor.8.6">1 Corinthians 8:6</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   II. God is glorified in the work of redemption by this means, viz. By
				   there being so great and universal a dependence of the redeemed on him.
				</p><p>
				   1. Man hath so much the greater occasion and obligation to notice and
				   acknowledge God's perfections and all-sufficiency. The greater the
				   creature's dependence is on God's perfections, and the greater concern
				   he has with them, so much the greater occasion has he to take notice of
				   them. So much the greater concern any one has with and dependence upon
				   the power and grace of God, so much the greater occasion has he to take
				   notice of that power and grace. So much the greater and more immediate
				   dependence there is on the divine holiness, so much the greater
				   occasion to take notice of and acknowledge that. So much the greater
				   and more absolute dependence we have on the divine perfections, as
				   belonging to the several persons of the Trinity, so much the greater
				   occasion have we to observe and own the divine glory of each of them.
				   That which we are most concerned with, is surely most in the way of our
				   observation and notice; and this kind of concern with any thing, viz.
				   dependence, does especially tend to command and oblige the attention
				   and observation. Those things that we are not much dependent upon, it
				   is easy to neglect; but we can scarce do any other than mind that which
				   we have a great dependence on. By reason of our so great dependence on
				   God, and his perfections, and in so many respects, he and his glory are
				   the more directly set in our view, which way soever we turn our eyes.
				</p><p>
				   We have the greater occasion to take notice of God's all-sufficiency,
				   when all our sufficiency is thus every way of him. We have the more
				   occasion to contemplate him as an infinite good, and as the fountain of
				   all good. Such a dependence on God demonstrates his all-sufficiency. So
				   much as the dependence of the creature is on God, so much the greater
				   does the creature's emptiness in himself appear; and so much the
				   greater the creature's emptiness, so much the greater must the fulness
				   of the Being be who supplies him. Our having all of God, shows the
				   fulness of his power and grace; our having all through him, shows the
				   fulness of his merit and worthiness; and our having all in him,
				   demonstrates his fulness of beauty, love, and happiness. And the
				   redeemed, by reason of the greatness of their dependence on God, have
				   not only so much the greater occasion, but obligation to contemplate
				   and acknowledge the glory and fulness of God. How unreasonable and
				   ungrateful should we be, if we did not acknowledge that sufficiency and
				   glory which we absolutely, immediately, and universally depend upon!
				</p><p>
				   2. Hereby is demonstrated how great God's glory is considered
				   comparatively, or as compared with the creature's. By the creature
				   being thus wholly and universally dependent on God, it appears that the
				   creature is nothing, and that God is all. Hereby it appears that God is
				   infinitely above us; that God's strength, and wisdom, and holiness, are
				   infinitely greater than ours. However great and glorious the creature
				   apprehends God to be, yet if he be not sensible of the difference
				   between God and him, so as to see that God's glory is great, compared
				   with his own, he will not be disposed to give God the glory due to his
				   name. If the creature in any respects sets himself upon a level with
				   God, or exalts himself to any competition with him, however he may
				   apprehend that great honour and profound respect may belong to God from
				   those that are at a greater distance, he will not be so sensible of its
				   being due from him. So much the more men exalt themselves, so much the
				   less will they surely be disposed to exalt God. It is certainly what
				   God aims at in the disposition of things in redemption, (if we allow
				   the Scriptures to be a revelation of God's mind,) that God should
				   appear full, and man in himself empty, that God should appear all, and
				   man nothing. It is God's declared design that others should not "glory
				   in his presence;" which implies that it is his design to advance his
				   own comparative glory. So much the more man "glories in God's
				   presence," so much the less glory is ascribed to God.
				</p><p>
				   3. By its being thus ordered, that the creature should have so absolute
				   and universal a dependence on God, provision is made that God should
				   have our whole souls, and should be the object of our undivided
				   respect. If we had our dependence partly on God, and partly on
				   something else, man's respect would be divided to those different
				   things on which he had dependence. Thus it would be if we depended on
				   God only for a part of our good, and on ourselves, or some other being,
				   for another part: or if we had our good only from God, and through
				   another that was not God, and in something else distinct from both, our
				   hearts would be divided between the good itself, and him from whom, and
				   him through whom, we received it. But now there is no occasion for
				   this, God being not only he from or of whom we have all good, but also
				   through whom, and is that good itself, that we have from him and
				   through him. So that whatsoever there is to attract our respect, the
				   tendency is still directly towards God; all unites in him as the
				   centre.
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">USE.</hi>
				</p><p>
				   1. We may here observe the marvellous wisdom of God, in the work of
				   redemption. God hath made man's emptiness and misery, his low, lost,
				   and ruined state, into which he sunk by the fall, an occasion of the
				   greater advancement of his own glory, as in other ways, so particularly
				   in this, that there is now much more universal and apparent dependence
				   of man on God. Though God be pleased to lift man out of that dismal
				   abyss of sin and woe into which he was fallen, and exceedingly to exalt
				   him in excellency and honour, and to a high pitch of glory and
				   blessedness, yet the creature hath nothing in any respect to glory of;
				   all the glory evidently belongs to God, all is in a mere, and most
				   absolute, and divine dependence on the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And
				   each person of the Trinity is equally glorified in this work: there is
				   an absolute dependence of the creature on every one for all: all is of
				   the Father, all through the Son, and all in the Holy Ghost. Thus God
				   appears in the work of redemption as all in all. It is fit that he who
				   is, and there is none else, should be the Alpha and Omega, the first
				   and the last, the all and the only, in this work.
				</p><p>
				   2. Hence those doctrines and schemes of divinity that are in any
				   respect opposite to such an absolute and universal dependence on God,
				   derogate from his glory, and thwart the design of our redemption. And
				   such are those schemes that put the creature in God's stead, in any of
				   the mentioned respects, that exalt man into the place of either Father,
				   Son, or Holy Ghost, in any thing pertaining to our redemption. However
				   they may allow of a dependence of the redeemed on God, yet they deny a
				   dependence that is so absolute and universal. They own an entire
				   dependence of God for some things, but not for others; they own that we
				   depend on God for the gift and acceptance of a Redeemer, but deny so
				   absolute a dependence on him for the obtaining of an interest in the
				   Redeemer. They own an absolute dependence on the Father for giving his
				   Son, and on the Son for working out redemption, but not so entire a
				   dependence on the Holy Ghost for conversion, and a being in Christ, and
				   so coming to a title to his benefits. They own a dependence on God for
				   means of grace, but not absolutely for the benefit and success of those
				   means; a partial dependence on the power of God, for obtaining and
				   exercising holiness, but not a mere dependence on the arbitrary and
				   sovereign grace of God. They own a dependence on the free grace of God
				   for a reception into his favour, so far that it is without any proper
				   merit, but not as it is without being attracted, or moved with any
				   excellency. They own a partial dependence on Christ, as he through whom
				   we have life, as having purchased new terms of life, but still hold
				   that the righteousness through which we have life is inherent in
				   ourselves, as it was under the first covenant. Now whatever scheme is
				   inconsistent with our entire dependence on God for all, and of having
				   all of him, through him, and in him, it is repugnant to the design and
				   tenor of the gospel, and robs it of that which God accounts its lustre
				   and glory.
				</p><p>
				   3. Hence we may learn a reason why faith is that by which we come to
				   have an interest in this redemption; for there is included in the
				   nature of faith, a sensible acknowledgment of absolute dependence on
				   God in this affair. It is very fit that it should be required of all,
				   in order to their having the benefit of this redemption, that they
				   should be sensible of, and acknowledge, their dependence on God for it.
				   It is by this means that God hath contrived to glorify himself in
				   redemption; and it is fit that he should at least have this glory of
				   those that are the subjects of this redemption, and have the benefit of
				   it.- Faith is a sensibleness of what is real in the work of
				   redemption; and the soul that believes doth entirely depend on God for
				   all salvation, in its own sense and act. Faith abases men, and exalts
				   God; it gives all the glory of redemption to him alone. It is necessary
				   in order to saving faith, that man should be emptied of himself, be
				   sensible that he is "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
				   naked." Humility is a great ingredient of true faith: he that truly
				   receives redemption, receives it as a little child, <reference osisRef="Mark.10.15">Mark 10:15</reference>.
				   "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of heaven as a little child,
				   he shall not enter therein." It is the delight of a believing soul to
				   abase itself and exalt God alone: that is the language of it, <reference osisRef="Ps.115.1">Psalms 115:1</reference>. "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give glory."
				</p><p>
				   4. Let us be exhorted to exalt God alone, and ascribe to him all the
				   glory of redemption. Let us endeavour to obtain, and increase in, a
				   sensibleness of our great dependence on God, to have our eye to him
				   alone, to mortify a self-dependent and self-righteous disposition. Man
				   is naturally exceeding prone to exalt himself, and depend on his own
				   power or goodness; as though from himself he must expect happiness. He
				   is prone to have respect to enjoyments alien from God and his Spirit,
				   as those in which happiness is to be found.- But this doctrine should
				   teach us to exalt God alone; as by trust and reliance, so by praise.
				   Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord. Hath any man hope that he is
				   converted, and sanctified, and that his mind is endowed with true
				   excellency and spiritual beauty? that his sins are forgiven, and he
				   received into God's favour, and exalted to the honour and blessedness
				   of being his child, and an heir of eternal life? let him give God all
				   the glory; who alone makes him to differ from the worst of men in this
				   world, or the most miserable of the damned in hell. Hath any man much
				   comfort and strong hope of eternal life, let not his hope lift him up,
				   but dispose him the more to abase himself, to reflect on his own
				   exceeding unworthiness of such a favour,and to exalt God alone. Is any
				   man eminent in holiness, and abundant in good works, let him take
				   nothing of the glory of it to himself, but ascribe it to him whose
				   "workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus unto good works."

				<title>TRUE SAINTS, WHEN ABSENT FROM THE BODY, ARE PRESENT WITH THE LORD</title>

					Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
				   <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.8">2 Corinthians 5:8</reference> - We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be
				   absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
				</p><p>
				   THE apostle in this place is giving a reason why he went on with so
				   much boldness and immovable steadfastness, through such labors,
				   sufferings, and dangers of his life, in the service of his Lord; for
				   which his enemies, the false teachers among the Corinthians, sometimes
				   reproached him as being beside himself, and driven on by a kind of
				   madness. In the latter part of the preceding chapter, the apostle
				   informs the Christian Corinthians, that the reason why he did thus,
				   was, that he firmly believed the promises that Christ had made to his
				   faithful servants of a glorious future eternal reward, and knew that
				   these present afflictions were light, and but for a moment, in
				   comparison of that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The
				   same discourse is continued in this chapter; wherein the apostle
				   further insists on the reason he had given of his constancy in
				   suffering, and exposing himself to death in the work of the ministry,
				   even the more happy state he expected after death. And this is the
				   subject of the text; wherein may be observed,
				</p><p>
				    1. The great future privilege, which the apostle hoped for; that of
				       being present with Christ. The words, in the original, properly
				       signify dwelling with Christ, as in the same country or city, or
				       making a home with Christ.
				</p><p>
				    2. When the apostle looked for this privilege, viz., when he should be
				       absent from the body. Not to wait for it till the resurrection,
				       when soul and body should be united again. He signifies the same
				       thing in his epistle to the Philippians, chap. i. 22, 23: "But if I
				       live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor. Yet what I shall
				       choose, I wot not. For I am in a strait between two; having a
				       desire to depart, and to be with Christ."
				</p><p>
				    3. The value the apostle set on this privilege. It was such, that for
				       the sake of it, he chose to be absent from the body. He was willing
				       rather, or (as the word properly signifies) it were more pleasing
				       to him, to part with the present life, and all its enjoyments, and
				       be possessed of this great benefit, than to continue here.
				</p><p>
				    4. The present benefit, which the apostle had by his faith and hope of
				       this future privilege, and of his great value for it, viz., that
				       hence he received courage, assurance, and constancy of mind,
				       agreeable to the proper import of the word that is rendered, we are
				       confident. The apostle is now giving a reason of that fortitude and
				       immovable stability of mind, with which he went through those
				       extreme labors, hardships and dangers, which he mentions in this
				       discourse; so that, in the midst of all, he did not faint, was not
				       discouraged, but had constant light, and inward support, strength,
				       and comfort in the midst of all: agreeable to the 10th verse of the
				       foregoing chapter, "For which cause, we faint not; but though our
				       outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." And
				       the same is expressed more particularly in the 8th, 9th, and 10th
				       verses, of that chapter: "We are troubled on every side, yet not
				       distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but
				       not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in
				       the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
				       might be made manifest in our mortal flesh." And in the next
				       chapter, verses 4- 10: "In all things approving ourselves as the
				       ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities,
				       in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors,
				       in watchings, in fastings, by pureness, by knowledge, by
				       long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
				       by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of
				       righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and
				       dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet
				       true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we
				       live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway
				       rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and
				       yet possessing all things."
				</p><p>
				   Among the many useful observations there might be raised from the text,
				   I shall at this time only insist on that which lies most plainly before
				   us in the words, viz., this:
				</p><p>
				   The souls of true saints, when they leave their bodies at death, go to
				   be with Christ.
				</p><p>
				   Departed souls of saints go to be with Christ, in the following
				   respects:
				</p><p>
				    1. They go to dwell in the same blessed abode with the glorified human
				       nature of Christ.
				       The human nature of Christ is yet in being. He still continues, and
				       will continue to all eternity, to be both God and man. His whole
				       human nature remains: not only his human soul, but also his human
				       body. His dead body rose from the dead; and the same that was
				       raised from the dead, is exalted and glorified at God's right hand;
				       that which was dead is now alive, and lives for evermore.
				       And therefore there is a certain place, a particular part of the
				       external creation, to which Christ is gone, and where he remains.
				       And this place is that which we call the highest heaven, or the
				       heaven of heavens; a place beyond all the visible heavens. Eph. iv.
				       9, 10, "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
				       first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended, is the
				       same also that ascended up far above all heavens." This is the same
				       which the apostle calls the third heaven, 2 Cor. xii. 2, reckoning
				       the aerial heaven as the first, the starry heaven as the second,
				       and the highest heaven as the third. This is the abode of the holy
				       angels; they are called "the angels of heaven," Matt. xxiv. 36;
				       "The angels which are in heaven," Mark xiii. 32; "The angels of God
				       in heaven," Matt. xxii. 30, and Mark xii. 25. They are said "always
				       to behold the face of the Father which is in heaven," Matt. xviii,
				       10. And they are elsewhere often represented as before the throne
				       of God, or surrounding his throne in heaven, and sent from thence,
				       and descending from thence on messages to this world. And thither
				       it is that the souls of departed saints are conducted, when they
				       die. They are not reserved in some abode distinct from the highest
				       heaven; a place of rest, which they are kept in, till the day of
				       judgment; such as some imagine, which they call the hades of the
				       happy: but they go directly to heaven itself. This is the saints'
				       home, being their Father's house: they are pilgrims and strangers
				       on the earth, and this is the other and better country that they
				       are travelling to, Heb. xi. 13?26. This is the city they belong to:
				       Philip. iii. 20, "Our conversation or (as the word properly
				       signifies) citizenship, is in heaven." Therefore this undoubtedly
				       is the place the apostle has respect to in my text, when he
				       says,"We are willing to forsake our former house, the body, and to
				       dwell in the same house, city or country, wherein Christ dwells;"
				       which is the proper import of the words of the original. What can
				       this house, or city, or country be, but that house, which is
				       elsewhere spoken of, as their proper home, and their Father's
				       house, and the city and country to which they properly belong, and
				       whither they are travelling all the while they continue in this
				       world, and the house, city, and country where we know the human
				       nature of Christ is? This is the saints' rest; here their hearts
				       are while they live; and here their treasure is. "The inheritance
				       incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, that is
				       designed for them, is reserved in heaven," 1 Pet. i. 4; and
				       therefore they never can have their proper and full rest till they
				       come here. So that undoubtedly their souls, when absent from their
				       bodies (when the Scriptures represent them as in a state of perfect
				       rest), arrive hither. Those two saints, that left this world, to go
				       to their rest in another world, without dying, viz., Enoch and
				       Elijah, went to heaven. Elijah was seen ascending up to heaven, as
				       Christ was. And to the same resting place, is there all reason to
				       think, that those saints go, that leave the world, to go to their
				       rest, by death. Moses, when he died in the top of the mount,
				       ascended to the same glorious abode with Elias, who ascended
				       without dying. They are companions in another world; as they
				       appeared together at Christ's transfiguration. They were together
				       at that time with Christ in the mount, when there was a specimen or
				       sample of his glorification in heaven. And doubtless they were also
				       together afterwards, with him, when he was, actually, fully
				       glorified in heaven. And thither undoubtedly it was, that the soul
				       of Stephen ascended, when he expired. The circumstances of his
				       death demonstrate it, as we have an account of it, Acts vii. 55,
				       etc.: "He, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into
				       heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right
				       hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the
				       Son of man (i.e. Jesus, in his human nature) standing on the right
				       hand of God. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped
				       their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of
				       the city, and stoned him. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon
				       God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." Before his death
				       he had an extraordinary view of the glory that his Saviour had
				       received in heaven, not only for himself, but for him, and all his
				       faithful followers; that he might be encouraged, by the hopes of
				       this glory, cheerfully to lay down his life for his sake.
				       Accordingly he dies in the hope of this, saying, "Lord Jesus,
				       receive my spirit." By which doubtless he meant, "receive my spirit
				       to be with thee, in that glory, wherein I have now seen thee, in
				       heaven, at the right hand of God." And thither it was that the soul
				       of the penitent thief on the cross ascended. Christ said to him,
				       "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise." Paradise is the same
				       with the third heaven; as appears by 2 Cor. xii. 2, 3, 4. There
				       that which is called the third heaven in the 2d verse, in the 4th
				       verse is called paradise. The departed souls of the apostles and
				       prophets are in heaven; as is manifest from Rev. xviii. 20:
				       "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets."
				       The church of God is distinguished in Scripture, from time to time,
				       into these two parts; that part of it that is in heaven, and that
				       which is in earth; Eph. iii. 14, 15, "Jesus Christ, of whom the
				       whole family in heaven and earth is named." Col. i. 20, "And having
				       made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all
				       things to himself, by him, I say, whether they be things in earth
				       or things in heaven." Now what things in heaven are they for whom
				       peace has been made by the blood of Christ's cross, and who have by
				       him been reconciled to God, but the saints in heaven? In like
				       manner we read, Eph. i. 10, of God's gathering together in one all
				       things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth,
				       even in him." The spirits of just men made perfect are in the same
				       city of the living God, and heavenly Jerusalem, with the
				       innumerable company of angels, and Jesus the Mediator of the new
				       covenant; as is manifest by Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24. The church of God
				       is often in Scripture called by the name Jerusalem; and the apostle
				       speaks of the Jerusalem which is above, or which is in heaven, as
				       the mother of us all; but if no part of the church be in heaven, or
				       none but Enoch and Elias, it is not likely that the church would be
				       called the Jerusalem which is in heaven.
				</p><p>
				    2. The souls of true saints, when they leave their bodies at death, go
				       to be with Christ, as they go to dwell in the immediate, full and
				       constant sight or view of him.
				       When we are absent from our dear friends, they are out of sight;
				       but when we are with them, we have the opportunity and satisfaction
				       of seeing them. So while the saints are in the body, and are absent
				       from the Lord, HE is in several respects out of sight: 1 Pet. i. 8,
				       "Whom having not seen, ye love: in whom, though now ye see him not,
				       yet believing," etc. They have indeed, in this world, a spiritual
				       sight of Christ; but they see through a glass darkly, and with
				       great interruption; but in heaven they see him face to face, 1 Cor.
				       xiii. 12; "The pure in heart are blessed; for they shall see God,"
				       Matt. v. 8. Their beatifical vision of God is in Christ, who is
				       that brightness or effulgence of God's glory, by which his glory
				       shines forth in heaven, to the view of saints and angels there, as
				       well as here on earth. This is the Sun of righteousness, that is
				       not only the light of this world, but is also the sun that
				       enlightens the heavenly Jerusalem; by whose bright beams it is that
				       the glory of God shines forth there, to the enlightening and making
				       happy all the glorious inhabitants. "The Lamb is the light thereof;
				       and so the glory of God doth lighten it," Rev. xxi. 23. None sees
				       God the Father immediately, who is the King eternal, immortal,
				       invisible; Christ is the image of that invisible God, by which he
				       is seen by all elect creatures. The only begotten Son that is in
				       the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him, and manifested him.
				       None has ever immediately seen the Father, but the Son; and none
				       else sees the Father any other way, than by the Son's revealing
				       him. And in heaven, the spirits of just men made perfect do see him
				       as he is. They behold his glory. They see the glory of his divine
				       nature, consisting in all the glory of the Godhead, the beauty of
				       all his perfections; his great majesty, almighty power, his
				       infinite wisdom, holiness, and grace, and they see the beauty of
				       his glorified human nature, and the glory which the Father hath
				       given him, as God-man and Mediator. For this end, Christ desired
				       that his saints might "be with him, that they might behold his
				       glory," John xvii. 24. And when the souls of the saints leave their
				       bodies, to go to be with Christ, they behold the marvellous glory
				       of that great work of his, the work of redemption, and of the
				       glorious way of salvation by him; desire to look into. They have a
				       most clear view of the unfathomable depths of the manifold wisdom
				       and knowledge of God; and the most bright displays of the infinite
				       purity and holiness of God, that do appear in that way and work;
				       and see in a much clearer manner than the saints do here, what is
				       the breadth and length, and depth and height of the grace and love
				       of Christ, appearing in his redemption. And as they see the
				       unspeakable riches and glory of the attribute of God's grace, so
				       they most clearly behold and understand Christ's eternal and
				       unmeasurable dying love to them in particular. And in short, they
				       see every thing in Christ that tends to kindle and inflame love,
				       and every thing that tends to gratify love, and every thing that
				       tends to satisfy them: and that in the most clear and glorious
				       manner, without any darkness or delusion, without any impediment or
				       interruption. Now the saints, while in the body, see something of
				       Christ's glory and love; as we, in the dawning of the morning, see
				       something of the reflected light of the sun mingled with darkness;
				       but when separated from the body, they see their glorious and
				       loving Redeemer, as we see the sun when risen, and showing his
				       whole disk above the horizon, by his direct beams, in a clear
				       hemisphere, and with perfect day.
				</p><p>
				    3. The souls of true saints, when absent from the body go to be with
				       Jesus Christ, as they are brought into a most perfect conformity to
				       and union with him. Their spiritual conformity is begun while they
				       are in the hotly; here beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the
				       Lord, they are changed into the same image; but when they come to
				       see him as he is, in heaven, then they become like him in another
				       manner. That perfect sight will abolish all remains of deformity,
				       disagreement, and sinful unlikeness; as all darkness is abolished
				       before the full blaze of the sun's meridian light: it is impossible
				       that the least degree of obscurity should remain before such light;
				       so it is impossible the least degree of sin and spiritual deformity
				       should remain, in such a view of the spiritual beauty and glory of
				       Christ, as the saints enjoy in heaven; when they see that Sun of
				       righteousness without a cloud, they themselves shine forth as the
				       sun, and shall be as little suns, without a spot. For then is come
				       the time when Christ presents his saints to himself, in glorious
				       beauty; "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;" and
				       having holiness without a blemish. And then the saints' union with
				       Christ is perfected. This also is begun in this world. The relative
				       union is both begun and perfected at once, when the soul first
				       closes with Christ by faith: the real union, consisting in the
				       union of hearts and affections, and in the vital union, is begun in
				       this world and perfected in the next. The union of the heart of a
				       believer to Christ, is begun when his heart is drawn to Christ, by
				       the first discovery of divine excellency, at conversion; and
				       consequent on this drawing and closing of his heart with Christ, is
				       established a vital union with Christ; whereby the believer becomes
				       a living branch of the true vine, living by a communication of the
				       sap and vital juice of the stock and root; and a member of Christ's
				       mystical body, living by a communication of spiritual and vital
				       influences from the head, and by a kind of participation of
				       Christ's own life. But while the saints are in the body, there is
				       much remaining distance between Christ and them: there are
				       remainders of alienation, and the vital union is very imperfect;
				       and so consequently is the communication of spiritual life and
				       vital influences: there is much between Christ and believers to
				       keep them asunder, much indwelling sin, much temptation, a world of
				       carnal objects, to keep off the soul from Christ, and hinder a
				       perfect coalescence.
				       But when the soul leaves the body, all these clogs and hinderances
				       shall be removed, every separating wall shall be broken down, and
				       every impediment taken out of the way, and all distance shall
				       cease; the heart shall be wholly and forever attached and bound to
				       him, by a perfect view of his glory. And the vital union shall then
				       be brought to perfection; the soul shall live perfectly in and upon
				       Christ, being perfectly filled with his spirit, and animated by his
				       vital influences; living, as it were, only by Christ's life,
				       without any remainder of spiritual death, or carnal life.
				</p><p>
				    4. Departed souls of saints are with Christ, as they enjoy a glorious
				       and immediate intercourse and converse with him.
				       While we are present with our friends, we have opportunity for that
				       free and immediate conversation with them, which we cannot have in
				       absence from them. And therefore, by reason of the vastly more
				       free, perfect, and immediate intercourse with Christ, which the
				       saints enjoy when absent from the body, they are fitly represented
				       as present with him.
				       The most intimate intercourse becomes that relation that the saints
				       stand in to Jesus Christ; and especially becomes that most perfect
				       and glorious union they shall be brought into with him in heaven.
				       They are not merely Christ's servants, but his friends, John xv.
				       15. His brethren and companions, Psalm cxxii. 8; "yea, they are the
				       spouse of Christ." They are espoused or betrothed to Christ while
				       in the body; but when they go to heaven, they enter into the king's
				       palace, their marriage with him is come, and the king brings them
				       into his chambers indeed. They then go to dwell with Christ
				       constantly, to enjoy the most perfect converse with him. Christ
				       conversed in the most friendly manner with his disciples on earth;
				       he admitted one of them to lean on his bosom: but they are admitted
				       much more fully and freely to converse with him in heaven. Though
				       Christ be there in a state of glorious exaltation, reigning in the
				       majesty and glory of the sovereign Lord and God of heaven and
				       earth, angels and men; yet this will not hinder intimacy and
				       freedom of intercourse, but rather promote it. For he is thus
				       exalted, not only for himself, but for them; he is instated in this
				       glory of head over all things for their sakes, that they might be
				       exalted and glorified; and when they go to heaven where he is, they
				       are exalted and glorified with him; and shall not be kept at a more
				       awful distance from Christ, but shall be admitted nearer, and to a
				       greater intimacy. For they shall be unspeakably more fit for it,
				       and Christ in more fit circumstances to bestow on them this
				       blessedness. Their seeing the great glory of their friend and
				       Redeemer, will not awe them to a distance, and make them afraid of
				       a near approach; but on the contrary, will most powerfully draw
				       them near, and encourage and engage them to holy freedom. For they
				       will know that it is he that is their own Redeemer, and beloved
				       friend and bridegroom; the very same that loved them with a dying
				       love, and redeemed them to God by his blood; Matt. xiv. 27, "It is
				       I; be not afraid." Rev. i. 17, 18," Fear not:-I am he that liveth,
				       and was dead." And the nature of this glory of Christ that they
				       shall see, will be such as will draw and encourage them; for they
				       will not only see infinite majesty and greatness, but infinite
				       grace, condescension, and mildness, and gentleness and sweetness,
				       equal to his majesty. For he appears in heaven, not only as "the
				       Lion of the tribe of Judah, but as the Lamb, and the Lamb in the
				       midst of the throne, "Rev. v. 5, 6; and this Lamb in the midst of
				       the throne shall be their shepherd, to" feed them, and lead them to
				       living fountains of water," Rev. vii. 17; so that the sight of
				       Christ's great kingly majesty will be no terror to them; but will
				       only serve the more to heighten their pleasure and surprise. When
				       Mary was about to embrace Christ, being full of joy at the sight of
				       him again alive after his crucifixion, Christ forbids her to do it
				       for the ended: John xx. 16, 17, "Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She
				       turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni, which is to say,
				       Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet
				       ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I
				       ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God and your
				       God." As if he had said, "This is not the time and place for that
				       freedom your love to me desires: this is appointed in heaven after
				       my ascension. I am going thither; and you that are my true
				       disciples, shall, as my brethren and companions, soon be there with
				       me in my glory. And then there shall be no restraint. That is the
				       place appointed for the most perfect expressions of complacence and
				       endearment, and full enjoyment of mutual love." And accordingly the
				       souls of departed saints with Christ in heaven, shall have Christ
				       as it were unbosomed unto them, manifesting those infinite riches
				       of love towards them, that have been there from eternity; and they
				       shall be enabled to express their love to him, in an infinitely
				       better manner than ever they could while in the body. Thus they
				       shall eat and drink abundantly, and swim in the ocean of love, and
				       be eternally swallowed up in the infinitely bright, and infinitely
				       mild and sweet beams of divine love; eternally receiving that
				       light, eternally full of it, and eternally compassed round with it,
				       and everlastingly reflecting it back again to the fountain of it.
				</p><p>
				    5. The souls of the saints, when they leave their bodies at death, go
				       to be with Christ, as they are received to a glorious fellowship
				       with Christ in his blessedness.
				       As the wife is received to a joint possession of her husband's
				       estate, and as the wife of a prince partakes with him in his
				       princely possessions and honors; so the church, the spouse of
				       Christ, when the marriage comes, and she is received to dwell with
				       him in heaven, shall partake with him in his glory. When Christ
				       rose from the dead, and took possession of eternal life; this was
				       not as a private person, but as the public head of all his redeemed
				       people. He took possession of it for them, as well as for himself;
				       and "they are quickened together with him, and raised up together."
				       And so when he ascended into heaven, and was exalted to great glory
				       there, this also was as a public person. He took possession of
				       heaven, not only for himself, but his people, as their forerunner
				       and head, that they might ascend also, "and sit together in
				       heavenly places with him," Eph. ii. 5, 6. "Christ writes upon them
				       his new name," Rev. iii. 12; i.e., he makes them partakers of his
				       own glory and exaltation in heaven. His new name is that new honor
				       and glory that the Father invested him with, when he set him on his
				       own right hand. As a prince, when he advances any one to new
				       dignity in his kingdom, gives him a new title. Christ and his
				       saints shall be glorified together, Rom. viii. 17.
				       The saints in heaven have communion, or a joint participation with
				       Christ in his glory and blessedness in heaven, in the following
				       respects more especially.
				</p><p>
				    1. They partake with him in the ineffable delights he has in heaven,
				       in the enjoyment of his Father.
				       When Christ ascended into heaven, he was received to a glorious and
				       peculiar joy and blessedness in the enjoyment of his Father, who,
				       in his passion, hid his face from him; such an enjoyment as became
				       the relation he stood in to the Father, and such as was a meet
				       reward for the great and hard service he had performed on earth.
				       Then "God showed him the path of life, and brought him into his
				       presence, where is fulness of joy, and to sit on his right hand,
				       where there are pleasures for evermore," as is said of Christ,
				       Psalm xvi. 11. Then the Father "made him most blessed forever. He
				       made him exceeding glad with his countenance;" as in Psalm xxi. 6.
				       The saints, by virtue of their union with Christ, and being his
				       members, do, in some sort partake of his childlike relation to the
				       Father; and so are heirs with him of his happiness in the enjoyment
				       of his Father; as seems to be intimated by the apostle, in Gal. iv.
				       4-7. The spouse of Christ, by virtue of her espousals to that only
				       begotten Son of God, is, as it were, a partaker of his filial
				       relation to God, and becomes the king's daughter, Psalm xiv. 13,
				       and so partakes with her divine husband in his enjoyment of his
				       Father and her Father, his God and her God." A promise of this
				       seems to be implied in those words of Christ to Mary, John xx. 17.
				       Thus Christ's faithful servants "enter into the joy of their Lord,"
				       Matt. xxv. 21, 23, and "Christ's joy remains in them;" agreeably to
				       those words of Christ, John xv. 11. Christ from eternity is, as it
				       were, in the bosom of the Father, as the object of his infinite
				       complacence. In him is the Father's eternal happiness. Before the
				       world was, he was with the Father, in the enjoyment of his infinite
				       love; and had infinite delight and blessedness in that enjoyment;
				       as he declares of himself in Prov. viii. 30: "Then I was by him as
				       one brought up with him. And I was daily his delight, rejoicing
				       always before him." And when Christ ascended to the Father after
				       his passion, he went to him, to the enjoyment of the same glory and
				       blessedness in the enjoyment of his love; agreeably to his prayer
				       the evening before his crucifixion, John xvii. 5: "And now, O
				       Father, glorify me with thine own self, with the glory I had with
				       thee before the world was." And in the same prayer, he manifests it
				       to be his will, that his true disciples should be with him in the
				       enjoyment of that joy and glory, which he then asked for himself,
				       verse 13: "That my joy might be fulfilled in themselves:" verse 22,
				       "And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them." This glory
				       of Christ, which the saints are to enjoy with him, is that which he
				       has in the enjoyment of the Father's infinite love to him; as
				       appears by the last words of that prayer of our Lord, verse 26:
				       "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I
				       in them." The love which the Father has to his Son is great indeed:
				       the Deity does, as it were, wholly and entirely flow out in a
				       stream of love to Christ; and the joy and pleasure of Christ is
				       proportionably great. This is the stream of Christ's delights, the
				       river of his infinite pleasure; which he will make his saints to
				       drink of with him, agreeably to Psal. xxxvi. 8, 9: "They shall be
				       abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house. Thou shalt make
				       them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the
				       fountain of life. In thy light shall we see light." The saints
				       shall have pleasure in partaking with Christ in his pleasure, and
				       shall see light in his light. They shall partake with Christ of the
				       same river of pleasure, shall drink of the same water of life, and
				       of the same new wine in Christ's Father's kingdom, Matt. xxvi. 29.
				       That new wine is especially that joy and happiness that Christ and
				       his true disciples shall partake of together in glory, which is the
				       purchase of Christ's blood, or the reward of his obedience unto
				       death. Christ, at his ascension into heaven, received everlasting
				       pleasures at his Father's right hand, and in the enjoyment of his
				       Father's love, as the reward of his own death, or obedience unto
				       death. But the same righteousness is reckoned to both head and
				       members; and both shall have fellowship in the same reward, each
				       according to their distinct capacity.
				       That the saints in heaven have such a communion with Christ in his
				       joy, and do so partake with him in his own enjoyment of the Father,
				       does greatly manifest the transcendent excellency of their
				       happiness, and their being admitted to a vastly higher privilege in
				       glory than the angels.
				</p><p>
				    2. The saints in heaven are received to a fellowship or participation
				       with Christ in the glory of that dominion to which the Father hath
				       exalted him.
				</p><p>
				       The saints, when they ascend to heaven as Christ ascended, and are
				       made to sit together with him in heavenly places, and are partakers
				       of the glory of his exaltation, are exalted to reign with him. They
				       are through him made kings and priests, and reign with him, and in
				       him, over the same kingdom. As the Father hath appointed unto him a
				       kingdom, so he has appointed to them. The Father has appointed the
				       Son to reign over his own kingdom, and the Son appoints his saints
				       to reign in his. The Father has given to Christ to sit with him on
				       his throne, and Christ gives to the saints to sit with him on his
				       throne, agreeably to Christ's promise, Rev. iii. 21. Christ, as
				       God's Son, is the heir of his kingdom, and the saints are joint
				       heirs with Christ: which implies, that they are heirs of the same
				       inheritance, to possess the same kingdom, in and with him,
				       according to their capacity. Christ, in his kingdom, reigns over
				       heaven and earth; he is appointed the heir of all things; and so
				       all things are the saints'; "whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas,
				       or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to
				       come," all are theirs; because they are Christ's, and united to
				       him, 1 Cor. iii. 21, 22, 23. The angels are given to Christ as a
				       part of his dominion: they are all given to wait upon him as
				       ministering spirits to him. So also they are all, even the highest
				       and most dignified of them, ministering spirits, to minister to
				       them who are the heirs of salvation. They are Christ's angels, and
				       they are also their angels. Such is the saints' union with Christ,
				       and their interest in him, that what he possesses, they possess, in
				       a much more perfect and blessed manner than if all things were
				       given to them separately, and by themselves, to be disposed of
				       according to their discretion. They are now disposed of so as, in
				       every respect, to be most for their blessedness, by an infinitely
				       better discretion than their own; and in being disposed of by their
				       head and husband, between whom and them there is the most perfect
				       union of hearts, and so the most perfect union of wills, and who
				       are most perfectly each other's.
				</p><p>
				       As the glorified spouse of this great King reigns with and in him,
				       in his dominion over the universe, so more especially does she
				       partake with him in the joy and glory of his reign in his kingdom
				       of grace; which is more peculiarly the kingdom that he possesses as
				       Head of the church, and is that kingdom wherein she is more
				       especially interested. It was especially to reign in this kingdom,
				       that God the Father exalted him to his throne in heaven: he set his
				       King on his holy hill of Zion, especially that he might reign over
				       Zion, or over his church, in his kingdom of grace; and that he
				       might be under the best advantages to carry on the designs of his
				       love in this lower world. And therefore undoubtedly the saints in
				       heaven are partakers with Christ in the joy and glory of the
				       advancement and prosperity of his kingdom of grace on earth, and
				       success of his gospel here, which he looks on as the peculiar glory
				       of his reign.
				</p><p>
				       The good shepherd rejoices when he finds but one sheep that was
				       lost; and his friends and neighbors in heaven rejoice with him on
				       that occasion. That part of the family that is in heaven is surely
				       not unacquainted with the affairs of that part of the same family
				       that is on earth. They that are with the King and are next to him,
				       the royal family, that dwell in his palace, are not kept in
				       ignorance of the affairs of his kingdom. The saints in heaven are
				       with the angels, the King's ministers, by which he manages the
				       affairs of his kingdom, and who are continually ascending and
				       descending from heaven to the earth, and one or other of them daily
				       employed as ministering spirits to each individual member of the
				       church below: besides the continual ascending of the souls of
				       departed saints from all parts of the militant church. On these
				       accounts the saints in heaven must needs be under a thousand times
				       greater advantage than we here for a full view of the state of the
				       church on earth, and a speedy, direct, and certain acquaintance
				       with all its affairs in every part. And that which gives them much
				       greater advantage for such an acquaintance than the things already
				       mentioned, is their being constantly in the immediate presence of
				       Christ, and in the enjoyment of the most perfect intercourse with
				       him, who is the King who manages all these affairs, and has an
				       absolutely perfect knowledge of them. Christ is the head of the
				       whole glorified assembly; they are mystically his glorified body:
				       and what the head sees, it sees for the information of the whole
				       body, according to its capacity: and what the head enjoys, is for
				       the joy of the whole body.
				</p><p>
				       The saints, in leaving this world, and ascending to heaven, do not
				       go out of sight of things appertaining to Christ's kingdom on
				       earth; but, on the contrary, they go out of a state of obscurity,
				       and ascend above the mists and clouds into the clearest light: to a
				       pinnacle in the very centre of light, where every thing appears in
				       clear view. They have as much greater advantage to view the state
				       of Christ's kingdom, and the works of the new creation here, than
				       while they were in this world, as a man that ascends to the top of
				       a high mountain has a greater advantage to view the face of the
				       earth, than he had while he was in a deep valley, or thick forest
				       below, surrounded on every side with those things that impeded and
				       limited his sight. Nor do they view as indifferent or unconcerned
				       spectators, any more than Christ himself is an unconcerned
				       spectator.
				</p><p>
				       The happiness of the saints in heaven consists very much in
				       beholding the glory of God appearing in the work of redemption: for
				       it is by this chiefly that God manifests his glory, the glory of
				       his wisdom, holiness, grace, and other perfections, to both saints
				       and angels; as is apparent by many Scriptures. And therefore
				       undoubtedly their happiness consists very much in beholding the
				       progress of this work in its application and success, and the steps
				       by which infinite power and wisdom bring it to its consummation.
				       And the saints in heaven are under unspeakably greater advantage to
				       take the pleasure of beholding the progress of this work on earth
				       than we are that are here; as they are under greater advantages to
				       see and understand the marvellous steps that Divine Wisdom takes in
				       all that is done, and the glorious ends he obtains, the opposition
				       Satan makes, and how he is baffled and overthrown. They can better
				       see the connection of one event with another, and the beautiful
				       order of all things that come to pass in the church in different
				       ages that to us appear like confusion. Nor do they only view these
				       things, and rejoice in them, as a glorious and beautiful sight, but
				       as persons interested, as Christ is interested; as possessing these
				       things in Christ, and reigning with him, in this kingdom. Christ's
				       success in his work of redemption, in bringing home souls to
				       himself, applying his saving benefits by his Spirit, and the
				       advancement of the kingdom of grace in the world, is the reward
				       especially promised to him by his Father in the covenant of
				       redemption, for the hard and difficult service he performed while
				       in the form of a servant; as is manifest by Isai. liii. 10, 11, 12.
				       But the saints shall be rewarded with him: they shall partake with
				       him in the joy of this reward; for this obedience that is thus
				       rewarded is reckoned to them as they are his members, as was before
				       observed. This was especially the joy that was set before Christ,
				       for the sake of which he endured the cross and despised the shame.
				       And his joy is the joy of all heaven. They that are with him in
				       heaven are under much the greatest advantages to partake with him
				       in this joy; for they have a perfect communion with him through
				       whom, and in fellowship with whom, they enjoy and possess their
				       whole inheritance, all their heavenly happiness; as much as the
				       whole body has all its pleasure of music by the ear, and all the
				       pleasure of its food by the mouth and stomach; and all the benefit
				       and refreshment of the air by the lungs. The saints while on earth
				       pray and labor for the same thing that Christ labored for, viz.,
				       the advancement of the kingdom of God among men, the promoting of
				       the prosperity of Zion, and flourishing of religion in this world;
				       and most of them have suffered for that end as Christ did, have
				       been made partakers with their head in his sufferings, and "filled
				       up (as the apostle expresses it) that which is behind of the
				       sufferings of Christ:" and therefore they shall partake with him of
				       the glory and joy of the end obtained. Rom. viii. 17, "We are joint
				       heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
				       also glorified together." 2 Tim. ii. 12, "If we suffer with him, we
				       shall also reign with him." Christ, when his sufferings were past,
				       and he left the earth and ascended into heaven, was so far from
				       having done with kingdom in this world, that it was as it were but
				       then begun: and he ascended for that very end, that he might more
				       fully possess and enjoy this kingdom, that he might reign in it,
				       and be under the best advantages for it; as much as a king ascends
				       a throne in order to reign over his people, and receive the honor
				       and glory of his dominion. No more have the saints done with
				       Christ's kingdom on earth, when they leave the earth and ascend
				       into heaven. "Christ came (i.e., ascended) with clouds of heaven,
				       and came to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before him,
				       to the very end, that he might receive dominion, and glory, and a
				       kingdom, that all people, nations and languages, should serve him,"
				       Dan. vii. 13, 14. Which shall be eminently fulfilled after the ruin
				       of Antichrist, which is especially the time of Christ's kingdom.
				       And the same is the time when "the kingdom and dominion, and
				       greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to
				       the people of the saints of the Most High God;" as verse 27, in the
				       same chapter. It is because they shall reign in and with Christ,
				       the Most High, as seems intimated in the words that follow; "whose
				       kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve
				       and obey him." This verse is true, not only of the saints on earth,
				       but also the saints in heaven. Hence the saints in heaven, having
				       respect to this time, do sing, in Rev. v. 10, "We shall reign on
				       the earth." And agreeably hereto, it is afterwards represented,
				       that when the forementioned time comes, the souls of them that in
				       former ages had suffered with Christ do reign with Christ; having
				       as it were given to them new life and joy, in that spiritual
				       blessed resurrection, which shall then be of the church of God on
				       earth; and thus it is that it is said, Matt. v. 5, "The meek (those
				       that meekly and patiently suffer with Christ, and for his sake)
				       shall inherit the earth:" they shall inherit it, and reign on earth
				       with Christ. Christ is the heir of the world; and when the
				       appointed time of his kingdom comes, his inheritance shall be given
				       him, and then the meek, who are joint heirs, shall inherit the
				       earth. The place in the Old Testament whence the words are taken,
				       leads to a true interpretation of them. Psal. xxxvii. 11, "The meek
				       shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the
				       abundance of peace." That there is reference in these latter words,
				       "the abundance of peace," to the peace and blessedness of the
				       latter days, we may be satisfied by comparing these words with
				       Psal. lxxii. 7," In his days shall be abundance of peace so long as
				       the moon endureth:" and Jer. xxxiii. 6, "I will reveal to them the
				       abundance of peace and truth:" also Isai. ii. 4, Micah iv. 3, Isai.
				       xi. 6-9, and many other parallel places. The saints in heaven will
				       be as much with Christ in reigning over the nations, and in the
				       glory of his dominion at that time, as they will he with him in the
				       honor of judging the world at the last day. That promise of Christ
				       to his disciples, Matt. xix. 28, 29, seems to have a special
				       respect to the former of these. In verse 28, Christ promises to the
				       disciples, that hereafter, "when the Son of Man shall sit on the
				       throne of his glory, they shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the
				       twelve tribes of Israel." The saints in heaven reigning on earth in
				       the glorious latter day, is described in language accommodated to
				       this promise of Christ, Rev. xx. 4: "And I saw thrones, and they
				       sat upon them; and judgment was given them. And they reigned with
				       Christ." And the promise in the next verse, in that xixth of
				       Matthew, seems to have its fulfillment at the same time: "And every
				       one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or fathers,
				       or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake shall receive a
				       hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life;" i.e., in the
				       time when the saints shall inherit the earth and reign on earth,
				       the earth, with all its blessings and good things, shall be given
				       in great abundance to the church, to be possessed by the saints.
				       This shall they receive in this present world, and in the time to
				       come everlasting life. The saints in heaven shall partake with
				       Christ in the triumph and glory of those victories that he shall
				       obtain in that future glorious time, over the kings and nations of
				       the world, that are sometimes represented by his ruling them with a
				       rod of iron, and dashing them in pieces as a potter's vessel. Which
				       doubtless there is respect to in Rev. ii. 26, 27: "He that
				       overcometh, and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give
				       power over the nations: (and he shall rule them with a rod of iron;
				       as the vessel of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:) even as
				       I received of my Father." And Psal. cxlix. 5, to the end: "Let the
				       saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds;"
				       i.e., in their separate state after death; compare Isai. lvii. 1,
				       2. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
				       sword in their hand: to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and
				       punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and
				       their nobles with fetters of iron, to execute upon them the
				       judgment written: this honor have all the saints." Accordingly when
				       Christ appears riding forth to his victory over Antichrist, Rev.
				       xix., the hosts of heaven appear going forth with him in robes of
				       triumph, verse 14. And when Antichrist is destroyed, the
				       inhabitants of heaven, and the holy apostles and prophets, are
				       called upon to rejoice, chap. xviii. 20. And accordingly the whole
				       multitude of the inhabitants of heaven, on that occasion, do appear
				       to exult and praise God with exceeding joy, chap. xix. 1?8, and
				       chap. xi. 15; and are also represented as greatly rejoicing on
				       occasion of the ruin of the heathen empire, in the days of
				       Constantine, chap xii. 10.
				</p><p>
				       And it is observable all along in the visions of that book, the
				       hosts of heaven appear as much concerned and interested in the
				       events appertaining to the kingdom of Christ here below, as the
				       saints on earth. The day of the commencement of the church's latter
				       day glory is eminently "the day of Christ's espousals; the day of
				       the gladness of his heart, when as the bridegroom rejoiceth over
				       the bride, so he will rejoice over his church." And then will all
				       heaven exceedingly rejoice with him. And therefore they say at that
				       time, Rev. xix. 7, "Let us be glad, and rejoice, and give glory to
				       him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come."
				       Thus Abraham enjoys these things when they come to pass, that were
				       of old promised to him, and that he saw beforehand, and rejoiced
				       in. He will enjoy the fulfilment of the promise of all the families
				       of the earth being blessed in his seed, when it shall be
				       accomplished. And all the ancient patriarchs, who died in faith of
				       promises of glorious things that should be accomplished in this
				       world, "who had not received the promises, but saw them afar off,
				       and were persuaded of them, and embraced them," do actually enjoy
				       them when fulfilled. David actually saw and enjoyed the fulfilment
				       of that promise, in its due time, which was made to him many
				       hundred years before, and was all his salvation and all his desire.
				       Thus Daniel shall stand in his lot at the end of the days pointed
				       out by his own prophecy. Thus the saints of old that died in faith,
				       not having received the promises, are made perfect, and have their
				       faith crowned by the better things accomplished in these latter
				       days of the gospel, Heb. xi. 39, 40, which they see and enjoy in
				       their time.
				</p><p>
				    3. The departed souls of saints have fellowship with Christ, in his
				       blessed and eternal employment of glorifying the Father.
				       The happiness of heaven consists not only in contemplation, and a
				       mere passive enjoyment, but consists very much in action. And
				       particularly in actively serving and glorifying God. This is
				       expressly mentioned as a great part of the blessedness of the
				       saints in their most perfect state, Rev. xxii. 3: "And there shall
				       be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in
				       it; and his servants shall serve him." The angels are as a flame of
				       fire in their ardor and activity in God's service: the four
				       animals, Rev. iv. (which are generally supposed to signify the
				       angels), are represented as continually giving praise and glory to
				       God, and are said not to rest day nor night, verse 8. The souls of
				       departed saints are, doubtless, become as the angels of God in
				       heaven in this respect. And Jesus Christ is the head of the whole
				       glorious assembly; as in other things appertaining to their blessed
				       state, so in this of their praising and glorifying the Father. When
				       Christ, the night before he was crucified, prayed for his
				       exaltation to glory, it was that he might glorify the Father: John
				       xvii. 1, "These words spake Jesus, and lift up his eyes to heaven,
				       and said, Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son
				       also may glorify thee." And this he doubtless does, now he is in
				       heaven; not only in fulfilling the Father's will, in what he does
				       as head of the church and ruler of the universe, but also in
				       leading the heavenly assembly in their praises. When Christ
				       instituted the Supper, and ate and drank with his disciples at his
				       table (giving them therein a representation and pledge of their
				       future feasting with him, and drinking new wine in his heavenly
				       Father's kingdom), he at that time led them in their praises to
				       God, in that hymn that they sang. And so doubtless he leads his
				       glorified disciples in heaven. David was the sweet psalmist of
				       Israel, and he led the great congregation of God's people in their
				       songs of praise. Herein, as well as in innumerable other things, he
				       was a type of Christ, who is often spoken of in Scripture by the
				       name of David. And many of the psalms that David penned, were songs
				       of praise, that he, by the spirit of prophecy, uttered in the name
				       of Christ, as Head of the church, and leading the saints in their
				       praises. Christ in heaven leads the glorious assembly in their
				       praises to God, as Moses did the congregation of Israel at the Red
				       Sea; which is implied in its being said, that "they sing the song
				       of Moses and the Lamb," Rev. xv. 2, 3. In Rev. xix. 5, John tells
				       us, that "he heard a voice come out of the throne, saying, Praise
				       our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and
				       great." Who can it be that utters this voice out of the throne, but
				       the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne, calling on the
				       glorious assembly of saints to praise his Father and their Father,
				       his God and their God? And what the consequence of this voice is,
				       we have an account in the next words: "And I heard as it were the
				       voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as
				       the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia; for the Lord God
				       omnipotent reigneth."
				</p><p>
				  <hi type="bold">APPLICATION</hi>
				</p><p>
				   The use that I would make of what has been said on this subject is of
				   exhortation. Let us all be exhorted hence earnestly to seek after that
				   great privilege that has been spoken of, that when "we are absent from
				   the body, we may be present with the Lord." We cannot continue always
				   in these earthly tabernacles: they are very frail, and will soon decay
				   and fall; and are continually liable to be overthrown by innumerable
				   means: our souls must soon leave them, and go into the eternal world.
				   O, how infinitely great will the privilege and happiness of such be,
				   who at that time shall go to be with Christ in his glory, in the manner
				   that has been represented! The privilege of the twelve disciples was
				   great, in being so constantly with Christ as his family, in his state
				   of humiliation. The privilege of those three disciples was great, who
				   were with him in the mount of his transfiguration; where was exhibited
				   to them some little semblance of his future glory in heaven, such as
				   they might behold in the present frail, feeble, and sinful state: they
				   were greatly entertained and delighted with what they saw; and were for
				   making tabernacles to dwell there, and return no more down the mount.
				   And great was the privilege of Moses when he was with Christ in Mount
				   Sinai, and besought him to show him his glory, and he saw his back
				   parts as he passed by, and proclaimed his name. But is not that
				   privilege infinitely greater, that has now been spoken of, the
				   privilege of being with Christ in heaven, where he sits on the right
				   hand of God, in the glory of the King and God of angels, and of the
				   whole universe, shining forth as the great light, the bright sun of
				   that world of glory; there to dwell in the full, constant and
				   everlasting view of his beauty and brightness; there most freely and
				   intimately to converse with him, and fully to enjoy his love, as his
				   friends and spouse; there to have fellowship with him in the infinite
				   pleasure and joy he has in the enjoyment of his Father; there to sit
				   with him on his throne, and reign with him in the possession of all
				   things, and partake with him in the joy and glory of his victory over
				   his enemies, and the advancement of his kingdom in the world, and to
				   join with him in joyful songs of praise to his Father and their Father,
				   to his God and their God, forever and ever? Is not such a privilege
				   worth the seeking after?
				</p><p>
				   But here, as a special enforcement of this exhortation, I would improve
				   that dispensation of God's holy providence, that is the sorrowful
				   occasion of our coming together at this time, viz., the death of that
				   eminent servant of Jesus Christ, in the work of the gospel ministry,
				   whose funeral is this day to be attended; together with what was
				   observable in him, living and dying.
				</p><p>
				   In this dispensation of Providence, God puts us in mind of our
				   mortality, and forewarns us that the time is approaching when we must
				   be absent from the body, and "must all appear (as the apostle observes
				   in the next verse but one to my text) before the judgment seat of
				   Christ, that every one of us may receive the things done in the body,
				   according to what we have done, whether it be good or bad."
				</p><p>
				   And in him, whose death we are now called to consider and improve, we
				   have not only an instance of mortality, but an instance of one that,
				   being absent from the body, is present with the Lord; as we have all
				   imaginable reason to conclude. And that, whether we consider the nature
				   of the operations he was under, about the time whence he dates his
				   conversion, or the nature and course of his inward exercises from that
				   time forward, or his outward conversation and long space wherein he
				   looked death in the face.
				</p><p>
				   His convictions of sin, preceding his first consolations in Christ (as
				   appears by a written account he has left of his inward exercises and
				   experiences), were exceeding deep and thorough: his trouble and
				   exercise of mind, through a sense of guilt and misery, very great and
				   long continued, but yet sound and solid; consisting in no unsteady,
				   violent and unaccountable hurries and frights, and strange
				   perturbations of mind; but arising from the most serious consideration,
				   and proper illumination of the conscience to discern and consider the
				   true state of things. And the light let into his mind at conversion,
				   and the influences and exercises that his mind was subject to at that
				   time, appear very agreeable to reason and the gospel of Jesus Christ;
				   the change very great and remarkable, without any appearance of strong
				   impressions on the imagination, sudden flights and pangs of the
				   affections, and vehement emotions in animal nature; but attended with
				   proper intellectual views of the supreme glory of the divine Being,
				   consisting in the infinite dignity and beauty of the perfections of his
				   nature, and of the transcendent excellency of the way of salvation by
				   Christ. This was about eight years ago, when he was about twenty-one
				   years of age.
				</p><p>
				   Thus God sanctified and made meet for his use, that vessel that he
				   intended to make eminently a vessel of honor in his house, and which he
				   had made of large capacity, having endowed him with very uncommon
				   abilities and gifts of nature. He was a singular instance of a ready
				   invention, natural eloquence, easy flowing expression, sprightly
				   apprehension, quick discerning, and a very strong memory; and yet of a
				   very penetrating genius, close and clear thought, and piercing
				   judgment. He had an exact taste: his understanding was (if I may so
				   express it) of a quick, strong and distinguishing scent.
				</p><p>
				   His learning was very considerable: he had a great taste for learning;
				   and applied himself to his studies in so close a manner when he was at
				   college, that he much injured his health; and was obliged on that
				   account for a while to leave the college, throw by his studies and
				   return home. He was esteemed one that excelled in learning in that
				   society.
				</p><p>
				   He had an extraordinary knowledge of men, as well as things. Had a
				   great insight into human nature, and excelled most that ever I knew in
				   a communicative faculty: he had a peculiar talent at accommodating
				   himself to the capacities, tempers and circumstances, of those that he
				   would instruct or counsel.
				</p><p>
				   He had extraordinary gifts for the pulpit: I never had opportunity to
				   hear him preach, but have often heard him pray: and I think his manner
				   of addressing himself to God, and expressing himself before him, in
				   that duty, almost inimitable; such (so far as I may judge) as I have
				   very rarely known equalled. He expressed himself with that exact
				   propriety and pertinency, in such significant, weighty, pungent
				   expressions; with that decent appearance of sincerity, reverence, and
				   solemnity, and great distance from all affectation, as forgetting the
				   presence of men, and as being in the immediate presence of a great and
				   holy God, that I have scarcely ever known paralleled. And his manner of
				   preaching, by what I have often heard of it from good judges, was no
				   less excellent; being clear and instructive, natural, nervous,
				   forcible, and moving, and very searching and convincing. He nauseated
				   an affected noisiness, and violent boisterousness in the pulpit; and
				   yet much disrelished a flat, cold delivery, when the subject of
				   discourse, and matter delivered, required affection and earnestness.
				</p><p>
				   Not only had he excellent talents for the study and the pulpit, but
				   also for conversation. He was of a sociable disposition; and was
				   remarkably free, entertaining, and profitable in ordinary discourse;
				   and had much of a faculty of disputing, defending truth and confuting
				   error.
				</p><p>
				   As he excelled in his judgment and knowledge of things in general, so
				   especially in divinity. He was truly, for one of his standing, an
				   extraordinary divine. But above all, in matters relating to
				   experimental religion. In this, I know I have the concurring opinion of
				   some that have had a name for persons of the best judgment. And
				   according to what ability I have to judge things of this nature, and
				   according to my opportunities, which of late have been very great, I
				   never knew his equal, of his age and standing, for clear, accurate
				   notions of the nature and essence of true religion, and its
				   distinctions from its various false appearances; which I suppose to be
				   owing to these three things meeting together in him;-the strength of
				   his natural genius, and the great opportunities he had of observation
				   of others, in various parts, both white people and Indians, and his own
				   great experience.
				</p><p>
				   His experiences of the holy influences of God's Spirit were not only
				   great at his first conversion, but they were so, in a continued course,
				   from that time forward; as appears by a record, or private journal, he
				   kept of his daily inward exercises, from the time of his conversion,
				   until he was disabled by the failing of his strength, a few days before
				   his death. The change which he looked upon as his conversion, was not
				   only a great change of the present views, affections, and frame of his
				   mind; but was evidently the beginning of that work of God on his heart,
				   which God carried on, in a very wonderful manner, from that time to his
				   dying day. He greatly abhorred the way of such, as live on their first
				   work, as though they had now got through their work, and are thence
				   forward, by degrees, settled in a cold, lifeless, negligent, worldly
				   frame; he had an ill opinion of such persons' religion. [3]
				</p><p>
				   Oh that the things that were seen and heard in this extraordinary
				   person, his holiness, heavenliness, labor and self- denial in life, his
				   so remarkably devoting himself and his all, in heart and practice, to
				   the glory of God, and the wonderful frame of mind manifested, in so
				   steadfast a manner, under the expectation of death, and the pains and
				   agonies that brought it on, may excite in us all, both ministers and
				   people, a due sense of the greatness of the work we have to do in the
				   world, the excellency and amiableness of thorough religion in
				   experience and practice, and the blessedness of the end of such, whose
				   death finishes such a life, and the infinite value of their eternal
				   reward, when absent from the body and present with the Lord; and
				   effectually stir us up to endeavors, that in the way of such a holy
				   life we may at least come to so blessed an end. AMEN.

				<title>The Importance and Advantage of a Thorough Knowledge of Divine Truth</title>
				<p>
				  A Sermon
				    by
				  Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
			        (from Works (Worcester reprint), IV:1-15.)
				</p><p>
				    <reference osisRef="Heb.5.12">Hebrews 5:12</reference> : For when, for the time, ye ought to be teachers, ye have
				    need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles
				    of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
				</p><p>
				   These words are a complaint, which the apostle makes of a certain
				   defect in the Christian Hebrews, to whom he wrote. Wherein we may
				   observe,
				</p><p>
				   1. What the defect complained of is, viz., a want of such a proficiency
				   in the knowledge of the doctrines and mysteries of religion, as might
				   have been expected of them. The apostle complains of them, that they
				   had not made that progress in their acquaintance with the things of
				   divinity or things taught in the oracles of God, which they ought to
				   have made. And he means to reprove them, not merely for their
				   deficiency in spiritual and experimental knowledge of divine things,
				   but for their deficiency in a doctrinal acquaintance with the
				   principles of religion, and the truths of Christian divinity; as is
				   evident by several things.
				</p><p>
				   It appears by the manner in which the apostle introduces this complaint
				   or reproof. The occasion of his introducing it, is this: in the next
				   verse but one preceding he mentions Christ's being a high priest after
				   the order of Melchizedek: "Called of God a high priest after the order
				   of Melchizedek." This Melchizedek being in the Old Testament, which was
				   the oracles of God, held forth as an eminent type of Christ, and the
				   account we there have of Melchizedek containing many gospel mysteries,
				   these the apostle was willing to point out to the Christian Hebrews.
				   But he apprehended that through their weakness in knowledge, and little
				   acquaintance in mysteries of that nature, they would not understand
				   him; and therefore breaks off for the present from saying anything
				   about Melchizedek. Thus, in verse 11, "Of whom we have many things to
				   say, and hard to be uttered; seeing ye are dull of hearing;" i.e.,
				   there are many things concerning Melchizedek, which contain wonderful
				   gospel mysteries, and which I would take notice of to you, were it not
				   that I am afraid, that through your dullness and backwardness in
				   understanding these things, you would only be puzzled and confounded by
				   my discourse, and so receive no benefit; and that it would be too hard
				   for you, as meat that is too strong.
				</p><p>
				   Then come in the words of the text: "For when, for the time, ye ought
				   to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the
				   first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have
				   need of milk, and not of strong meat." As much as to say, Indeed it
				   might have been expected of you, that you should have known enough of
				   divinity, and the holy Scriptures, to be able to understand and digest
				   such mysteries: but it is not so with you.
				</p><p>
				   Again, The apostle speaks of their proficiency in such knowledge as is
				   conveyed and received by human teaching; as appears by that expression,
				   "When for the time ye ought to be teachers;" which includes not only a
				   practical and experimental, but also a doctrinal knowledge of the
				   truths and mysteries of religion.
				</p><p>
				   Again, The apostle speaks of such a knowledge, whereby Christians are
				   enabled to digest strong meat; i.e., to understand those things in
				   divinity which are more abstruse and difficult to be understood, and
				   which require great skill in things of this nature. This is more fully
				   expressed in the two next verses: for everyone that useth milk, is
				   unskillful in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe. But strong
				   meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who, by reason
				   of use, have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
				   Again, It is such a knowledge, that proficiency in it shall carry
				   persons beyond the first principles of religion. As here: "Ye have need
				   that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles
				   of God." Therefore the apostle, in the beginning of the next chapter,
				   advises them, "to leave the first principles of the doctrine of Christ,
				   and go on unto perfection."
				</p><p>
				   2. We may observe wherein the fault of this defect appears, viz., in
				   that they had not made proficiency according to their time. For the
				   time, they ought to have been teachers. As they were Christians, their
				   business was to learn and gain Christian knowledge. They were scholars
				   in the school of Christ; and if they had improved their time in
				   learning, as they ought to have done, they might, by the time when the
				   apostle wrote, have been fit to be teachers in this school. To whatever
				   business any one is devoted, it may be expected that his perfection in
				   it shall be answerable to the time he has had to learn and perfect
				   himself- Christians should not always remain babes, but should grow in
				   Christian knowledge; and, leaving the food of babes, which is milk,
				   should learn to digest strong meat.
				</p><p>
				   DOCTRINE: Every Christian should make a business of endeavoring to grow
				   in knowledge in divinity.
				</p><p>
				   This is indeed esteemed the business of divines and ministers: it is
				   commonly thought to be their work, by the study of the Scriptures, and
				   other instructive books, to gain knowledge; and most seem to think that
				   it may be left to them, as what belongeth not to others., But if the
				   apostle had entertained this notion, he would never have blamed the
				   Christian Hebrews for not having acquired knowledge enough to be
				   teachers: or if he had thought, that this concerned Christians in
				   general, only as a thing by the by, and that their time should not, in
				   a considerable measure, be taken up with this business; he never would
				   have so much blamed them, that their proficiency in knowledge had not
				   been answerable to the time which they had had to learn.
				</p><p>
				   In handling this subject, I shall show,
				</p><p>
				   1. What divinity is.
				</p><p>
				   2. What kind of knowledge in divinity is intended.
				</p><p>
				   3. Why knowledge in divinity is necessary.
				</p><p>
				   4. Why all Christians should make a business of endeavoring to grow in
				   this knowledge.
				</p><p>
				   First, I shall very briefly show what divinity is.
				</p><p>
				   Various definitions have been given of it by those who have treated on
				   the subject. I shall not now stand to inquire which, according to the
				   rules of art, is the most accurate definition; but shall so define or
				   describe it, as I think has the greatest tendency to convey a notion of
				   it to this auditory.
				</p><p>
				   By divinity is meant, that science or doctrine which comprehends all
				   those truths and rules which concern the great business of religion.
				   There are various kinds of arts and sciences taught and learned in the
				   schools, which are conversant about various objects; about the works of
				   nature in general; as philosophy; or the visible heavens, as astronomy;
				   or the sea, as navigation; or the earth, as geography; or the body of
				   man, as physic and anatomy; or the soul of man, with regard to its
				   natural powers and qualities, as logic and pneumatology; or about human
				   government, as politics and jurisprudence. But there is one science, or
				   one certain kind of knowledge and doctrine, which is above all the
				   rest, as it is concerning God and the great business of religion: this
				   is divinity; which is not learned, as other sciences, merely by the
				   improvement of man's natural reason, but is taught by God himself in a
				   certain book that he hath given for that end, full of instruction. This
				   is the rule which God hath given to the world to be their guide in
				   searching after this kind of knowledge, and is a summary of all things
				   of this nature needful for us to know. Upon this account divinity is
				   rather called a doctrine, than an art or science.
				</p><p>
				   Indeed there is what is called natural religion or divinity. There are
				   many truths concerning God, and our duty to him, which are evident by
				   the light of nature. But Christian divinity, properly so called, is not
				   evident by the light of nature; it depends on revelation. Such are our
				   circumstances now in our fallen state, that nothing which it is needful
				   for us to know concerning God, is manifest by the light of nature in
				   the manner in which it is necessary for us to know it. For the
				   knowledge of no truth in divinity is of any significance to us, any
				   otherwise than, as it some way or other belongs to the gospel scheme,
				   or as it relates to a Mediator. But the light of nature teaches us no
				   truth of divinity in this matter. Therefore it cannot be said, that we
				   come to the knowledge of any part of Christian divinity by the light of
				   nature. The light of nature teaches no truth as it is in Jesus. It is
				   only the word of God, contained in the Old and New Testament, which
				   teaches us Christian divinity.
				</p><p>
				   Divinity comprehends all that is taught in the Scriptures, and so all
				   that we need know, or is to be known, concerning God and Jesus Christ,
				   concerning our duty to God, and our happiness in God. Divinity is
				   commonly defined, the doctrine of living to God and by some who seem to
				   be more accurate, the doctrine of living to God by Christ. It
				   comprehends all Christian doctrines as they are in Jesus, and all
				   Christian rules directing us in living to God by Christ. There is
				   nothing in divinity, no one doctrine, no promise, no rule, but what
				   some way or other relates to the Christian and divine life, or our
				   living to God by Christ. They all relate to this, in two respects,
				   viz., as they tend to promote our living to God here in this world, in
				   a life of faith and holiness, and also as they tend to bring us to a
				   life of perfect holiness and happiness, in the full enjoyment of God
				   hereafter-But I hasten to the
				</p><p>
				   Second thing proposed, viz., To show what kind of knowledge in divinity
				   is intended in the doctrine.
				</p><p>
				   Here I would observe:
				</p><p>
				   1. That there are two kinds of knowledge of the things of divinity,
				   viz., speculative and practical, or in other terms, natural and
				   spiritual. The former remains only in the head. No other faculty but
				   the understanding is concerned in it. It consists in having a natural
				   or rational knowledge of the things of religion, or such a knowledge as
				   is to be obtained by the natural exercise of our own faculties, without
				   any special illumination of the Spirit of God. The latter rests not
				   entirely in the head, or in the speculative ideas of things; but the
				   heart is concerned in it: it principally consists in the sense of the
				   heart. The mere intellect, without the heart, the will or the
				   inclination, is not the seat of it. And it may not only be called
				   seeing, but feeling or tasting. Thus there is a difference between
				   having a right speculative notion of the doctrines contained in the
				   word of God, and having a due sense of them in the heart. In the former
				   consists speculative or natural knowledge of the things of divinity; in
				   the latter consists the spiritual or practical knowledge of them.
				</p><p>
				   2. Neither of these is intended in the doctrine exclusively of the
				   other: but it is intended that we should seek the former in order to
				   the latter. The latter, even a spiritual and practical knowledge of
				   divinity, is of the greatest importance; for a speculative knowledge of
				   it, without a spiritual knowledge, is in vain and to no purpose, but to
				   make our condemnation the greater. Yet a speculative knowledge is also
				   of infinite importance in this respect, that without it we can have no
				   spiritual or practical knowledge; as may be shown by and by.
				</p><p>
				   I have already shown, that the apostle speaks not only of a spiritual
				   knowledge, but of such knowledge as can be acquired, and communicated
				   from one to another. Yet it is not to be thought, that he means this
				   exclusively of the other,. But he would have the Christian Hebrews seek
				   the one, in order to the other. Therefore the former is first and most
				   directly intended; it is intended that Christians should, by reading
				   and other proper means, seek a good rational knowledge of the things of
				   divinity. The latter is more indirectly intended, since it is to be
				   sought by the other, as its end.
				</p><p>
				   But I proceed to the third thing proposed, viz., to show the usefulness
				   and necessity of knowledge in divinity.
				</p><p>
				   1. There is no other way by which any means of grace whatsoever can be
				   of any benefit, but by knowledge. All teaching is in vain, without
				   learning. Therefore, the preaching of the gospel would be wholly to no
				   purpose, if it conveyed no knowledge to the mind. There is an order of
				   men whom Christ has appointed on purpose to be teachers in his church.
				   They are to teach the things of divinity. But they teach in vain, if no
				   knowledge in these things is gained by their teaching. It is impossible
				   that their teaching and preaching should be a means of grace, or of any
				   good in the hearts of their hearers, any otherwise than by knowledge
				   imparted to the understanding. Otherwise it would be of as much benefit
				   to the auditory, if the minister should preach in some unknown tongue.
				   All the difference is, that preaching in a known tongue conveys
				   something to the understanding, which preaching in an unknown tongue
				   doth not. On this account, such preaching must be unprofitable. Men in
				   such things receive nothing, when they understand nothing; and are not
				   at all edified, unless some knowledge be conveyed; agreeably to the
				   apostle's arguing in <reference osisRef="1Cor.14.2 1Cor.14.3 1Cor.14.4 1Cor.14.5 1Cor.14.6">1 Corinthians 14:2-6</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   No speech can be any means of grace, but by conveying knowledge.
				   Otherwise the speech is as much lost as if there had been no man there,
				   and he that spoke, had spoken only into the air; as it follows in the
				   passage just quoted, verses 6-10. He that doth not understand, can
				   receive no faith, nor any other grace; for God deals with man as with a
				   rational creature; and when faith is in exercise, it is not about
				   something he knows not what. Therefore hearing is absolutely necessary
				   to faith; because hearing is necessary to understanding: <reference osisRef="Rom.10.14">Romans 10:14</reference>,
				   "How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" So there
				   can be no love without knowledge. It is not according to the nature of
				   the human soul, to love an object which is entirely unknown. The heart
				   cannot be set upon an object of which there is no idea in the
				   understanding. The reasons which induce the soul to love, must first be
				   understood, before they can have a reasonable influence on the heart.
				</p><p>
				   God hath given us the Bible, which is a book of instructions. But this
				   book can be of no manner of profit to us, any otherwise than as it
				   conveys some knowledge to the mind: it can profit us no more than if it
				   were written in the Chinese or Tartarian language, of which we know not
				   one word.
				</p><p>
				   So the sacraments of the gospel can have a proper effect no other way,
				   than by conveying some knowledge. They represent certain things by
				   visible signs. and what is the end of signs, but to convey some
				   knowledge of the things signified? Such is the nature of man, that
				   nothing can come at the heart, but through the door of the
				   understanding: and there can be no spiritual knowledge of that of which
				   there is not first a rational knowledge. It is impossible that any one
				   should see the truth or excellency of any doctrine of the gospel, who
				   knows not what that doctrine is. A man cannot see the wonderful
				   excellency and love of Christ in doing such and such things for
				   sinners, unless his understanding be first informed how those things
				   were done. He cannot have a taste of the sweetness and divine
				   excellency of such and such things contained in divinity, unless he
				   first have a notion that there are such and such things.
				</p><p>
				   2. Without knowledge in divinity, none would differ from the most
				   ignorant and barbarous heathens. The heathens remain in gross
				   heathenish darkness, because they are not instructed, and have not
				   obtained the knowledge of the truths of divinity. So if we live under
				   the preaching of the gospel, this will make us to differ from them,
				   only by conveying to us more knowledge of the things of divinity.
				</p><p>
				   3. If a man have no knowledge of these things, the faculty of reason in
				   him will be wholly in vain. The faculty of reason and understanding was
				   given for actual understanding and knowledge. If a man have no actual
				   knowledge, the faculty or capacity of knowing is of no use to him. And
				   if he have actual knowledge, yet if he be destitute of the knowledge of
				   those things which are the last end of his being, and for the sake of
				   the knowledge of which he had more understanding given him than the
				   beasts; then still his faculty of reason is in vain; he might as well
				   have been a beast, as a man with this knowledge. But the things of
				   divinity are the things to know which we had the faculty of reason
				   given us. They are the things which appertain to the end of our being,
				   and to the great business for which we are made. Therefore a man cannot
				   have his faculty of understanding to any purpose, any further than he
				   hath knowledge of the things of divinity.
				</p><p>
				   So that this kind of knowledge is absolutely necessary. Other kinds of
				   knowledge may be very useful. Some other sciences, such as astronomy,
				   and natural philosophy, and geography, may be very excellent in their
				   kind. But the knowledge of this divine science is infinitely more
				   useful and important than of all other sciences whatever.
				</p><p>
				   I come now to the fourth, and principal thing proposed under the
				   doctrine, viz., to give the reasons why all Christians should make a
				   business of endeavoring to grow in the knowledge of divinity. This
				   implies two things.
				</p><p>
				   1. That Christians ought not to content themselves with such degrees of
				   knowledge in divinity as they have already obtained. It should not
				   satisfy them that they know as much as is absolutely necessary to
				   salvation, but should seek to make progress.
				</p><p>
				   2. That this endeavoring to make progress in such knowledge ought not
				   to be attended to as a thing by the by, but all Christians should make
				   a business of it: they should look upon it as a part of their daily
				   business, and no small part of it neither. It should be attended to as
				   a considerable part of the work of their high calling. The reason of
				   both these may appear in the following things.
				</p><p>
				   (1.) Our business should doubtless much consist in employing those
				   faculties, by which we are distinguished from the beasts, about those
				   things which are the main end of those faculties. The reason why we
				   have faculties superior to those of the brutes given us, is, that we
				   are indeed designed for a superior employment. That which the Creator
				   intended should be our main employment, is something above what he
				   intended the beasts for, and therefore hath given us superior powers.
				   Therefore, without doubt, it should be a considerable part of our
				   business to improve those superior faculties. But the faculty by which
				   we are chiefly distinguished from the brutes, is the faculty of
				   understanding. It follows then, that we should make it our chief
				   business to improve this faculty, and should by no means prosecute it
				   as a business by the by. For us to make the improvement of this faculty
				   a business by the by, is in effect for us to make the faculty of
				   understanding itself a by faculty, if I may so speak, a faculty of less
				   importance than others; whereas indeed it is the highest faculty we
				   have.
				</p><p>
				   But we cannot make a business of the improvement of our intellectual
				   faculty, any otherwise than by making a business of improving ourselves
				   in actual understanding and knowledge. So that those who make not this
				   very much their business, but, instead of improving their understanding
				   to acquire knowledge, are chiefly devoted to their inferior powers, to
				   provide wherewithal to please their senses, and gratify their animal
				   appetites, and so rather make their understanding a servant to their
				   inferior powers, than their inferior powers servants to their
				   understanding; not only behave themselves in a manner not becoming
				   Christians, but also act as if they had forgotten that they are men,
				   and that God hath set them above the brutes, by giving them
				   understanding.
				</p><p>
				   God hath given to man some things in common with the brutes, as his
				   outward senses, his bodily appetites, a capacity of bodily pleasure and
				   pain, and other animal faculties: and some things he hath given him
				   superior to the brutes, the chief of which is a faculty of
				   understanding and reason. Now God never gave man those faculties
				   whereby he is above the brutes, to be subject to those which he hath in
				   common with the brutes. This would be great confusion, and equivalent
				   to making man to be a servant to the beasts. On the contrary, he has
				   given those inferior powers to be employed in subserviency to man's
				   understanding; and therefore it must be a great part of man's principal
				   business, to improve his understanding by acquiring knowledge. If so,
				   then it will follow, that it should be a main part of his business to
				   improve his understanding in acquiring divine knowledge, or the
				   knowledge of the things of divinity; for the knowledge of these things
				   is the principal end of this faculty. God gave man the faculty of
				   understanding, chiefly, that he might understand divine things.
				</p><p>
				   The wiser heathens were sensible that the main business of man was the
				   improvement and exercise of his understanding. But they were in the
				   dark, as they knew not the object about which the understanding should
				   chiefly be employed. That science which many of them thought should
				   chiefly employ the understanding, was philosophy; and accordingly they
				   made it their chief business to study it. But we who enjoy the light of
				   the gospel are more happy, we are not left, as to this particular, in
				   the dark. God hath told us about what things we should chiefly employ
				   our understandings, having given us a book full of divine instructions,
				   holding forth many glorious objects about which all rational creatures
				   should chiefly employ their understandings. These instructions are
				   accommodated to persons of all capacities and conditions, and proper to
				   be studied, not only by men of learning, but by persons of every
				   character, learned and unlearned, young and old, men and women.
				   Therefore the acquisition of knowledge in these things should be a main
				   business of all those who have the advantage of enjoying the Holy
				   Scriptures.
				</p><p>
				   (2.) The things of divinity are things of superlative excellency, and
				   are worthy that all should make a business of endeavoring to grow in
				   the knowledge of them. There are no things so worthy to be known as
				   these things. They are as much above those things which are treated of
				   in other sciences, as heaven is above the earth. God himself, the
				   eternal Three in one, is the chief object of this science: in the next
				   place, Jesus Christ, as Godman and Mediator, and the glorious work of
				   redemption, the most glorious work that ever was wrought: then the
				   great things of the heavenly world, the glorious and eternal
				   inheritance purchased by Christ, and promised in the gospel; the work
				   of the Holy Spirit of God on the hearts of men; our duty to God, and
				   the way in which we ourselves may become like angels, and like God
				   himself in our measure: all these are objects of this science.
				</p><p>
				   Such things as these have been the main subject of the study of the
				   holy patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, and the most excellent men
				   that ever were in the world, and are also the subject of the study of
				   the angels in heaven; <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.10 1Pet.1.11 1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:10-12</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   These things are so excellent and worthy to be known, that the
				   knowledge of them will richly pay for all the pains and labor of an
				   earnest seeking of it. If there were a great treasure of gold and
				   pearls hid in the earth, but should accidentally be found, and should
				   be opened among us with such circumstances that all might have as much
				   as they could gather of it; would not every one think it worth his
				   while to make a business of gathering it while it should last? But that
				   treasure of divine knowledge, which is contained in the Scriptures, and
				   is provided for every one to gather to himself as much of it as he can,
				   is a far more rich treasure than any one of gold and pearls. How busy
				   are all sorts of men, all over the world, in getting riches! But this
				   knowledge is a far better kind of riches, than that after which they so
				   diligently and laboriously pursue.
				</p><p>
				   3. The things of divinity not only concern ministers, but are of
				   infinite importance to all Christians. It is not with the doctrines of
				   divinity as it is with the doctrines of philosophy and other sciences.
				   These last are generally speculative points, which are of little
				   concern in human life; and it very little alters the case as to our
				   temporal or spiritual interests, whether we know them or not.
				   Philosophers differ about them, some being of one opinion, and others
				   of another. And while they are engaged in warm disputes about them,
				   others may well leave them to dispute among themselves, without
				   troubling their heads much about them; it being of little concern to
				   them, whether the one or the other be in the right.
				</p><p>
				   But it is not thus in matters of divinity. The doctrines: this nearly
				   concern every one. They are about those things which relate to every
				   man's eternal salvation and happiness. The common people cannot say,
				   Let us leave these matters to ministers and divines; let them dispute
				   them out among themselves as they can; they concern not us: for they
				   are of infinite importance to every man. Those doctrines of divinity
				   which relate to the essence, attributes, and subsistencies of God,
				   concern all; as it is of infinite importance to common people, as well
				   as to ministers, to know what kind of being God is. For he is the Being
				   who hath made us all, "in whom we live, and move, and have our being;"
				   who is the Lord of all; the Being to whom we are all accountable; is
				   the last end of our being, and the only fountain of our happiness.
				</p><p>
				   The doctrines also which relate to Jesus Christ and his mediation, his
				   incarnation, his life and death, his resurrection and ascension, his
				   sitting at the right hand of the Father, his satisfaction and
				   intercession, infinitely concern common people as well as divines. They
				   stand in as much need of this Saviour, and of an interest in his person
				   and offices, and the things which he hath done and suffered, as
				   ministers and divines.
				</p><p>
				   The same may be said of the doctrines which relate to the manner of a
				   sinner's justification, or the way in which he becomes interested in
				   the mediation of Christ. They equally concern all; for all stand in
				   equal necessity of justification before God. That eternal condemnation,
				   to which we are all naturally exposed, is equally dreadful. So with
				   respect to those doctrines of divinity, which relate to the work of the
				   Spirit of God on the heart, in the application of redemption in our
				   effectual calling and sanctification, all are equally concerned in
				   them. There is no doctrine of divinity whatever, which doth not some
				   way or other concern the eternal interest of every Christian. None of
				   the things which God hath taught us in his word are needless
				   speculations, or trivial matters; all of them are indeed important
				   points.
				</p><p>
				   4. We may argue from the great things which God hath done in order to
				   give us instruction in these things. As to other sciences, he hath left
				   us to ourselves, to the light of our own reason. But the things of
				   divinity being of infinitely greater importance to us, he hath not left
				   us to an uncertain guide; but hath himself given us a revelation of the
				   truth in these matters, and hath done very great things to convey and
				   confirm to us this revelation; raising up many prophets in different
				   ages, immediately inspiring them with his Holy Spirit, and confirming
				   their doctrine with innumerable miracles or wonderful works out of the
				   established course of nature. Yea, he raised up a succession of
				   prophets, which was upheld for several ages.
				</p><p>
				   It was very much for this end that God separated the people of Israel,
				   in so wonderful a manner, from all other people, and kept them
				   separate; that to them he might commit the oracles of God, and that
				   from them they might be communicated to the world. He hath also often
				   sent angels to bring divine instructions to men; and hath often himself
				   appeared to men in miraculous symbols or representations of his
				   presence; and now in these last days hath sent his own Son into the
				   world, to be his great prophet, to teach us divinity; Heb. 1 at the
				   beginning. By means of all, God hath given a book of divine
				   instructions, which contains the sum of divinity. Now, these things
				   hath God done not only for the instruction of ministers and men of
				   learning; but for the instruction of all men, of all sorts, learned and
				   unlearned, men, women, and children. And certainly if God doth such
				   great things to teach us, we ought not to do little to learn.
				</p><p>
				   God hath not made giving instructions to men in things of divinity a
				   business by the by; but a business which he hath undertaken and
				   prosecuted in a course of great and wonderful dispensations, as an
				   affair in which his heart hath been greatly engaged; which is sometimes
				   in Scripture signified by the expression of God's rising early to teach
				   us, and to send prophets and teachers to us. <reference osisRef="Jer.7.25">Jeremiah 7:25</reference>, "Since that day
				   that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, I
				   have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up
				   early and sending them" And so, verse 13, "I spake unto you, rising up
				   early, and speaking." This is a figurative speech, signifying, that God
				   hath not done this as a by business, but as a business of great
				   importance, in which he took great care, and had his heart much
				   engaged; because persons are wont to rise early to prosecute such
				   business as they are earnestly engaged in.- If God hath been so
				   engaged in teaching, certainly we should not be negligent in learning;
				   nor should we make growing in knowledge a by business, but a great part
				   of the business of our lives.
				</p><p>
				   5. It may be argued from the abundance of the instructions which God
				   hath given us, from the largeness of that book which God hath given to
				   teach us divinity, and from the great variety that is therein
				   contained. Much was taught by Moses of old, which we have transmitted
				   down to us; after that, other books were from time to time added; much
				   is taught us by David and Solomon; and many and excellent are the
				   instructions communicated by the prophets: yet God did not think all
				   this enough, but after this sent Christ and his apostles, by whom there
				   is added a great and excellent treasure to that holy book, which is to
				   be our rule in the study of divinity.
				</p><p>
				   This book was written for the use of all; all are directed to search
				   the Scriptures. <reference osisRef="John.5.39">John 5:39</reference>, "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think
				   ye have eternal life; and they are they that testify of me;" and <reference osisRef="Isa.34.16">Isaiah 34:16</reference>, "Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and read." They that read
				   and understand are pronounced blessed. <reference osisRef="Rev.1.3">Revelation of John 1:3</reference>, "Blessed is he that
				   readeth, and they that understand the words of this prophecy." If this
				   be true of that particular book of the Revelation, much more is it true
				   of the Bible in general. Nor is it to be believed that God would have
				   given instructions in such abundance, if he had intended that receiving
				   instruction should be only a by concernment with us.
				</p><p>
				   It is to be considered, that all those abundant instructions which are
				   contained in the Scriptures were written for that end, that they might
				   be understood; otherwise they are not instructions. That which is not
				   given that the learner may understand it, is not given for the
				   learner's instruction; and unless we endeavor to grow in the knowledge
				   of divinity, a very great part of those instructions will to us be in
				   vain; for we can receive benefit by no more of the Scriptures than we
				   understand, no more than if they were locked up in an unknown tongue.
				   We have reason to bless God that he hath given us such various and
				   plentiful instruction in his word; but we shall be hypocritical in so
				   doing, if we, after all, content ourselves with but little of this
				   instruction.
				</p><p>
				   When God hath opened a very large treasure before us, for the supply of
				   our wants, and we thank him that he hath given us so much; if at the
				   same time we be willing to remain destitute of the greatest part of it,
				   because we are too lazy to gather it, this will not show the sincerity
				   of our thankfulness. We are now under much greater advantages to
				   acquire knowledge in divinity, than the people of God were of old,
				   because since that time, the canon of Scripture is much increased. But
				   if we be negligent of our advantages, we may be never the better for
				   them, and may remain with as little knowledge as they.
				</p><p>
				   6. However diligently we apply ourselves, there is room enough to
				   increase our knowledge in divinity, without coming to an end. None have
				   this excuse to make for not diligently applying themselves to gain
				   knowledge in divinity, that they know all already; nor can they make
				   this excuse, that they have no need diligently to apply themselves, in
				   order to know all that is to be known. None can excuse themselves for
				   want of business in which to employ themselves. Here is room enough to
				   employ ourselves forever in this divine science, with the utmost
				   application. Those who have applied themselves most closely, have
				   studied the longest, and have made the greatest attainments in this
				   knowledge, know but little of what is to be known. The subject is
				   inexhaustible. That divine Being, who is the main subject of this
				   science, is infinite, and there is no end to the glory of his
				   perfections. His works at the same time are wonderful, and cannot be
				   found out to perfection; especially the work of redemption, which is
				   that work of God about which the science of divinity is chiefly
				   conversant, is full of unsearchable wonders.
				</p><p>
				   The word of God, which is given for our instruction in divinity,
				   contains enough in it to employ us to the end of our lives, and then we
				   shall leave enough uninvestigated to employ the heads of the ablest
				   divines to the end of the world. The Psalmist found an end to the
				   things that are human; but he could never find an end to what is
				   contained in the word of God; <reference osisRef="Ps.119.96">Psalms 119:96</reference>, "I have seen an end to all
				   perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding broad." There is enough in
				   this divine science to employ the understandings of saints and angels
				   to all eternity.
				</p><p>
				   7. It doubtless concerns every one to endeavor to excel in the
				   knowledge of things which pertain to his profession or principal
				   calling. If it concerns men to excel in any thing or in any wisdom or
				   knowledge at all, it certainly concerns them to excel in the affairs of
				   their main profession and work. But the calling and work of every
				   Christian is to live to God. This is said to be his high calling,
				   <reference osisRef="Phil.3.14">Philippians 3:14</reference>. This is the business, and, if I may so speak, the trade of a
				   Christian, his main work, and indeed should be his only work. No
				   business should be done by a Christian, but as it is some way or other
				   a part of this. Therefore certainly the Christian should endeavor to be
				   well acquainted with those things which belong to this work, that he
				   may fulfill it, and be thoroughly furnished to it.
				</p><p>
				   It becomes one who is called to be a soldier, and to go a warfare, to
				   endeavor to excel in the art of war. It becomes one who is called to be
				   a mariner, and to spend his life in sailing the ocean, to endeavor to
				   excel in the art of navigation. It becomes one who professes to be a
				   physician, and devotes himself to that work, to endeavor to excel in
				   the knowledge of those things which pertain to the art of physic. So it
				   becomes all such as profess to be Christians, and to devote themselves
				   to the practice of Christianity, to endeavor to excel in the knowledge
				   of divinity.
				</p><p>
				   8. It may be argued from this, that God hath appointed an order of men
				   for this end, to assist persons in gaining knowledge in these things.
				   He hath appointed them to be teachers. <reference osisRef="1Cor.12.28">1 Corinthians 12:28</reference>, "And God hath set
				   some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly
				   teachers." <reference osisRef="Eph.4.11 Eph.4.12">Ephesians 4:11-12</reference>, "He gave some apostles, some prophets, some
				   evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the
				   saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
				   Christ." If God hath set them to be teachers, making that their
				   business, then he hath made it their business to impart knowledge. But
				   what kind of knowledge? Not the knowledge of philosophy, or of human
				   laws, or of mechanical arts, but of divinity.
				</p><p>
				   If God hath made it the business of some to be teachers, it will
				   follow, that he hath made it the business of others to be learners; for
				   teachers and learners are correlates, one of which was never intended
				   to be without the other. God hath never made it the duty of some to
				   take pains to teach those who are not obliged to take pains to learn.
				   He hath not commanded ministers to spend themselves, in order to impart
				   knowledge to those who are not obliged to apply themselves to receive
				   it.
				</p><p>
				   The name by which Christians are commonly called in the New Testament
				   is disciples, the signification of which word is scholars or learners.
				   All Christians are put into the school of Christ, where their business
				   is to learn, or receive knowledge from Christ, their common master and
				   teacher, and from those inferior teachers appointed by him to instruct
				   in his name.
				</p><p>
				   9. God hath in the Scriptures plainly revealed it to be his will, that
				   all Christians should diligently endeavor to excel in the knowledge of
				   divine things. It is the revealed will of God, that Christians should
				   not only have some knowledge of things of this nature, but that they
				   should be enriched with all knowledge: <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.4 1Cor.1.5">1 Corinthians 1:4-5</reference>, "I thank my God
				   always on your behalf, for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus
				   Christ, that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
				   and in all knowledge." So the apostle earnestly prayed, that the
				   Christian Philippians might abound more and more, not only in love, but
				   in Christian knowledge: <reference osisRef="Phil.1.9">Philippians 1:9</reference>, "And this I pray, that your love
				   may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment." So the
				   Apostle Peter advises to "give all diligence, to add to faith virtue,
				   and to virtue knowledge," <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.5">2 Peter 1:5</reference>. And the Apostle Paul, in the next
				   chapter to that wherein is the text, counsels the Christian Hebrews,
				   leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, to go on to
				   perfection. He would by no means have them always to rest only in those
				   fundamental doctrines of repentance, and faith, and the resurrection
				   from the dead, and the eternal judgment, in which they were
				   indoctrinated when they were first baptized, and had the apostle's
				   hands laid on them, at their first initiation in Christianity. See Heb.
				   6, at the beginning.
				</p><p>
				   Application
				</p><p>
				   The use that I would make of this doctrine is, to exhort all diligently
				   to endeavor to gain this kind of knowledge.
				</p><p>
				   Consider yourselves as scholars or disciples, put into the school of
				   Christ, and therefore be diligent to make proficiency in Christian
				   knowledge. Content not yourselves with this, that you have been taught
				   your catechism in your childhood, and that you know as much of the
				   principles of religion as is necessary to salvation. So you will be
				   guilty of what the apostle warns against, viz., going no further than
				   laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, &c.
				</p><p>
				   You are all called to be Christians, and this is your profession.
				   Endeavor, therefore, to acquire knowledge in things which pertain to
				   your profession.- Let not your teachers have cause to complain, that
				   while they spend and are spent, to impart knowledge to you, you take
				   little pains to learn. It is a great encouragement to an instructor, to
				   have such to teach as make a business of learning, bending their minds
				   to it. This makes teaching a pleasure, when otherwise it will be a very
				   heavy and burdensome task.
				</p><p>
				   You all have by you a large treasure of divine knowledge, in that you
				   have the Bible in your hands; therefore be not contented in possessing
				   but little of this treasure. God hath spoken much to you in the
				   Scripture; labor to understand as much of what he saith as you can. God
				   hath made you all reasonable creatures; therefore let not the noble
				   faculty of reason or understanding lie neglected. Content not
				   yourselves with having so much knowledge as is thrown in your way, and
				   as you receive in some sense unavoidably by the frequent inculcation of
				   divine truth in the preaching of the word, of which you are obliged to
				   be hearers, or as you accidentally gain in conversation; but let it be
				   very much your business to search for it, and that with the same
				   diligence and labor with which men are wont to dig in mines of silver
				   and gold.
				</p><p>
				   Especially I would advise those that are young to employ themselves in
				   this way. Men are never too old to learn; but the time of youth is
				   especially the time for learning; it is especially proper for gaining
				   and storing up knowledge. Further, to stir up all, both old and young,
				   to this duty, let me entreat you to consider,
				</p><p>
				   1. If you apply yourselves diligently to this work, you will not want
				   employment, when you are at leisure from your common secular business.
				   In this way, you may find something in which you may profitably employ
				   yourselves these long winter evenings. You will find something else to
				   do, besides going about from house to house, spending one hour after
				   another in unprofitable conversation, or, at best, to no other purpose
				   but to amuse yourselves, to fill up and wear away your time. And it is
				   to be feared that very much of the time that is spent in our winter
				   evening visits, is spent to a much worse purpose than that which I have
				   now mentioned. Solomon tells us, <reference osisRef="Prov.10.19">Proverbs 10:19</reference>, "That in the multitude of
				   words, there wanteth not sin." And is not this verified in those who
				   find nothing else to do for so great a part of the winter, but to go to
				   one another's houses, and spend the time in such talk as comes next, or
				   such as any one's present disposition happens to suggest? Some
				   diversion is doubtless lawful; but for Christians to spend so much of
				   their time, so many long evenings, in no other conversation than that
				   which tends to divert and amuse, if nothing worse, is a sinful way of
				   spending time, and tends to poverty of soul at least, if not to outward
				   poverty: <reference osisRef="Prov.14.23">Proverbs 14:23</reference>, "In all labor there is profit; but the talk of
				   the lips tendeth only to penury!" Besides, when persons for so much of
				   their time have nothing else to do but to sit, and talk, and chat in
				   one another's chimney corners, there is great danger of falling into
				   foolish and sinful conversation, venting their corrupt dispositions, in
				   talking against others, expressing their jealousies and evil surmises
				   concerning their neighbors; not considering what Christ hath said,
				   <reference osisRef="Matt.12.36">Matthew 12:36</reference>, "Of every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
				   account in the day of judgment." If you would comply with what you have
				   heard from this doctrine, you would find something else to spend your
				   winters in, one winter after another, besides contention, or talking
				   about those public affairs which tend to contention. Young people might
				   find something else to do, besides spending their time in vain company;
				   something that would be much more profitable to themselves, as it would
				   really turn to some good account; something, in doing which they would
				   both be more out of the devil's way, the way of temptation, and be more
				   in the way of duty, and of a divine blessing. And even aged people
				   would have something to employ themselves in after they are become
				   incapable of bodily labor. Their time, as is now often the case, would
				   not lie heavy upon their hands, as they would, with both profit and
				   pleasure, be engaged in searching the Scriptures, and in comparing and
				   meditating upon the various truths which they should find there.
				</p><p>
				   2. This would be a noble way of spending your time. The Holy Spirit
				   gives the Bereans this epithet, because they diligently employed
				   themselves in this business: <reference osisRef="Acts.17.11">Acts 17:11</reference>, "These were more noble than
				   those of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
				   readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those
				   things ere so." This is very much the employment of heaven. The
				   inhabitants of that world spend much of their time in searching into
				   the great things of divinity, and endeavoring to acquire knowledge in
				   them, as we are told of the angels, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference>, "Which things the
				   angels desire to look into." This will be very agreeable to what you
				   hope will be your business to all eternity, as you doubtless hope to
				   join in the same employment with the angels of light. Solomon says,
				   <reference osisRef="Prov.25.2">Proverbs 25:2</reference>, "It is the honor of kings to search out a matter;" and
				   certainly, above all others, to search out divine matters. Now if this
				   be the honor even of kings, is it not equally, if not much more, your
				   honor?
				</p><p>
				   3. This is a pleasant way of improving time. Knowledge is pleasant and
				   delightful to intelligent creatures, and above all the knowledge of
				   divine things; for in them are the most excellent truths, and the most
				   beautiful and amiable objects held forth to view. However tedious the
				   labor necessarily attending this business may be, yet the knowledge
				   once obtained will richly requite the pains taken to obtain it. "When
				   wisdom entereth the heart, knowledge is pleasant to the soul," <reference osisRef="Prov.2.10">Proverbs 2:10</reference>.
				</p><p>
				   4. This knowledge is exceeding useful in Christian practice. Such as
				   have much knowledge in divinity have great means and advantages for
				   spiritual and saving knowledge; for no means of grace, as was said
				   before, have their effect on the heart, otherwise than by the knowledge
				   they impart. The more you have of a rational knowledge of the things of
				   the gospel, the more opportunity will there be, when the Spirit shall
				   be breathed into your heart, to see the excellency of these things, and
				   to taste the sweetness of them. The Heathens, who have no rational
				   knowledge of the things of the gospel, have no opportunity to see the
				   excellency of them; and therefore the more rational knowledge of these
				   things you have, the more opportunity and advantage you have to see the
				   divine excellency and glory of them.
				</p><p>
				   Again, The more knowledge you have of divine things, the better will
				   you know your duty; your knowledge will be of great use to direct you
				   as to your duty in particular cases. You will also be the better
				   furnished against the temptations of the devil. For the devil often
				   takes the advantage of persons' ignorance to ply them with temptations
				   which otherwise would have no hold of them. By having much knowledge,
				   you will be under greater advantages to conduct yourselves with
				   prudence and discretion in your Christian course, and so to live much
				   more to the honor of God and religion. Many who mean well, and are full
				   of a good spirit, yet, for want of prudence, conduct themselves so as
				   to wound religion. Many have a zeal of God, which doth more hurt than
				   good, because it is not according to knowledge, <reference osisRef="Rom.10.2">Romans 10:2</reference>. The reason
				   why many good men behave no better in many instances, is not so much
				   that they want grace, as that they want knowledge.
				</p><p>
				   Besides, an increase of knowledge would be a great help to profitable
				   conversation. It would supply you with matter for conversation when you
				   come together, or when you visit your neighbors: and so you would have
				   less temptation to spend the time in such conversation as tends to your
				   own and others' hurt.
				</p><p>
				   5. Consider the advantages you are under to grow in the knowledge of
				   divinity. We are under far greater advantages to gain much knowledge in
				   divinity now, than God's people under the Old Testament, both because
				   the canon of Scripture is so much enlarged since that time, and also
				   because evangelical truths are now so much more plainly revealed. So
				   that common men are now in some respects under advantages to know more
				   of divinity, than the greatest prophets were then. Thus that saying of
				   Christ is in a sense applicable to us, <reference osisRef="Luke.10.23 Luke.10.24">Luke 10:23-24</reference>, "Blessed are the
				   eyes which see the things which ye see. For I tell you, that many
				   prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and
				   have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have
				   not heard them." We are in some respects under far greater advantages
				   for gaining knowledge, now in these latter ages of the church, than
				   Christians were formerly; especially by reason of the art of printing,
				   of which God hath given us the benefit, whereby Bibles and other books
				   of divinity are exceedingly multiplied, and persons may now be
				   furnished with helps for the obtaining of Christian knowledge, at a
				   much easier and cheaper rate than they formerly could.
				</p><p>
				   6. We know not what opposition we may meet with in the principles which
				   we hold in divinity. We know that there are many adversaries to the
				   gospel and its truths. if therefore we embrace those truths, we must
				   expect to be attacked by the said adversaries; and unless we be well
				   informed concerning divine things, how shall we be able to defend
				   ourselves? Besides, the Apostle Peter enjoins it upon us, always to be
				   ready to give an answer to every man who asketh us a reason of the hope
				   that is in us. But this we cannot expect to do without a considerable
				   knowledge in divine things.
				</p><p>
				   I shall now conclude my discourse with some directions for the
				   acquisition of this knowledge.
				</p><p>
				   1. Be assiduous in reading the holy Scriptures. This is the fountain
				   whence all knowledge in divinity must be derived. Therefore let not
				   this treasure lie by you neglected. Every man of common understanding
				   who can read, may, if he please, become well acquainted with the
				   Scriptures. And what an excellent attainment would this be!
				</p><p>
				   2. Content not yourselves with only a cursory reading, without
				   regarding the sense. This is an ill way of reading, to which, however,
				   many accustom themselves all their days. When you read, observe what
				   you read. Observe how things come in. Take notice of the drift of the
				   discourse, and compare one Scripture with another. For the Scripture,
				   by the harmony of the different parts of it, casts great light upon
				   itself. We are expressly directed by Christ to search the Scriptures,
				   which evidently intends something more than a mere cursory reading. And
				   use means to find out the meaning of the Scripture. When you have it
				   explained in the preaching of the word, take notice of it; and if at
				   any time a Scripture that you did not understand be cleared up to your
				   satisfaction, mark it, lay it up, and if possible remember it.
				</p><p>
				   3. Procure, and diligently use other books which may help you to grow
				   in this knowledge. There are many excellent books extant, which might
				   greatly forward you in this knowledge, and afford you a very profitable
				   and pleasant entertainment in your leisure hours. There is doubtless a
				   great defect in many, that through a lothness to be at a little
				   expense, they furnish themselves with no more helps of this nature.
				   They have a few books indeed, which now and then on Sabbath days they
				   read; but they have had them so long, and read them so often, that they
				   are weary of them, and it is now become a dull story, a mere task to
				   read them.
				</p><p>
				   4. Improve conversation with others to this end. How much might persons
				   promote each other's knowledge in divine things, if they would improve
				   conversation as they might; if men that are ignorant were not ashamed
				   to show their ignorance, and were willing to learn of others; if those
				   that have knowledge would communicate it, without pride and
				   ostentation; and if all were more disposed to enter on such
				   conversation as would be for their mutual edification and instruction.
				</p><p>
				   5. Seek not to grow in knowledge chiefly for the sake of applause, and
				   to enable you to dispute with others; but seek it for the benefit of
				   your souls, and in order to practice. If applause be your end, you will
				   not be so likely to be led to the knowledge of the truth, but may
				   justly, as often is the case of those who are proud of their knowledge,
				   be led into error to your own perdition. This being your end, if you
				   should obtain much rational knowledge, it would not be likely to be of
				   any benefit to you, but would puff you up with pride: <reference osisRef="1Cor.8.1">1 Corinthians 8:1</reference>,
				   "Knowledge puffeth up."
				</p><p>
				   6. Seek to God, that he would direct you, and bless you, in this
				   pursuit after knowledge. This is the apostle's direction, <reference osisRef="Jas.1.5">James 1:5</reference>:
				   "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all
				   liberally, and upbraideth not." God is the fountain of all divine
				   knowledge. <reference osisRef="Prov.2.6">Proverbs 2:6</reference>, "The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh
				   knowledge and understanding." Labor to be sensible of your own
				   blindness and ignorance, and your need of the help of God, lest you be
				   led into error, instead of true knowledge. <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.18">1 Corinthians 3:18</reference>, "If any man
				   would be wise, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
				</p><p>
				   8. (sic) Practice according to what knowledge you have. This will be
				   the way to know more. The Psalmist warmly recommends this way of
				   seeking knowledge in divinity, from his own experience: <reference osisRef="Ps.119.100">Psalms 119:100</reference>,
				   "I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts."
				   Christ also recommends the same: <reference osisRef="John.7.17">John 7:17</reference>, "If any man will do his
				   will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I
				   speak of myself."
				</p>

				<title>The Excellency of Christ</title>
				<p>				
				  a Sermon by Jonathan Edwards
				</p><p>
				    <reference osisRef="Rev.5.5 Rev.5.6">Revelation of John 5:5-6</reference>: "And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the
				    tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to
				    loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the
				    throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb
				    as it had been slain.
				</p><p>
				 <hi type="bold">Introduction</hi>
				</p><p>
				   The visions and revelations the apostle John had of the future events
				   of God's providence, are here introduced with a vision of the book of
				   God's decrees, by which those events were fore-ordained. This is
				   represented (<reference osisRef="Rev.5.1">Revelation of John 5:1</reference>) as a book in the right hand of him who sat
				   on the throne, "written within and on the back side, and sealed with
				   seven seals." Books, in the form in which they were wont of old to be
				   made, were broad leaves of parchment or paper, or something of that
				   nature, joined together at one edge, and so rolled up together, and
				   then sealed, or some way fastened together, to prevent their unfolding
				   and opening. Hence we read of the roll of a book <reference osisRef="Jer.36.2">Jeremiah 36:2</reference>. It seems to
				   have been such a book that John had a vision of here; and therefore it
				   is said to be "written within and on the back side," i. e. on the
				   inside pages, and also on one of the outside pages, namely, that which
				   it was rolled in, in rolling the book up together. And it is said to be
				   "sealed with seven seals," to signify that what was written in it was
				   perfectly hidden and secret; or that God's decrees of future events are
				   sealed, and shut up from all possibility of being discovered by
				   creatures, till God is pleased to make them known. We find that seven
				   is often used in Scripture as the number of perfection, to signify the
				   superlative or most perfect degree of anything, which probably arose
				   from this, that on the seventh day God beheld the works of creation
				   finished, and rested and rejoiced in them, as being complete and
				   perfect.
				</p><p>
				   When John saw this book, he tells us, he "saw a strong angel
				   proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to
				   loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither
				   under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon."
				   And that he wept much, because "no man was found worthy to open and
				   read the book, neither to look thereon." And then tells us how his
				   tears were dried up, namely, that "one of the elders said unto him,
				   "Weep not, Behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed" etc.
				   as in the text. Though no man nor angel, nor any mere creature, was
				   found either able to loose the seals, or worthy to be admitted to the
				   privilege of reading the book, yet this was declared, for the comfort
				   of this beloved disciple, that Christ was found both able and worthy.
				   And we have an account in the succeeding chapters how he actually did
				   it, opening the seals in order, first one, and then another, revealing
				   what God had decreed should come to pass hereafter. And we have an
				   account in this chapter, of his coming and taking the book out of the
				   right hand of him that sat on the throne, and of the joyful praises
				   that were sung to him in heaven and earth on that occasion.
				</p><p>
				   Many things might be observed in the words of the text; but it is to my
				   present purpose only to take notice of the two distinct appellations
				   here given to Christ.
				    1. He is called a Lion. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. He
				       seems to be called the Lion of the tribe of Judah, in allusion to
				       what Jacob said in his blessing of the tribe on his death-bed; who,
				       when he came to bless Judah, compares him to a lion, <reference osisRef="Gen.49.9">Genesis 49:9</reference>.
				       "Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:
				       he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who
				       shall rouse him up?" And also to the standard of the camp of Judah
				       in the wilderness on which was displayed a lion, according to the
				       ancient tradition of the Jews. It is much on account of the valiant
				       acts of David that the tribe of Judah, of which David was, is in
				       Jacob's prophetical blessing compared to a lion; but more
				       especially with an eye to Jesus Christ, who also was of that tribe,
				       and was descended of David, and is in our text called "the Root of
				       David"; and therefore Christ is here called "the Lion of the tribe
				       of Judah."
				    2. He is called a Lamb. John was told of a Lion that had prevailed to
				       open the book, and probably expected to see a lion in his vision;
				       but while he is expecting, behold a Lamb appears to open the book,
				       an exceeding diverse kind of creature from a lion. A lion is a
				       devourer, one that is wont to make terrible slaughter of others;
				       and no creature more easily falls a prey to him than a lamb. And
				       Christ is here represented not only as a Lamb, a creature very
				       liable to be slain, but a "Lamb as it had been slain," that is,
				       with the marks of its deadly wounds appearing on it.
				</p><p>
				   That which I would observe from the words, for the subject of my
				   present discourse, is this, namely -
				</p><p>
				   There is an admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies in Jesus
				   Christ.
				</p><p>
				   The lion and the lamb, though very diverse kinds of creatures, yet have
				   each their peculiar excellencies. The lion excels in strength, and in
				   the majesty of his appearance and voice: the lamb excels in meekness
				   and patience, besides the excellent nature of the creature as good for
				   food, and yielding that which is fit for our clothing and being
				   suitable to be offered in sacrifice to God. But we see that Christ is
				   in the text compared to both, because the diverse excellencies of both
				   wonderfully meet in him, - In handling this subject I would
				</p><p>
				   [42]First, Show wherein there is an admirable conjunction of diverse
				   excellencies in Christ.
				   [43]Second, Show how this admirable conjunction of excellencies appear
				   in Christ's acts.
				   [44]Third, make application.
				</p><p>
				<hi type="bold">Part One</hi>
				</p><p>
				   First, I would show wherein there is an admirable conjunction of
				   diverse excellencies in Jesus Christ. which appears in three things:
				</p><p>
				   [45]A) There is a conjunction of such excellencies in Christ, as, in
				   our manner of conceiving, are very diverse one from another.
				</p><p>
				   [46]B) There is in him a conjunction of such really diverse
				   excellencies, as otherwise would have seemed to us utterly incompatible
				   in the same subject.
				</p><p>
				   [47]C) Such diverse excellencies are exercised in him towards men that
				   otherwise would have seemed impossible to be exercised towards the same
				   object.
				</p><p>
				   A) There is a conjunction of such excellencies in Christ as, in our
				   manner of conceiving, are very diverse one from another. Such are the
				   various divine perfections and excellencies that Christ is possessed
				   of. Christ is a divine person, and therefore has all the attributes of
				   God. The difference between these is chiefly relative, and in our
				   manner of conceiving them. And those which, in this sense, are most
				   diverse, meet in the person of Christ. I shall mention two instances.
				</p><p>
				    1. There do meet in Jesus Christ infinite highness and infinite
				       condescension.
				</p><p>
				       Christ, as he is God, is infinitely great and high above all. He is
				       higher than the kings of the earth; for he is King of kings, and
				       Lord of lords. He is higher than the heavens, and higher than the
				       highest angels of heaven. So great is he, that all men, all kings
				       and princes, are as worms of the dust before him; all nations are
				       as the drop of the bucket, and the light dust of the balance; yea,
				       and angels themselves are as nothing before him. He is so high,
				       that he is infinitely above any need of us; above our reach, that
				       we cannot be profitable to him; and above our conceptions, that we
				       cannot comprehend him. <reference osisRef="Prov.30.4">Proverbs 30:4</reference> "What is his name, and what is
				       his Son's name, if thou canst tell?" Our understandings, if we
				       stretch them never so far, cannot reach up to his divine glory. <reference osisRef="Job.11.8">Job 11:8</reference> "It is high as heaven, what canst thou do?" Christ is the
				       Creator and great Possessor of heaven and earth. He is sovereign
				       Lord of all. He rules over the whole universe, and doth whatsoever
				       pleaseth him. His knowledge is without bound. His wisdom is
				       perfect, and what none can circumvent. His power is infinite, and
				       none can resist Him. His riches are immense and inexhaustible. His
				       majesty is infinitely awful.
				</p><p>
				       And yet he is one of infinite condescension. None are so low or
				       inferior, but Christ's condescension is sufficient to take a
				       gracious notice of them. He condescends not only to the angels,
				       humbling himself to behold the things that are done in heaven, but
				       he also condescends to such poor creatures as men; and that not
				       only so as to take notice of princes and great men, but of those
				       that are of meanest rank and degree, "the poor of the world," <reference osisRef="Jas.2.5">James 2:5</reference>. Such as are commonly despised by their fellow creatures,
				       Christ does not despise. <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.28">1 Corinthians 1:28</reference> "Base things of the world, and
				       things that are despised, hath God chosen." Christ condescends to
				       take notice of beggars <reference osisRef="Luke.16.22">Luke 16:22</reference> and people of the most despised
				       nations. In Christ Jesus is neither "Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor
				       free" (<reference osisRef="Col.3.11">Colossians 3:11</reference>). He that is thus high condescends to take a
				       gracious notice of little children <reference osisRef="Matt.19.14">Matthew 19:14</reference>. "Suffer little
				       children to come unto me." Yea, which is more, his condescension is
				       sufficient to take a gracious notice of the most unworthy, sinful
				       creatures, those that have no good deservings, and those that have
				       infinite ill deservings.
				</p><p>
				       Yea, so great is his condescension, that it is not only sufficient
				       to take some gracious notice of such as these, but sufficient for
				       every thing that is an act of condescension. His condescension is
				       great enough to become their friend, to become their companion, to
				       unite their souls to him in spiritual marriage. It is enough to
				       take their nature upon him, to become one of them, that he may be
				       one with them. Yea, it is great enough to abase himself yet lower
				       for them, even to expose himself to shame and spitting; yea, to
				       yield up himself to an ignominious death for them. And what act of
				       condescension can be conceived of greater? Yet such an act as this,
				       has his condescension yielded to, for those that are so low and
				       mean, despicable and unworthy!
				</p><p>
				       Such a conjunction of infinite highness and low condescension, in
				       the same person, is admirable. We see, by manifold instances, what
				       a tendency a high station has in men, to make them to be of a quite
				       contrary disposition. If one worm be a little exalted above
				       another, by having more dust, or a bigger dunghill, how much does
				       he make of himself! What a distance does he keep from those that
				       are below him! And a little condescension is what he expects should
				       be made much of, and greatly acknowledged. Christ condescends to
				       wash our feet; but how would great men, (or rather the bigger
				       worms,) account themselves debased by acts of far less
				       condescension!
				</p><p>
				    2. There meet in Jesus Christ, infinite justice and infinite grace.
				       As Christ is a divine person, he is infinitely holy and just,
				       hating sin, and disposed to execute condign punishment for sin. He
				       is the Judge of the world, and the infinitely just Judge of it, and
				       will not at all acquit the wicked, or by any means clear the
				       guilty.
				</p><p>
				       And yet he is infinitely gracious and merciful. Though his justice
				       be so strict with respect to all sin, and every breach of the law,
				       yet he has grace sufficient for every sinner, and even the chief of
				       sinners. And it is not only sufficient for the most unworthy to
				       show them mercy, and bestow some good upon them, but to bestow the
				       greatest good; yea, it is sufficient to bestow all good upon them,
				       and to do all things for them. There is no benefit or blessing that
				       they can receive, so great but the grace of Christ is sufficient to
				       bestow it on the greatest sinner that ever lived. And not only so,
				       but so great is his grace, that nothing is too much as the means of
				       this good. It is sufficient not only to do great things, but also
				       to suffer in order to do it, and not only to suffer, but to suffer
				       most extremely even unto death, the most terrible of natural evils;
				       and not only death, but the most ignominious and tormenting, and
				       every way the most terrible that men could inflict; yea, and
				       greater sufferings than men could inflict, who could only torment
				       the body. He had sufferings in his soul, that were the more
				       immediate fruits of the wrath of God against the sins of those he
				       undertakes for.
				</p><p>
				       B) There do meet in the person of Christ such really diverse
				       excellencies, which otherwise would have been thought utterly
				       incompatible in the same subject; such as are conjoined in no other
				       person whatever, either divine, human, or angelical; and such as
				       neither men nor angels would ever have imagined could have met
				       together in the same person, had it not been seen in the person of
				       Christ. I would give some instances.
				</p><p>
				         1. In the person of Christ do meet together infinite glory and
				            lowest humility. Infinite glory, and the virtue of humility,
				            meet in no other person but Christ. They meet in no created
				            person; for no created person has infinite glory, and they
				            meet in no other divine person but Christ. For though the
				            divine nature be infinitely abhorrent to pride, yet humility
				            is not properly predicable of God the Father, and the Holy
				            Ghost, that exist only in the divine nature; because it is a
				            proper excellency only of a created nature; for it consists
				            radically in a sense of a comparative lowness and littleness
				            before God, or the great distance between God and the subject
				            of this virtue; but it would be a contradiction to suppose any
				            such thing in God.
				</p><p>
				            But in Jesus Christ, who is both God and man, those two
				            diverse excellencies are sweetly united. He is a person
				            infinitely exalted in glory and dignity. <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6">Philippians 2:6</reference>. "Being in
				            the form of God, he thought it not robbery to be equal with
				            God." There is equal honor due to him with the Father. <reference osisRef="John.5.23">John 5:23</reference>. "That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor
				            the Father." God himself says to him, "thy throne, O God, is
				            for ever and ever," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.8">Hebrews 1:8</reference>. And there is the same supreme
				            respect and divine worship paid to him by the angels of
				            heaven, as to God the Father, ver. 6. "Let all the angels of
				            God worship him."
				</p><p>
				            But however he is thus above all, yet he is lowest of all in
				            humility. There never was so great an instance of this virtue
				            among either men or angels, as Jesus. None ever was so
				            sensible of the distance between God and him, or had a heart
				            so lowly before God, as the man Christ Jesus. <reference osisRef="Matt.11.29">Matthew 11:29</reference>.
				            What a wonderful spirit of humility appeared in him, when he
				            was here upon earth, in all his behavior! In his contentment
				            in his mean outward condition, contentedly living in the
				            family of Joseph the carpenter, and Mary his mother, for
				            thirty years together, and afterwards choosing outward
				            meanness, poverty, and contempt, rather than earthly
				            greatness; in his washing his disciples' feet, and in all his
				            speeches and deportment towards them; in his cheerfully
				            sustaining the form of a servant through his whole life, and
				            submitting to such immense humiliation at death!
				</p><p>
				         2. In the person of Christ do meet together infinite majesty and
				            transcendent meekness. These again are two qualifications that
				            meet together in no other person but Christ. Meekness,
				            properly so called, is a virtue proper only to the creature:
				            we scarcely ever find meekness mentioned as a divine attribute
				            in Scripture; at least not in the New Testament; for thereby
				            seems to be signified, a calmness and quietness of spirit,
				            arising from humility in mutable beings that are naturally
				            liable to be put into a ruffle by the assaults of a
				            tempestuous and injurious world. But Christ, being both God
				            and man, hath both infinite majesty and superlative meekness.
				            Christ was a person of infinite majesty. It is he that is
				            spoken of, <reference osisRef="Ps.45.3">Psalms 45:3</reference>. "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most
				            mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty." It is he that is
				            mighty, that rideth on the heavens, and his excellency on the
				            sky. It is he that is terrible out of his holy places; who is
				            mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty
				            waves of the sea: before whom a fire goeth, and burneth up his
				            enemies round about; at whose presence the earth quakes, and
				            the hills melt; who sitteth on the circle of the earth, and
				            all the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers, who rebukes
				            the sea, and maketh it dry and drieth up the rivers, whose
				            eyes are as a flame of fire, from whose presence, and from the
				            glory of whose power, the wicked shall be punished with
				            everlasting destruction; who is the blessed and only
				            Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who hath
				            heaven for his throne, and the earth for his footstool, and is
				            the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose kingdom is
				            an everlasting kingdom, and of whose dominion there is no end.
				            And yet he was the most marvellous instance of meekness, and
				            humble quietness of spirit, that ever was; agreeable to the
				            prophecies of him, <reference osisRef="Matt.21.4">Matthew 21:4</reference>f "All this was done, that it
				            might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
				            Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
				            thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
				            ass." And, agreeable to what Christ declares of himself, <reference osisRef="Matt.11.29">Matthew 11:29</reference>. "I am meek and lowly in heart." And agreeable to what
				            was manifest in his behavior: for there never was such an
				            instance seen on earth, of a meek behavior, under injuries and
				            reproaches, and towards enemies; who, when he was reviled,
				            reviled not again. He had a wonderful spirit of forgiveness,
				            was ready to forgive his worst enemies, and prayed for them
				            with fervent and effectual prayers. With what meekness did he
				            appear in the ring of soldiers that were contemning and
				            mocking him; he was silent, and opened not his mouth, but went
				            as a lamb to the slaughter. Thus is Christ a Lion in majesty
				            and a Lamb in meekness.
				</p><p>
				         3. There meet in the person of Christ the deepest reverence
				            towards God and equality with God. Christ, when on earth,
				            appeared full of holy reverence towards the Father. He paid
				            the most reverential worship to him, praying to him with
				            postures of reverence. Thus we read of his "kneeling down and
				            praying," <reference osisRef="Luke.22.41">Luke 22:41</reference>. This became Christ, as one who had taken
				            on him the human nature, but at the same time he existed in
				            the divine nature; whereby his person was in all respects
				            equal to the person of the Father. God the Father hath no
				            attribute or perfection that the Son hath not, in equal
				            degree, and equal glory. These things meet in no other person
				            but Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
				         4. There are conjoined in the person of Christ infinite
				            worthiness of good, and the greatest patience under sufferings
				            of evil.
				</p><p>
				            He was perfectly innocent,and deserved no suffering. He
				            deserved nothing from God by any guilt of his own, and he
				            deserved no ill from men. Yea, he was not only harmless and
				            undeserving of suffering, but he was infinitely worthy; worthy
				            of the infinite love of the Father, worthy of infinite and
				            eternal happiness, and infinitely worthy of all possible
				            esteem, love, and service from all men.
				</p><p>
				            And yet he was perfectly patient under the greatest sufferings
				            that ever were endured in this world. <reference osisRef="Heb.12.2">Hebrews 12:2</reference>. "He endured
				            the cross, despising the shame." He suffered not from his
				            Father for his faults, but ours; and he suffered from men not
				            for his faults but for those things on account of which he was
				            infinitely worthy of their love and honor, which made his
				            patience the more wonderful and the more glorious. <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.20">1 Peter 2:20</reference>, "For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your
				            faults, ye shall take it patiently, but if when ye do well.
				            and suffer for it, ye take it patiently; this is acceptable
				            with God. For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ
				            also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should
				            follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in
				            his mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he
				            suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that
				            judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our sins in his own
				            body on the tree, that we being dead to sin, should live unto
				            righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed." There is no
				            such conjunction of innocence, worthiness, and patience under
				            sufferings, as in the person of Christ.
				</p><p>
				         5. In the person of Christ are conjoined an exceeding spirit of
				            obedience, with supreme dominion over heaven and earth.
				</p><p>
				            Christ is the Lord of all things in two respects: he is so, as
				            God-man and Mediator, and thus his dominion is appointed, and
				            given him of the Father. Having it by delegation from God, he
				            is as it were the Father's vicegerent. But he is Lord of all
				            things in another respect, namely, as he is (by his original
				            nature) God; and so he is by natural right the Lord of all,
				            and supreme over all as much as the Father. Thus, he has
				            dominion over the world, not by delegation, but in his own
				            right. He is not an under God, as the Arians suppose, but to
				            all intents and purposes supreme God.
				</p><p>
				            And yet in the same person is found the greatest spirit of
				            obedience to the commands and laws of God that ever was in the
				            universe; which was manifest in his obedience here in this
				            world. <reference osisRef="John.14.31">John 14:31</reference> "As the Father gave me commandment, even so
				            I do."- <reference osisRef="John.15.10">John 15:10</reference>. "Even as I have kept my Father's
				            commandments, and abide in his love." The greatness of his
				            obedience appears in its perfection, and in his obeying
				            commands of such exceeding difficulty. Never any one received
				            commands from God of such difficulty, and that were so great a
				            trial of obedience, as Jesus Christ. One of God's commands to
				            him was, that he should yield himself to those dreadful
				            sufferings that he underwent. See <reference osisRef="John.10.18">John 10:18</reference>. "No man taketh
				            it from me, but I lay it down of myself." "This commandment
				            received I of my Father." And Christ was thoroughly obedient
				            to this command of God. <reference osisRef="Heb.5.8">Hebrews 5:8</reference>. "Though he were a Son, yet
				            he learned obedience by the things that he suffered." <reference osisRef="Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:8</reference>. "He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even
				            the death of the cross." Never was there such an instance of
				            obedience in man or angel as this, though he was at the same
				            time supreme Lord of both angels and men.
				</p><p>
				         6. In the person of Christ are conjoined absolute sovereignty and
				            perfect resignation. This is another unparalleled conjunction.
				            Christ, as he is God, is the absolute sovereign of the world,
				            the sovereign disposer of all events. The decrees of God are
				            all his sovereign decrees; and the work of creation, and all
				            God's works of providence, are his sovereign works. It is he
				            that worketh all things according to the counsel of his own
				            will. <reference osisRef="Col.1.16">Colossians 1:16</reference>f. "By him, and through him, and to him, are all
				            things." <reference osisRef="John.5.17">John 5:17</reference>. "The Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
				            <reference osisRef="Matt.8.3">Matthew 8:3</reference>. "I will, be thou clean."
				</p><p>
				            But yet Christ was the most wonderful instance of resignation
				            that ever appeared in the world. He was absolutely and
				            perfectly resigned when he had a near and immediate prospect
				            of his terrible sufferings, and the dreadful cup that he was
				            to drink. The idea and expectation of this made his soul
				            exceeding sorrowful even unto death, and put him into such an
				            agony, that his sweat was as it were great drops or clots of
				            blood, falling down to the ground. But in such circumstances
				            he was wholly resigned to the will of God. <reference osisRef="Matt.26.39">Matthew 26:39</reference>. "O my
				            Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
				            nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt". Verse 42. "O
				            my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink
				            it, thy will be done."
				</p><p>
				         7. In Christ do meet together self-sufficiency, and an entire
				            trust and reliance on God, which is another conjunction
				            peculiar to the person of Christ.
				</p><p>
				            As he is a divine person, he is self-sufficient, standing in
				            need of nothing. All creatures are dependent on him, but he is
				            dependent on none, but is absolutely independent. His
				            proceeding from the Father, in his eternal generation, argues
				            no proper dependence on the will of the Father; for that
				            proceeding was natural and necessary, and not arbitrary.
				            But yet Christ entirely trusted in God: - his enemies say
				            that of him, "He trusted in God that he would deliver him,"
				            <reference osisRef="Matt.27.43">Matthew 27:43</reference>. And the apostle testifies, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.23">1 Peter 2:23</reference>. "That he
				            committed himself God."
				</p><p>
				       C) Such diverse excellencies are expressed in him towards men, that
				       otherwise would have seemed impossible to be exercised towards the
				       same object; as particularly these three, justice, mercy, and
				       truth. The same that are mentioned in <reference osisRef="Ps.85.10">Psalms 85:10</reference>. "Mercy and truth
				       are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other."
				       The strict justice of God, and even his revenging justice, and that
				       against the sins of men, never was so gloriously manifested. as in
				       Christ. He manifested an infinite regard to the attribute of God's
				       justice, in that, when he had a mind to save sinners, he was
				       willing to undergo such extreme sufferings, rather than that their
				       salvation should be to the injury of the honor of that attribute.
				       And as he is the Judge of the world, he doth himself exercise
				       strict justice, he will not clear the guilty, nor at all acquit the
				       wicked in judgment.
				</p><p>
				       Yet how wonderfully is infinite mercy towards sinners displayed in
				       him! And what glorious and ineffable grace and love have been and
				       are exercised by him, towards sinful men! Though he be the just
				       Judge of a sinful world, yet he is also the Savior of the world.
				       Though he be a consuming fire to sin, yet he is the light and life
				       of sinners. <reference osisRef="Rom.3.25">Romans 3:25</reference>f. "Whom God hath set forth to be a
				       propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his
				       righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
				       forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his
				       righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of him
				       which believeth in Jesus."
				</p><p>
				       So the immutable truth of God, in the threatenings of his law
				       against the sins of men, was never so manifested as it is in Jesus
				       Christ, for there never was any other so great a trial of the
				       unalterableness of the truth of God in those threatenings, as when
				       sin came to be imputed to his own Son. And then in Christ has been
				       seen already an actual complete accomplishment of those
				       threatenings, which never has been nor will be seen in any other
				       instance; because the eternity that will be taken up in fulfilling
				       those threatenings on others, never will be finished. Christ
				       manifested an infinite regard to this truth of God in his
				       sufferings. And, in his judging the world, he makes the covenant of
				       works, that contains those dreadful threatenings, his rule of
				       judgement. He will see to it, that it is not infringed in the least
				       jot or tittle: he will do nothing contrary to the threatenings of
				       the law, and their complete fulfilment. And yet in him we have many
				       great and precious promises, promises of perfect deliverance from
				       the penalty of the law. And this is the promise that he hath
				       promised us, even eternal life. And in him are all the promises of
				       God yea, and Amen.
				</p><p>
				       Part Two Having thus shown wherein there is an admirable
				       conjunction of excellencies in Jesus Christ, I now proceed,
				       Secondly, To show how this admirable conjunction of excellencies
				       appears in Christ's acts, [ namely:]
				</p><p>
				       A) in his taking of human nature,
				</p><p>
				       B) in his earthly life,
				</p><p>
				       C) in his sacrificial death,
				</p><p>
				       D) in his exaltation in heaven,
				</p><p>
				       E) in his final subduing of all evil when he returns in glory.]
				</p><p>
				       A) It appears in what Christ did in taking on him our nature.
				       In this act, his infinite condescension wonderfully appeared, That
				       he who was God should become man; that the word should be made
				       flesh, and should take on him a nature infinitely below his
				       original nature! And it appears yet more remarkably in the low
				       circumstances of his incarnation: he was conceived in the womb of a
				       poor young woman, whose poverty appeared in this, when she came to
				       offer sacrifices of her purification, she brought what was allowed
				       of in the law only in case of poverty, as <reference osisRef="Luke.2.24">Luke 2:24</reference>. "According to
				       what Is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two
				       young pigeons." This was allowed only in case the person was so
				       poor that she was not able to offer a lamb. <reference osisRef="Lev.12.8">Leviticus 12:8</reference>.
				       And though his infinite condescension thus appeared in the manner
				       of his incarnation, yet his divine dignity also appeared in it; for
				       though he was conceived in the womb of a poor virgin, yet he was
				       conceived there by the power of the Holy Ghost. And his divine
				       dignity also appeared in the holiness of his conception and birth.
				       Though he was conceived in the womb of one of the corrupt race of
				       mankind, yet he was conceived and born without sin; as the angel
				       said to the blessed Virgin, <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference>. "The Holy Ghost shall come
				       upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee,
				       therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall
				       be called the Son of God."
				</p><p>
				       His infinite condescension marvelously appeared in the manner of
				       his birth. He was brought forth in a stable because there was no
				       room for them in the inn. The inn was taken up by others, that were
				       looked upon as persons of greater account. The Blessed Virgin,
				       being poor and despised, was turned or shut out. Though she was in
				       such necessitous circumstances, yet those that counted themselves
				       her betters would not give place to her; and therefore, in the time
				       of her travail, she was forced to betake herself to a stable; and
				       when the child was born, it was wrapped in swaddling clothes, and
				       laid in a manger. There Christ lay a little infant, and there he
				       eminently appeared as a lamb.
				</p><p>
				       But yet this feeble infant, born thus in a stable, and laid in a
				       manger, was born to conquer and triumph over Satan, that roaring
				       lion. He came to subdue the mighty powers of darkness, and make a
				       show of them openly, and so to restore peace on earth, and to
				       manifest God's good-will towards men, and to bring glory to God in
				       the highest, according as the end of his birth was declared by the
				       joyful songs of the glorious hosts of angels appearing to the
				       shepherds at the same time that the infant lay in the manger;
				       whereby his divine dignity was manifested.
				</p><p>
				       B) This admirable conjunction of excellencies appears in the acts
				       and various passages of Christ's life.
				</p><p>
				       Though Christ dwelt in mean outward circumstances, whereby his
				       condescension and humility especially appeared, and his majesty was
				       veiled; yet his divine divinity and glory did in many of his acts
				       shine through the veil, and it illustriously appeared, that he was
				       not only the Son of man, but the great God.
				</p><p>
				       Thus, in the circumstances of his infancy, his outward meanness
				       appeared; yet there was something then to show forth his divine
				       dignity, in the wise men's being stirred up to come from the east
				       to give honor to him their being led by a miraculous star, and
				       coming and falling down and worshipping him, and presenting him
				       with gold, frankincense, and myrrh. His humility and meekness
				       wonderfully appeared in his subjection to his mother and reputed
				       father when he was a child. Herein he appeared as a lamb. But his
				       divine glory broke forth and shone when, at twelve years old, he
				       disputed with doctors in the temple. In that he appeared, in some
				       measure, as the Lion of the tribe of Judah.
				</p><p>
				       And so, after he entered on his public ministry, his marvellous
				       humility and meekness was manifested in his choosing to appear in
				       such mean outward circumstances; and in being contented in them,
				       when he was so poor that he had not where to lay his head, and
				       depended on the charity of some of his followers for his
				       subsistence, as appears by Luke 8. at the beginning. How meek,
				       condescending, and familiar his treatment of his disciples; his
				       discourses with them, treating them as a father his children, yea,
				       as friends and companions. How patient, bearing such affliction and
				       reproach, and so many injuries from the scribes and Pharisees, and
				       others. In these things he appeared as a Lamb.
				</p><p>
				       And yet he at the same time did in many ways show forth his divine
				       majesty and glory, particularly in the miracles he wrought, which
				       were evidently divine works, and manifested omnipotent power, and
				       so declared him to be the Lion of the tribe of Judah. His wonderful
				       and miraculous works plainly showed him to be the God of nature; in
				       that it appeared by them that he had all nature in his hands, and
				       could lay an arrest upon it, and stop and change its course as he
				       pleased. In healing the sick, and opening the eyes of the blind,
				       and unstopping the ears of the deaf, and healing the lame, he
				       showed that he was the God that framed the eye, and created the
				       ear, and was the author of the frame of man's body. By the dead's
				       rising at his command, it appeared that he was the author and
				       fountain of life, and that "God the Lord, to whom belong the issues
				       from death." By his walking on the sea in a storm, when the waves
				       were raised, he showed himself to be that God spoken of in <reference osisRef="Job.9.8">Job 9:8</reference>.
				       "That treadeth on the waves of the sea." By his stilling the storm,
				       and calming the rage of the sea, by his powerful command, saying,
				       "Peace, be still," he showed that he has the command of the
				       universe, and that he is that God who brings things to pass by the
				       word of his power, who speaks and it is done, who commands and it
				       stands fast; <reference osisRef="Ps.115.7">Psalms 115:7</reference>. "Who stilleth the noise of the seas, the
				       noise of their waves." And <reference osisRef="Ps.107.29">Psalms 107:29</reference>. "That maketh the storm a
				       calm, so that the waves thereof are still." And <reference osisRef="Ps.139.8">Psalms 139:8</reference>f. "O
				       Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee, or to thy
				       faithfulness round about thee? Thou rulest the raging of the sea:
				       when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them." Christ, by
				       casting out devils, remarkably appeared as the Lion of the tribe of
				       Judah, and showed that he was stronger than the roaring lion, that
				       seizes whom he may devour. He commanded them to come out, and they
				       were forced to obey. They were terribly afraid of him; they fall
				       down before him, and beseech him not so torment them. He forces a
				       whole legion of them to forsake their hold, by his powerful word;
				       and they could not so much as enter into the swine without his
				       leave. He showed the glory of his omniscience, by telling the
				       thoughts of men; as we have often an account. Herein he appeared to
				       be that God spoken of, <reference osisRef="Amos.4.13">Amos 4:13</reference>. "That declareth unto man what is
				       his thought." Thus, in the midst of his meanness and humiliation,
				       his divine glory appeared in his miracles, <reference osisRef="John.2.11">John 2:11</reference>. "This
				       beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested
				       forth his glory."
				</p><p>
				       And though Christ ordinarily appeared without outward glory, and in
				       great obscurity, yet at a certain time he threw off the veil, and
				       appeared in his divine majesty, so far as it could be outwardly
				       manifested to men in this frail state, when he was transfigured in
				       the mount. The apostle Peter, <reference osisRef="2Pet.1.16 2Pet.1.17">2 Peter 1:16-17</reference>. was an "eye-witness
				       of his majesty, when he received from God the Father honor and
				       glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent
				       glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; which
				       voice that came from heaven they heard, when they were with him in
				       the holy mount."
				</p><p>
				       And at the same time that Christ was wont to appear in such
				       meekness, condescension, and humility, in his familiar discourses
				       with his disciples, appearing therein as the Lamb of God; he was
				       also wont to appear as The Lion of the tribe of Judah, with divine
				       authority and majesty, in his so sharply rebuking the scribes and
				       Pharisees, and other hypocrites.
				</p><p>
				       C) This admirable conjunction of excellencies remarkably appears in
				       his offering up himself a sacrifice for sinners in his last
				       sufferings.
				</p><p>
				       As this was the greatest thing in all the works of redemption, the
				       greatest act of Christ in that work; so in this act especially does
				       there appear that admirable conjunction of excellencies that has
				       been spoken of. Christ never so much appeared as a lamb, as when he
				       was slain: "He came like a lamb to the slaughter," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.7">Isaiah 53:7</reference>.
				       Then he was offered up to God as a lamb without blemish, and
				       without spot: then especially did he appear to be the anti-type of
				       the lamb of the passover: <reference osisRef="1Cor.5.7">1 Corinthians 5:7</reference>. "Christ our Passover
				       sacrificed for us." And yet in that act he did in an especial
				       manner appear as the Lion of the tribe of Judah; yea, in this above
				       all other acts, in many respects, as may appear in the following
				       things.
				</p><p>
				         1. Then was Christ in the greatest degree of his humiliation, and
				            yet by that, above all other things, his divine glory appears.
				            Christ's humiliation was great, in being born in such a low
				            condition, of a poor virgin, and in a stable. His humiliation
				            was great, in being subject to Joseph the carpenter, and Mary
				            his mother, and afterwards living in poverty, so as not to
				            have where to lay his head; and in suffering such manifold and
				            bitter reproaches as he suffered, while he went about
				            preaching and working miracles. But his humiliation was never
				            so great as it was, in his last sufferings, beginning with his
				            agony in the garden, till he expired on the cross. Never was
				            he subject to such ignominy as then, never did he suffer so
				            much pain in his body, or so much sorrow in his soul; never
				            was he in so great an exercise of his condescension, humility,
				            meekness, and patience, as he was in these last sufferings;
				            never was his divine glory and majesty covered with so thick
				            and dark a veil; never did he so empty himself and make
				            himself of no reputation, as at this time.
				</p><p>
				            And yet, never was his divine glory so manifested, by any act
				            of his, as in yielding himself up to these sufferings. When
				            the fruit of it came to appear, and the mystery and ends of it
				            to be unfolded in its issue, then did the glory of it appear,
				            then did it appear as the most glorious act of Christ that
				            ever he exercised towards the creature. This act of his is
				            celebrated by the angels and hosts of heaven with peculiar
				            praises, as that which is above all others glorious, as you
				            may see in the context, (<reference osisRef="Rev.5.9 Rev.5.10 Rev.5.11 Rev.5.12">Revelation of John 5:9-12</reference>) "And they sang a
				            new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to
				            open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain and hast redeemed
				            us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and
				            people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and
				            priests: and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld, and I
				            heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the
				            beasts, and the elders: and the number of them was ten
				            thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,
				            saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to
				            receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
				            honor, and glory, and blessing."
				</p><p>
				         2. He never in any act gave so great a manifestation of love to
				            God, and yet never so manifested his love to those that were
				            enemies to God, as in that act.
				</p><p>
				            Christ never did any thing whereby his love to the Father was
				            so eminently manifested, as in his laying down his life, under
				            such inexpressible sufferings, in obedience to his command and
				            for the vindication of the honor of his authority and majesty;
				            nor did ever any mere creature give such a testimony of love
				            to God as that was.
				</p><p>
				            And yet this was the greatest expression of his love to sinful
				            men who were enemies to God; <reference osisRef="Rom.5.10">Romans 5:10</reference>. "When we were enemies,
				            we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son." The
				            greatness of Christ's love to such, appears in nothing so much
				            as in its being dying love. That blood of Christ which fell in
				            great drops to the ground, in his agony, was shed from love to
				            God's enemies, and his own. That shame and spitting, that
				            torment of body, and that exceeding sorrow, even unto death,
				            which he endured in his soul, was what he underwent from love
				            to rebels against God to save them from hell, and to purchase
				            for them eternal glory. Never did Christ so eminently show his
				            regard to God's honor, as in offering up himself a victim to
				            Justice. And yet in this above all, he manifested his love to
				            them who dishonored God, so as to bring such guilt on
				            themselves, that nothing less than his blood could atone for
				            it.
				</p><p>
				         3. Christ never so eminently appeared for divine justice, and yet
				            never suffered so much from divine Justice, as when he offered
				            up himself a sacrifice for our sins.
				</p><p>
				            In Christ's great sufferings did his infinite regard to the
				            honor of God's justice distinguishingly appear, for it was
				            from regard to that that he thus humbled himself.
				            And yet in these sufferings, Christ was the target of the
				            vindictive expressions of that very justice of God. Revenging
				            justice then spent all its force upon him, on account of our
				            guilt; which made him sweat blood, and cry out upon the cross,
				            and probably rent his vitals-broke his heart, the fountain of
				            blood, or some other blood vessels-and by the violent
				            fermentation turned his blood to water. For the blood and
				            water that issued out of his side, when pierced by the spear,
				            seems to have been extravasated blood, and so there might be a
				            kind of literal fulfilment of <reference osisRef="Ps.22.14">Psalms 22:14</reference>. "I am poured out
				            like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is
				            like wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels." And this
				            was the way and means by which Christ stood up for the honor
				            of God's justice, namely, by thus suffering its terrible
				            executions. For when he had undertaken for sinners, and had
				            substituted himself in their room, divine justice could have
				            its due honor no other way than by his suffering its revenges.
				            In this the diverse excellencies that met in the person of
				            Christ appeared, namely, his infinite regard to God's justice,
				            and such love to those that have exposed themselves to it, as
				            induced him thus to yield himself a sacrifice to it.
				</p><p>
				         4. Christ's holiness never so illustriously shone forth as it did
				            in his last sufferings, and yet he never was to such a degree
				            treated as guilty.
				</p><p>
				            Christ's holiness never had such a trial as it had then, and
				            therefore never had so great a manifestation. When it was
				            tried in this furnace it came forth as gold, or as silver
				            purified seven times. His holiness then above all appeared in
				            his steadfast pursuit of the honor of God, and in his
				            obedience to him. For his yielding himself unto death was
				            transcendently the greatest act of obedience that ever was
				            paid to God by any one since the foundation of the world.
				            And yet then Christ was in the greatest degree treated as a
				            wicked person would have been. He was apprehended and bound as
				            a malefactor. His accusers represented him as a most wicked
				            wretch. In his sufferings before his crucifixion, he was
				            treated as if he had been the worst and vilest of mankind, and
				            then, he was put to a kind of death, that none but the worst
				            sort of malefactors were wont to suffer, those that were most
				            abject in their persons, and guilty of the blackest crimes.
				            And he suffered as though guilty from God himself, by reason
				            of our guilt imputed to him; for he who knew no sin, was made
				            sin for us; he was made subject to wrath, as if he had been
				            sinful himself. He was made a curse for us.
				            Christ never so greatly manifested his hatred of sin, as
				            against God, as in his dying to take away the dishonor that
				            sin had done to God; and yet never was he to such a degree
				            subject to the terrible effects of God's hatred of sin, and
				            wrath against it, as he was then. in this appears those
				            diverse excellencies meeting in Christ, namely, love to God,
				            and grace to sinners.
				</p><p>
				         5. He never was so dealt with, as unworthy, as in his last
				            sufferings, and yet it is chiefly on account of them that he
				            is accounted worthy.
				</p><p>
				            He was therein dealt with as if he had not been worthy to
				            live: they cry out, "Away with him! away with him! Crucify
				            him." <reference osisRef="John.19.15">John 19:15</reference>. And they prefer Barabbas before him. And he
				            suffered from the Father, as one whose demerits were infinite,
				            by reason of our demerits that were laid upon him.
				</p><p>
				            And yet it was especially by that act of his subjecting
				            himself to those sufferings that he merited, and on the
				            account of which chiefly he was accounted worthy of the glory
				            of his exaltation. <reference osisRef="Phil.2.8 Phil.2.9">Philippians 2:8-9</reference>. "He humbled himself, and
				            became obedient unto death; wherefore God hath highly exalted
				            him." And we see that it is on this account chiefly, that he
				            is extolled as worthy by saints and angels in the context:
				            "Worthy," say they, "is the Lamb that was slain." This shows
				            an admirable conjunction in him of infinite dignity, and
				            infinite condescension and love to the infinitely unworthy.
				</p><p>
				         6. Christ in his last sufferings suffered most extremely from
				            those towards whom he was then manifesting his greatest act of
				            love.
				</p><p>
				            He never suffered so much from his Father, (though not from
				            any hatred to him, but from hatred to our sins,) for he then
				            forsook him, or took away the comforts of his presence; and
				            then "it pleased the Lord to bruise him, and put him to
				            grief." as <reference osisRef="Isa.53.10">Isaiah 53:10</reference>. And yet he never gave so great a
				            manifestation of love to God as then, as has been already
				            observed.
				</p><p>
				            So Christ never suffered so much from the hands of men as he
				            did then; and yet never was in so high an exercise of love to
				            men. He never was so ill treated by his disciples; who were so
				            unconcerned about his sufferings, that they .would not watch
				            with him one hour, in his agony; and when he was apprehended,
				            all forsook him and fled, except Peter, who denied him with
				            oaths and curses. And yet then he was suffering, shedding his
				            blood, and pouring out his soul unto death for them. Yea, he
				            probably was then shedding his blood for some of them that
				            shed his blood, for whom he prayed while they were crucifying
				            him; and who were probably afterwards brought home to Christ
				            by Peter's preaching. (Compare <reference osisRef="Luke.23.34">Luke 23:34</reference>. <reference osisRef="Acts.2.23 Acts.2.36 Acts.2.37 Acts.2.41">Acts 2:23, 36-37, 41</reference>.
				            and chap. 3:17. and chap. 4.) This shows an admirable meeting
				            of justice and grace in the redemption of Christ.
				</p><p>
				         7. It was in Christ's last sufferings, above all, that he was
				            delivered up to the power of his enemies; and yet by these,
				            above all, he obtained victory over his enemies.
				</p><p>
				            Christ never was so in his enemies' hands, as in the time of
				            his last sufferings. They sought his life before; but from
				            time to time they were restrained, and Christ escaped out of
				            their hands, and this reason is given for it, that his time
				            was not yet come. But now they were suffered to work their
				            will upon him, he was in a great degree delivered up to the
				            malice and cruelty of both wicked men and devils. And
				            therefore when Christ's enemies came to apprehend him, he says
				            to them, <reference osisRef="Luke.22.53">Luke 22:53</reference>. "When I was daily with you in the temple
				            ye stretched forth no hand against me: but this is your hour,
				            and the power of darkness."
				</p><p>
				            And yet it was principally by means of those sufferings that
				            he conquered and overthrew his enemies. Christ never so
				            effectually bruised Satan's head, as when Satan bruised his
				            heel. The weapon with which Christ warred against the devil,
				            and obtained a most complete victory and glorious triumph over
				            him, was the cross, the instrument and weapon with which he
				            thought he had overthrown Christ, and brought on him shameful
				            destruction. <reference osisRef="Col.2.14 Col.2.15">Colossians 2:14-15</reference>. "Blotting out the handwriting of
				            ordinances,-nailing it to his cross: and having spoiled
				            principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly,
				            triumphing over them in it." In his last sufferings, Christ
				            sapped the very foundations of Satan's kingdom, he conquered
				            his enemies in their own territories, and beat them with their
				            own weapons as David cut off Goliath's head with his own
				            sword. The devil had, as it were, swallowed up Christ, as the
				            whale did Jonah- but it was deadly poison to him, he gave him
				            a mortal wound in his own bowels. He was soon sick of his
				            morsel, and was forced to do by him as the whale did by Jonah.
				            To this day he is heart-sick of what he then swallowed as his
				            prey. In those sufferings of Christ was laid the foundation of
				            all that glorious victory he has already obtained over Satan,
				            in the overthrow of his heathenish kingdom in the Roman
				            empire, and all the success the gospel has had since; and also
				            of all his future and still more glorious victory that is to
				            be obtained in the earth. Thus Samson's riddle is most
				            eminently fulfilled, <reference osisRef="Judg.14.14">Judges 14:14</reference>. "Out of the eater came
				            forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness." And
				            thus the true Samson does more towards the destruction of his
				            enemies at his death than in his life, in yielding up himself
				            to death, he pulls down the temple of Dagon, and destroys many
				            thousands of his enemies, even while they are making
				            themselves sport in his sufferings-and so he whose type was
				            the ark, pulls down Dagon, and breaks off his head and hands
				            in his own temple, even while he is brought in there as
				            Dagon's captive. (<reference osisRef="1Sam.5.1 1Sam.5.2 1Sam.5.3 1Sam.5.4">1 Samuel 5:1-4</reference>)
				</p><p>
				            Thus Christ appeared at the same time, and in the same act, as
				            both a lion and a lamb. He appeared as a lamb in the hands of
				            his cruel enemies; as a lamb in the paws, and between the
				            devouring jaws, of a roaring lion; yea, he was a lamb actually
				            slain by this lion: and yet at the same time, as the Lion of
				            the tribe of Judah, he conquers and triumphs over Satan;
				            destroying his own destroyer; as Samson did the lion that
				            roared upon him, when he rent him as he would a kid. And in
				            nothing has Christ appeared so much as a lion, in glorious
				            strength destroying his enemies, as when he was brought as a
				            lamb to the slaughter. In his greatest weakness he was most
				            strong; and when he suffered most from his enemies, he brought
				            the greatest confusion on his enemies.
				</p><p>
				            Thus this admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies was
				            manifest in Christ, in his offering up himself to God in his
				            last sufferings.
				</p><p>
				            D) It is still manifest in his acts, in his present state of
				            exaltation in heaven. Indeed, in his exalted state, he most
				            eminently appears in manifestation of those excellencies, on
				            the account of which he is compared to a lion; but still he
				            appears as a lamb; <reference osisRef="Rev.14.1">Revelation of John 14:1</reference>. "And I looked, and lo, a Lamb
				            stood on mount Sion"; as in his state of humiliation he
				            chiefly appeared as a lamb, and yet did not appear without
				            manifestation of his divine majesty and power, as the Lion of
				            the tribe of Judah. Though Christ be now at the right-hand of
				            God, exalted as King of heaven, and Lord of the universe; yet
				            as he still is in the human nature, he still excels in
				            humility. Though the man Christ Jesus be the highest of all
				            creatures in heaven, yet he as much excels them all in
				            humility as he doth in glory and dignity, for none sees so
				            much of the distance between God and him as he does. And
				            though he now appears in such glorious majesty and dominion in
				            heaven, yet he appears as a lamb in his condescending, mild,
				            and sweet treatment of his saints there, for he is a Lamb
				            still, even amidst the throne of his exaltation, and he that
				            is the Shepherd of the whole flock is himself a Lamb, and goes
				            before them in heaven as such. <reference osisRef="Rev.7.17">Revelation of John 7:17</reference>. "For the Lamb, which
				            is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead
				            them unto living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away
				            all tears from their eyes." Though in heaven every knee bows
				            to him, and though the angels fall down before him adoring
				            him, yet he treats his saints with infinite condescension,
				            mildness, and endearment. And in his acts towards the saints
				            on earth, he still appears as a lamb, manifesting exceeding
				            love and tenderness in his intercession for them, as one that
				            has had experience of affliction and temptation. He has not
				            forgot what these things are, nor has he forgot how to pity
				            those that are subject to them. And he still manifests his
				            lamb-like excellencies, in his dealings with his saints on
				            earth, in admirable forbearance, love, gentleness, and
				            compassion. Behold him instructing, supplying, supporting, and
				            comforting them; often coming to them, and manifesting himself
				            to them by his Spirit, that he may sup with them, and they
				            with him. Behold him admitting them to sweet communion,
				            enabling them with boldness and confidence to come to him, and
				            solacing their hearts. And in heaven Christ still appears, as
				            it were, with the marks of his wounds upon him, and so appears
				            as a Lamb as it had been slain, as he was represented in
				            vision to St John, in the text, when he appeared to open the
				            book sealed with seven seals, which is part of the glory of
				            his exaltation.
				</p><p>
				            E) And lastly, this admirable conjunction of excellencies will
				            be manifest in Christ's acts at the last judgement.
				</p><p>
				            He then, above all other times, will appear as the Lion of the
				            tribe of Judah in infinite greatness and majesty, when he
				            shall come in the glory of his Father, with all the holy
				            angels, and the earth shall tremble before him, and the hills
				            shall melt. This is he (<reference osisRef="Rev.20.11">Revelation of John 20:11</reference>.) "that shall sit on a
				            great white throne, before whose face the earth and heaven
				            shall flee away." He will then appear in the most dreadful and
				            amazing manner to the wicked. The devils tremble at the
				            thought of that appearance, and when it shall be, the kings,
				            and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains.
				            and the mighty men, and every bond-man and every free-man,
				            shall hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the
				            mountains, and shall cry to the mountains and rocks to fall on
				            them, to hide them from the face and wrath of the Lamb. And
				            none can declare or conceive of the amazing manifestations of
				            wrath in which he will then appear towards these, or the
				            trembling and astonishment the shrieking and gnashing of
				            teeth, with which they shall stand before his judgment-seat,
				            and receive the terrible sentence of his wrath.
				</p><p>
				            And yet he will at the same time appear as a Lamb to his
				            saints; he will receive them as friends and brethren, treating
				            them with infinite mildness and love. There shall be nothing
				            in him terrible to them, but towards them he will clothe
				            himself wholly with sweetness and endearment. The church shall
				            be then admitted to him as his bride; that shall be her
				            wedding-day. The saints shall all be sweetly invited to come
				            with him to inherit the kingdom, and reign in it with him to
				            all eternity.
				</p><p>
				            Part Three [I would now show how the aforesaid teaching is of
				            benefit to us, in that
				</p><p>
				            A) it gives us insight into the names of Christ in Scripture,
				</p><p>
				            B) it encourages us to accept him as our Savior,
				</p><p>
				            C) it encourages us to accept him as our Friend.]
				</p><p>
				            A) From this doctrine we may learn one reason why Christ is
				            called by such a variety of names, and held forth under such a
				            variety of representations, in Scripture. It is the better to
				            signify and exhibit to us that variety of excellencies that
				            meet together and are conjoined in him. Many appellations are
				            mentioned together in one verse <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>. "For unto us a
				            Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government
				            shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
				            Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father,
				            the Prince of Peace." It shows a wonderful conjunction of
				            excellencies, that the same person should be a Son, born and
				            given, and yet be the everlasting Father, without beginning or
				            end, that he should be a Child, and yet be he whose name is
				            Counsellor, and the mighty God; and well may his name, in whom
				            such things are conjoined, be called wonderful.
				</p><p>
				            By reason of the same wonderful conjunction, Christ is
				            represented by a great variety of sensible things, that are on
				            some account excellent. Thus in some places he is called a
				            Sun, as <reference osisRef="Mal.4.2">Malachi 4:2</reference>, in others a Star, <reference osisRef="Num.24.17">Numbers 24:17</reference>. And he is
				            especially represented by the Morning star, as being that
				            which excels all other stars in brightness, and is the
				            forerunner of the day, <reference osisRef="Rev.22.16">Revelation of John 22:16</reference>. And, as in our text, he is
				            compared to a lion in one verse, and a lamb in the next, so
				            sometimes he is compared to a roe or young hart, another
				            creature most diverse from a lion. So in some places he is
				            called a rock, in others he is compared to a pearl. In some
				            places he is called a man of war, and the Captain of our
				            Salvation, in other places he is represented as a bridegroom.
				            In the second chapter of Canticles, the first verse, he is
				            compared to a rose and a lily, that are sweet and beautiful
				            flowers; in the next verse but one, he is compared to a tree
				            bearing sweet fruit. In <reference osisRef="Isa.53.2">Isaiah 53:2</reference> he is called a Root out of
				            a dry ground; but elsewhere, instead of that, he is called the
				            Tree of Life, that grows (not in a dry or barren ground, but)
				            "in the midst of the paradise of God." <reference osisRef="Rev.2.7">Revelation of John 2:7</reference>.
				</p><p>
				            B) Let the consideration of this wonderful meeting of diverse
				            excellencies in Christ induce you to accept of him, and close
				            with him as your Savior. As all manner of excellencies meet in
				            him, so there are concurring in him all manner of arguments
				            and motives, to move you to choose him for your Savior, and
				            every thing that tends to encourage poor sinners to come and
				            put their trust in him: his fullness and all-sufficiency as a
				            Savior gloriously appear in that variety of excellencies that
				            has been spoken of.
				</p><p>
				            Fallen man is in a state of exceeding great misery, and is
				            helpless in it; he is a poor weak creature, like an infant
				            cast out in its blood in the day that it is born. But Christ
				            is the lion of the tribe of Judah; he is strong, though we are
				            weak; he hath prevailed to do that for us which no creature
				            else could do. Fallen man is a mean despicable creature, a
				            contemptible worm; but Christ, who has undertaken for us, is
				            infinitely honorable and worthy. Fallen man is polluted, but
				            Christ is infinitely holy; fallen man is hateful, but Christ
				            is infinitely lovely; fallen man is the object of God's
				            indignation, but Christ is infinitely dear to him. We have
				            dreadfully provoked God, but Christ has performed that
				            righteousness which is infinitely precious in God's eyes.
				            And here is not only infinite strength and infinite
				            worthiness, but infinite condescension, and love and mercy, as
				            great as power and dignity. If you are a poor, distressed
				            sinner, whose heart is ready to sink for fear that God never
				            will have mercy on you, you need not be afraid to go to
				            Christ, for fear that he is either unable or unwilling to help
				            you. Here is a strong foundation, and an inexhaustible
				            treasure, to answer the necessities of your poor soul, and
				            here is infinite grace and gentleness to invite and embolden a
				            poor, unworthy, fearful soul to come to it. If Christ accepts
				            of you, you need not fear but that you will be safe, for he is
				            a strong Lion for your defense. And if you come, you need not
				            fear but that you shall be accepted; for he is like a Lamb to
				            all that come to him, and receives then with infinite grace
				            and tenderness. It is true he has awful majesty, he is the
				            great God, and infinitely high above you; but there is this to
				            encourage and embolden the poor sinner, that Christ is man as
				            well as God; he is a creature, as well as the Creator, and he
				            is the most humble and lowly in heart of any creature in
				            heaven or earth. This may well make the poor unworthy creature
				            bold in coming to him. You need not hesitate one moment; but
				            may run to him, and cast yourself upon him. You will certainly
				            be graciously and meekly received by him. Though he is a lion,
				            he will only be a lion to your enemies, but he will be a lamb
				            to you. It could not have been conceived, had it not been so
				            in the person of Christ, that there could have been so much in
				            any Savior, that is inviting and tending to encourage sinners
				            to trust in him. Whatever your circumstances are, you need not
				            be afraid to come to such a Savior as this. Be you never so
				            wicked a creature, here is worthiness enough; be you never so
				            poor, and mean, and ignorant a creature, there is no danger of
				            being despised, for though he be so much greater than you, he
				            is also immensely more humble than you. Any one of you that is
				            a father or mother, will not despise one of your own children
				            that comes to you in distress: much less danger is there of
				            Christ's despising you, if you in your heart come to him.
				            Here let me a little expostulate with the poor, burdened,
				            distressed soul.
				</p><p>
				              1. What are you afraid of, that you dare not venture your
				                 soul upon Christ? Are you afraid that he cannot save you,
				                 that he is not strong enough to conquer the enemies of
				                 your soul? But how can you desire one stronger than "the
				                 almighty God"? as Christ is called, <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>. Is there
				                 need of greater than infinite strength? Are you afraid
				                 that he will not be willing to stoop so low as to take
				                 any gracious notice of you? But then, look on him, as he
				                 stood in the ring of soldiers, exposing his blessed face
				                 to be buffeted and spit upon by them! Behold him bound
				                 with his back uncovered to those that smote him! And
				                 behold him hanging on the cross! Do you think that he
				                 that had condescension enough to stoop to these things,
				                 and that for his crucifiers, will be unwilling to accept
				                 of you, if you come to him? Or, are you afraid that if he
				                 does accept you, that God the Father will not accept of
				                 him for you? But consider, will God reject his own Son,
				                 in whom his infinite delight is, and has been, from all
				                 eternity, and who is so united to him, that if he should
				                 reject him he would reject himself?
				</p><p>
				              2. What is there that you can desire should be in a Savior,
				                 that is not in Christ? Or, wherein should you desire a
				                 Savior should be otherwise than Christ is? What
				                 excellency is there wanting? What is there that is great
				                 or good; what is there that is venerable or winning; what
				                 is there that is adorable or endearing; or, what can you
				                 think of that would be encouraging, which is not to be
				                 found in the person of Christ? Would you have your Savior
				                 to be great and honorable, because you are not willing to
				                 be beholden to a mean person? And, is not Christ a person
				                 honorable enough to be worthy that you should be
				                 dependent on him? Is he not a person high enough to be
				                 appointed to so honorable a work as your salvation? Would
				                 you not only have a Savior of high degree, but would you
				                 have him, notwithstanding his exaltation and dignity, to
				                 be made also of low degree, that he might have experience
				                 of afflictions and trials, that he might learn by the
				                 things that he has suffered, to pity them that suffer and
				                 are tempted? And has not Christ been made low enough for
				                 you? and has he not suffered enough? Would you not only
				                 have him possess experience of the afflictions you now
				                 suffer, but also of that amazing wrath that you fear
				                 hereafter, that he may know how to pity those that are in
				                 danger, and afraid of it? This Christ has had experience
				                 of, which experience gave him a greater sense of it, a
				                 thousand times, than you have, or any man living has.
				                 Would you have your Savior to be one who is near to God,
				                 that so his mediation might be prevalent with him? And
				                 can you desire him to be nearer to God than Christ is,
				                 who is his only-begotten Son, of the same essence with
				                 the Father? And would you not only have him near to God,
				                 but also near to you, that you may have free access to
				                 him? And would you have him nearer to you than to be in
				                 the same nature, united to you by a spiritual union, so
				                 close as to be fitly represented by the union of the wife
				                 to the husband, of the branch to the vine, of the member
				                 to the head; yea, so as to be one spirit? For so he will
				                 be united to you, if you accept of him. Would you have a
				                 Savior that has given some great and extraordinary
				                 testimony of mercy and love to sinners, by something that
				                 he has done, as well as by what he says? And can you
				                 think or conceive of greater things than Christ has done?
				                 Was it not a great thing for him, who was God, to take
				                 upon him human nature: to be not only God, but man
				                 thenceforward to all eternity? But would you look upon
				                 suffering for sinners to be a yet greater testimony of
				                 love to sinners, than merely doing, though it be ever so
				                 extraordinary a thing that he has done? And would you
				                 desire that a Savior should suffer more than Christ has
				                 suffered for sinners? What is there wanting, or what
				                 would you add if you could, to make him more fit to be
				                 your Savior?
				</p><p>
				            But further, to induce you to accept of Christ as your Savior,
				            consider two things particularly.
				</p><p>
				              1. How much Christ appears as the Lamb of God in his
				                 invitations to you to come to him and trust in him. With
				                 what sweet grace and kindness does he, from time to time,
				                 call and invite you, as <reference osisRef="Prov.8.4">Proverbs 8:4</reference>. "Unto you, O men, I
				                 call, and my voice is to the sons of men." And <reference osisRef="Isa.55.1 Isa.55.2 Isa.55.3">Isaiah 55:1-3</reference> "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
				                 waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat-
				                 yea come, buy wine and milk without money, and without
				                 price." How gracious is he here in inviting every one
				                 that thirsts, and in so repeating his invitation over and
				                 over, "Come ye to the waters, come, buy and eat - - yea
				                 come!" Mark the excellency of that entertainment which he
				                 invites you to accept of; "Come, buy wine and milk!" your
				                 poverty, having nothing to pay for it, shall be no
				                 objection, "Come, he that hath no money, come without
				                 money, and without price!" What gracious arguments and
				                 expostulations he uses with you! "Wherefore do ye spend
				                 money for that which is not bread? and your labor for
				                 that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me,
				                 and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight
				                 itself in fatness." As much as to say, It is altogether
				                 needless for you to continue laboring and toiling for
				                 that which can never serve your turn, seeking rest in the
				                 world, and in your own righteousness - I have made
				                 abundant provision for you, of that which is really good,
				                 and will fully satisfy your desires, and answer your end,
				                 and I stand ready to accept of you: you need not be
				                 afraid; If you will come to me, I will engage to see all
				                 your wants supplied, and you made a happy creature. As he
				                 promises in the third verse, "Incline your ear, and come
				                 unto me: Hear, and your soul shall live, and I will make
				                 an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies
				                 of David." And so Prov. 9 at the beginning. How gracious
				                 and sweet is the invitation there! "Whoso is simple, let
				                 him turn in hither;" let you be never so poor, ignorant,
				                 and blind a creature, you shall be welcome. And in the
				                 following words Christ sets forth the provision that he
				                 has made for you, "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of
				                 the wine which I have mingled." You are in a poor
				                 famishing state, and have nothing wherewith to feed your
				                 perishing soul; you have been seeking something, but yet
				                 remain destitute. Hearken, how Christ calls you to eat of
				                 his bread, and to drink of the wine that he hath mingled!
				                 And how much like a lamb does Christ appear in <reference osisRef="Matt.9.28">Matthew 9:28</reference>
				                 30. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
				                 and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and
				                 learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
				                 shall find rest to your souls. For my yoke is easy, and
				                 my burden is light." O thou poor distressed soul! whoever
				                 thou art, consider that Christ mentions thy very case
				                 when he calls to them who labor and are heavy laden! How
				                 he repeatedly promises you rest if you come to him! In
				                 the 28th verse he says, "I will give you rest." And in
				                 the 29th verse, "Ye shall find rest to your souls." This
				                 is what you want. This is the thing you have been so long
				                 in vain seeking after. O how sweet would rest be to you,
				                 if you could but obtain it! Come to Christ, and you shall
				                 obtain it. And hear how Christ, to encourage you,
				                 represents himself as a lamb! He tells you, that he is
				                 meek and lowly in heart, and are you afraid to come to
				                 such a one! And again, <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference>. "Behold, I stand at the
				                 door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the
				                 door, I will come in to him, and I will sup with him and
				                 he with me." Christ condescends not only to call you to
				                 him, but he comes to you; he comes to your door, and
				                 there knocks. He might send an officer and seize you as a
				                 rebel and vile malefactor, but instead of that, he comes
				                 and knocks at your door, and seeks that you would receive
				                 him into your house, as your Friend and Savior. And he
				                 not only knocks at your door, but he stands there
				                 waiting, while you are backward and unwilling. And not
				                 only so, but he makes promises what he will do for you,
				                 if you will admit him, what privileges he will admit you
				                 to; he will sup with you, and you with him. And again,
				                 <reference osisRef="Rev.22.16 Rev.22.17">Revelation of John 22:16-17</reference>. "I am the root and the offspring of David,
				                 and the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the
				                 bride say, Come. And let him that heareth, say, Come. And
				                 let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will let him
				                 take of the water of life freely." How does Christ here
				                 graciously set before you his own winning attractive
				                 excellency! And how does he condescend to declare to you
				                 not only his own invitation, but the invitation of the
				                 Spirit and the bride, if by any means he might encourage
				                 you to come! And how does he invite every one that will,
				                 that they may "take of the water of life freely," that
				                 they may take it as a free gift, however precious it be,
				                 and though it be the Water of life.
				</p><p>
				              2. If you do come to Christ, he will appear as a Lion, in
				                 his glorious power and dominion, to defend you. All those
				                 excellencies of his, in which he appears as a lion, shall
				                 be yours, and shall be employed for you in your defense,
				                 for your safety, and to promote your glory, he will be as
				                 a lion to fight against your enemies. He that touches
				                 you, or offends you, will provoke his wrath, as he that
				                 stirs up a lion. Unless your enemies can conquer this
				                 Lion, they shall not be able to destroy or hurt you;
				                 unless they are stronger than he, they shall not be able
				                 to hinder your happiness. <reference osisRef="Isa.31.4">Isaiah 31:4</reference>. "For thus hath the
				                 Lord spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion
				                 roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is
				                 called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their
				                 voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them; so shall
				                 the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and
				                 for the hill thereof."
				</p><p>
				            C) Let what has been said be improved to induce you to love
				            the Lord Jesus Christ, and choose him for your friend and
				            portion. As there is such an admirable meeting of diverse
				            excellencies in Christ, so there is every thing in him to
				            render him worthy of your love and choice, and to win and
				            engage it. Whatsoever there is or can be desirable in a
				            friend, is in Christ, and that to the highest degree that can
				            be desired.
				</p><p>
				            Would you choose for a friend a person of great dignity? It is
				            a thing taking with men to have those for their friends who
				            are much above them; because they look upon themselves honored
				            by the friendship of such. Thus, how taking would it be with
				            an inferior maid to be the object of the dear love of some
				            great and excellent prince. But Christ is infinitely above
				            you, and above all the princes of the earth; for he is the
				            King of kings. So honorable a person as this offers himself to
				            you, in the nearest and dearest friendship.
				</p><p>
				            And would you choose to have a friend not only great but good?
				            In Christ infinite greatness and infinite goodness meet
				            together, and receive lustre and glory one from another. His
				            greatness is rendered lovely by his goodness. The greater any
				            one is without goodness, so much the greater evil; but when
				            infinite goodness is joined with greatness, it renders it a
				            glorious and adorable greatness. So, on the other hand, his
				            infinite goodness receives lustre from his greatness. He that
				            is of great understanding and ability, and is withal of a good
				            and excellent disposition, is deservedly more esteemed than a
				            lower and lesser being with the same kind inclination and good
				            will. Indeed goodness is excellent in whatever subject it be
				            found; it is beauty and excellency itself, and renders all
				            excellent that are possessed of it; and yet most excellent
				            when joined with greatness. The very same excellent qualities
				            of gold render the body in which they are inherent more
				            precious, and of greater value, when joined with greater than
				            when with lesser dimensions. And how glorious is the sight, to
				            see him who is the great Creator and supreme Lord of heaven
				            and earth, full of condescension, tender pity and mercy,
				            towards the mean and unworthy! His almighty power, and
				            infinite majesty and self-sufficiency, render his exceeding
				            love and grace the more surprising And how do his
				            condescension and compassion endear his majesty, power, and
				            dominion, and render those attributes pleasant, that would
				            otherwise be only terrible! Would you not desire that your
				            friend, though great and honorable, should be of such
				            condescension and grace, and so to have the way opened to free
				            access to him, that his exaltation above you might not hinder
				            your free enjoyment of his friendship? - And would you choose
				            not only that the infinite greatness and majesty of your
				            friend should be, as it were, mollified and sweetened with
				            condescension and grace; but would you also desire to have
				            your friend brought nearer to you? Would you choose a friend
				            far above you, and yet as it were upon a level with you too?
				            Though it be taking with men to have a near and dear friend of
				            superior dignity, yet there is also an inclination in them to
				            have their friend a sharer with them in circumstances. Thus is
				            Christ. Though he be the great God, yet he has, as it were,
				            brought himself down to be upon a level with you, so as to
				            become man as you are that he might not only be your Lord, but
				            your brother, and that he might be the more fit to be a
				            companion for such a worm of the dust. This is one end of
				            Christ's taking upon him man's nature, that his people might
				            be under advantages for a more familiar converse with him than
				            the infinite distance of the divine nature would allow of. And
				            upon this account the church longed for Christ's incarnation,
				            <reference osisRef="Song.8.1">Song of Solomon 8:1</reference>. "O that thou wert my brother that sucked the breast
				            of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss
				            thee, yea, I should not be despised." One design of God in the
				            gospel is to bring us to make God the object of our undivided
				            respect, that he may engross our regard every way, that
				            whatever natural inclination there is in our souls, he may be
				            the centre of it; that God may be all in all. But there is an
				            inclination in the creature, not only to the adoration of a
				            Lord and Sovereign, but to complacence in some one as a
				            friend, to love and delight in some one that may be conversed
				            with as a companion. And virtue and holiness do not destroy or
				            weaken this inclination of our nature. But so hath God
				            contrived in the affair of our redemption, that a divine
				            person may be the object even of this inclination of our
				            nature. And in order hereto, such a one is come down to us,
				            and has taken our nature, and is become one of us, and calls
				            himself our friend, brother, and companion. <reference osisRef="Ps.122.8">Psalms 122:8</reference>. "For
				            my brethren and companions' sake, will I now say, Peace be
				            within thee."
				</p><p>
				            But is it not enough in order to invite and encourage you to
				            free access to a friend so great and high, that he is one of
				            infinite condescending grace, and also has taken your own
				            nature, and is become man? But would you, further to embolden
				            and win you, have him a man of wonderful meekness and
				            humility? Why, such a one is Christ! He is not only become man
				            for you, but far the meekest and most humble of all men, the
				            greatest instance of these sweet virtues that ever was, or
				            will be. And besides these, he has all other human
				            excellencies in the highest perfection. These, indeed, are no
				            proper addition to his divine excellencies. Christ has no more
				            excellency in his person, since his incarnation, than he had
				            before; for divine excellency is infinite, and cannot be added
				            to. Yet his human excellencies are additional manifestations
				            of his glory and excellency to us, and are additional
				            recommendations of him to our esteem and love, who are of
				            finite comprehension. Though his human excellencies are but
				            communications and reflections of his divine, and though this
				            light, as reflected, falls infinitely short of the divine
				            fountain of light in its immediate glory; yet the reflection
				            shines not without its proper advantages, as presented to our
				            view and affection. The glory of Christ in the qualifications
				            of his human nature, appears to us in excellencies that are of
				            our own kind, and are exercised in our own way and manner, and
				            so, in some respect, are peculiarly fitted to invite our
				            acquaintance and draw our affection. The glory of Christ as it
				            appears in his divinity, though far brighter, more dazzles our
				            eyes, and exceeds the strength of our sight or our
				            comprehension; but, as it shines in the human excellencies of
				            Christ, it is brought more to a level with our conceptions,
				            and suitableness to our nature and manner, yet retaining a
				            semblance of the same divine beauty, and a savor of the same
				            divine sweetness. But as both divine and human excellencies
				            meet together in Christ, they set off and recommend each other
				            to us. It tends to endear the divine majesty and holiness of
				            Christ to us, that these are attributes of one in our nature,
				            one of us, who is become our brother, and is the meekest and
				            humblest of men. It encourages us to look upon these divine
				            perfections, however high and great; since we have some near
				            concern in and liberty freely to enjoy them. And on the other
				            hand, how much more glorious and surprising do the meekness,
				            the humility, obedience, resignation, and other human
				            excellencies of Christ appear, when we consider that they are
				            in so great a person, as the eternal Son of God, the Lord of
				            heaven and earth!
				</p><p>
				            By your choosing Christ for your friend and portion, you will
				            obtain these two infinite benefits.
				</p><p>
				              1. Christ will give himself to you, with all those various
				                 excellencies that meet in him, to your full and
				                 everlasting enjoyment. He will ever after treat you as
				                 his dear friend; and you shall ere long be where he is,
				                 and shall behold his glory, and dwell with him, in most
				                 free and intimate communion and enjoyment.
				                 When the saints get to heaven, they shall not merely see
				                 Christ, and have to do with him as subjects and servants
				                 with a glorious and gracious Lord and Sovereign, but
				                 Christ will entertain them as friends and brethren. This
				                 we may learn from the manner of Christ's conversing with
				                 his disciples here on earth: though he was their
				                 Sovereign Lord, and did not refuse, but required, their
				                 supreme respect and adoration, yet he did not treat them
				                 as earthly sovereigns are wont to do their subjects. He
				                 did not keep them at an aweful distance, but all along
				                 conversed with them with the most friendly familiarity,
				                 as a father amongst a company of children, yea, as with
				                 brethren. So he did with the twelve, and so he did with
				                 Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. He told his disciples, that he
				                 did not call them servants, but friends, and we read of
				                 one of them that leaned on his bosom: and doubtless he
				                 will not treat his disciples with less freedom and
				                 endearment in heaven. He will not keep them at a greater
				                 distance for his being in a state of exaltation; but he
				                 will rather take them into a state of exaltation with
				                 him. This will be the improvement Christ will make of his
				                 own glory, to make his beloved friends partakers with
				                 him, to glorify them in his glory, as he says to his
				                 Father, <reference osisRef="John.17.22 John.17.23">John 17:22-23</reference>. "And the glory which thou hast
				                 given me, have I given them, that they may be one, even
				                 as we are one I in them" etc. We are to consider, that
				                 though Christ is greatly exalted, yet he is exalted, not
				                 as a private person for himself only, but as his people's
				                 head; he is exalted in their name, and upon their
				                 account, as the first fruits, and as representing the
				                 whole harvest. He is not exalted that he may be at a
				                 greater distance from them, but that they may be exalted
				                 with him. The exaltation and honor of the head is not to
				                 make a greater distance between the head and the members,
				                 but the members have the same relation and union with the
				                 head they had before, and are honored with the head; and
				                 instead of the distance being greater, the union shall be
				                 nearer and more perfect. When believers get to heaven,
				                 Christ will conform them to himself, as he is set down in
				                 his Father's throne, so they shall sit down with him on
				                 his throne, and shall in their measure be made like him.
				                 When Christ was going to heaven, he comforted his
				                 disciples with the thought, that after a while, he would
				                 come again and take them to himself, that they might be
				                 with him. And we are not to suppose that when the
				                 disciples got to heaven, they found him keeping a greater
				                 distance than he used to do. No, doubtless, be embraced
				                 them as friends, and welcomed them to his and their
				                 Father's house, and to his and their glory. They who had
				                 been his friends in this world, who had been together
				                 with him here, and had together partaken of sorrows and
				                 troubles, are now welcomed by him to rest, and to partake
				                 of glory with him. He took them and led them into his
				                 chambers, and showed them all his glory; as he prayed,
				                 <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference>. "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast
				                 given me, be with me, that they may behold the glory
				                 which thou hast given me." And he led them to his living
				                 fountains of waters, and made them partake of his
				                 delights, as he prays <reference osisRef="John.17.13">John 17:13</reference>. "That my joy may be
				                 fulfilled in themselves," and set them down with him at
				                 his table in his kingdom, and made them partake with him
				                 of his dainties, according to his promise, <reference osisRef="Luke.22.30">Luke 22:30</reference>,
				                 and led them into his banqueting house, and made them to
				                 drink new wine with him in the kingdom of his heavenly
				                 Father, as he foretold them when he instituted the Lord's
				                 supper, <reference osisRef="Matt.26.29">Matthew 26:29</reference>.
				</p><p>
				                 Yea the saints' conversation with Christ in heaven shall
				                 not only be as intimate, and their access to him as free,
				                 as of the disciples on earth, but in many respects much
				                 more so; for in heaven, that vital union shall be
				                 perfect, which is exceeding imperfect here. While the
				                 saints are in this world, there are great remains of sin
				                 and darkness to separate or disunite them from Christ,
				                 which shall then all be removed. This is not a time for
				                 that full acquaintance, and those glorious manifestations
				                 of love, which Christ designs for his people hereafter;
				                 which seems to be signified by his speech to Mary
				                 Magdalene, when ready to embrace him, when she met him
				                 after his resurrection; <reference osisRef="John.20.17">John 20:17</reference>. "Jesus saith unto
				                 her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my
				                 Father."
				</p><p>
				                 When the saints shall see Christ's glory and exaltation
				                 in heaven, it will indeed possess their hearts with the
				                 greater admiration and adoring respect, but it will not
				                 awe them into any separation, but will serve only to
				                 heighten their surprise and joy, when they find Christ
				                 condescending to admit them to such intimate access, and
				                 so freely and fully communicating himself to them. So
				                 that if we choose Christ for our friend and portion, we
				                 shall hereafter be so received to him, that there shall
				                 be nothing to hinder the fullest enjoyment of him, to the
				                 satisfying the utmost cravings of our souls. We may take
				                 our full swing at gratifying our spiritual appetite after
				                 these holy pleasures. Christ will then say, as in <reference osisRef="Song.5.1">Song of Solomon 5:1</reference>. "Eat, O friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly O
				                 beloved." And this shall be our entertainment to all
				                 eternity! There shall never be any end of this happiness,
				                 or any thing to interrupt our enjoyment of it, or in the
				                 least to molest us in it!
				</p><p>
				              2. By your being united to Christ, you will have a more
				                 glorious union with and enjoyment of God the Father, than
				                 otherwise could be. For hereby the saints' relation to
				                 God becomes much nearer; they are the children of God in
				                 a higher manner than otherwise could be. For, being
				                 members of God's own Son, they are in a sort partakers of
				                 his relation to the Father: they are not only sons of God
				                 by regeneration, but by a kind of communion in the
				                 sonship of the eternal Son. This seems to be intended,
				                 <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4 Gal.4.5 Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:4-6</reference>. "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,
				                 made under the law, to redeem them that are under the
				                 law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And
				                 because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
				                 his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." The
				                 church is the daughter of God not only as he hath
				                 begotten her by his word and Spirit but as she is the
				                 spouse of his eternal Son.
				</p><p>
				                 So we being members of the Son, are partakers in our
				                 measure of the Father's love to the Son, and complacence
				                 in him. <reference osisRef="John.17.23">John 17:23</reference>. "I in them, and thou in me, - Thou
				                 hast loved them as thou hast loved me." And ver. 26.
				                 "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in
				                 them." And chap. 16:27. "The Father himself loveth you,
				                 because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came
				                 out from God." So we shall, according to our capacities,
				                 be partakers of the Son's enjoyment of God, and have his
				                 joy fulfilled in ourselves, <reference osisRef="John.17.13">John 17:13</reference>. And by this means
				                 we shall come to an immensely higher, more intimate and
				                 full enjoyment of God, than otherwise could have been.
				                 For there is doubtless an infinite intimacy between the
				                 Father and the Son which is expressed by his being in the
				                 bosom of the Father. And saints being in him, shall, in
				                 their measure and manner, partake with him in it, and of
				                 the blessedness of it.
				</p><p>
				                 And thus is the affair of our redemption ordered, that
				                 thereby we are brought to an immensely more exalted kind
				                 of union with God, and enjoyment of him, both the Father
				                 and the Son, than otherwise could have been. For Christ
				                 being united to the human nature, we have advantage for a
				                 more free and full enjoyment of him, than we could have
				                 had if he had remained only in the divine nature. So
				                 again, we being united to a divine person, as his
				                 members, can have a more intimate union and intercourse
				                 with God the Father, who is only in the divine nature,
				                 than otherwise could be. Christ, who is a divine person,
				                 by taking on him our nature, descends from the infinite
				                 distance and height above us, and is brought nigh to us;
				                 whereby we have advantage for the full enjoyment of him.
				                 And, on the other hand, we, by being in Christ a divine
				                 person, do as it were ascend up to God, through the
				                 infinite distance, and have hereby advantage for the full
				                 enjoyment of him also.
				</p><p>
				            This was the design of Christ, that he, and his Father, and
				            his people, might all be united in one. <reference osisRef="John.17.21">John 17:21</reference> 23. "That
				            they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee
				            - that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe
				            that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou hast given
				            me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are
				            one; I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect
				            in one." Christ has brought it to pass, that those whom the
				            Father has given him should be brought into the household of
				            God, that he and his Father, and his people, should be as one
				            society, one family; that the church should be as it were
				            admitted into the society of the blessed Trinity.

				<title>WICKED MEN USEFUL IN THEIR DESTRUCTION ONLY</title>
				<p>				
				  <reference osisRef="Ezek.15.2 Ezek.15.3 Ezek.15.4">Ezekiel 15:2-4</reference> : Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree? Or
				  than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? Shall wood be taken
				  thereof to do any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel
				  thereon? Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; The fire devoureth both
				  the ends of it, and the midst of it is burnt: Is it meet for any work?
				</p><p>
				   THE visible church of God is here compared to the vine tree, as is
				   evident by God's own explanation of the allegory, in verses 6, 7, and
				   8. "Therefore thus saith the Lord God, As the vine tree among the trees
				   of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give
				   the inhabitants of Jerusalem," &c. And it may be understood of mankind
				   in general. We find man often in scripture compared to a vine. So in
				   chapter 32 of Deuteronomy, "Their vine is the vine of Sodom, and of the
				   fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall." And Psalm lxxx.
				   8. "Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt;" verse 14. "Look down from
				   heaven, behold, and visit this vine." And Canticles ii. 15. "The foxes
				   that spoil the vines; for our vines have tender grapes." Isaiah v. at
				   the beginning, "My beloved hath a vineyard, and he planted it with the
				   choicest vine." Jeremiah ii. 2l. "I had planted thee a noble vine."
				   Hosea x. 1. "Israel is an empty vine." So in chapter 15 of John,
				   visible Christians are compared to the branches of a vine.
				</p><p>
				   Man is very fitly represented by the vine. The weakness and dependence
				   of the vine on other things which support it, well represents to us
				   what a poor, feeble, dependent creature man is, and how, if left to
				   himself, he must fall into mischief, and cannot help himself. The
				   visible people of God are fitly compared to a vine, because of the care
				   and cultivation of the husbandman, or vine dresser. The business of
				   husbandmen in the land of Israel was very much in their vineyards,
				   about vines; and the care they exercised to fence them, to defend them,
				   to prune them, to prop them up, and to cultivate them, well represented
				   that merciful care which God exercises towards his visible people; and
				   this latter is often in scripture expressly compared to the former.
				</p><p>
				   In the words now read is represented,
				</p><p>
				   1. How wholly useless and unprofitable, even beyond other trees, a vine
				   is, in case of unfruitfulness: "What is a vine tree more than any tree,
				   or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?" i.e. if it do
				   not bear fruit. Men make much more of a vine than of other trees; they
				   take great care of it, to wall it in, to dig about it, to prune it, and
				   the like. It is much more highly esteemed than any one of the trees of
				   the forest; they are despised in comparison with it. And if it bear
				   fruit, it is indeed much preferable to other trees; for the fruit of it
				   yields a noble liquor; as it is said in Jotham's parable, Judges ix.
				   13. "And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
				   cheereth God and man?"
				</p><p>
				   But if it bear no fruit, it is more unprofitable than the trees of the
				   forest; for the wood of them is good for timber; but the wood of the
				   vine is fit for no work; as in the text, "Shall wood be taken thereof
				   to do any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel
				   thereon?"
				</p><p>
				   2. The only thing for which a vine is useful, in case of barrenness,
				   viz. for fuel: "Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel." It is
				   wholly consumed; no part of it is worth a saving, to make any
				   instrument of it, for any work.
				</p><p>
				<hi type="bold">Doctrine.</hi>
				</p><p>
				   If men bring forth no fruit to God, they are wholly useless, unless in
				   their destruction.
				</p><p>
				   For the proof of this doctrine, I shall show,
				</p><p>
				   1. That it is very evident, that there can be but two ways in which man
				   can be useful, viz. either in acting, or in being acted upon, and
				   disposed of.
				</p><p>
				   2. That man can no otherwise be useful actively than by bringing forth
				   fruit to God.
				</p><p>
				   3. That if he bring not forth fruit to God, there is no other way in
				   which he can be passively useful, but in being destroyed.
				</p><p>
				   4. In that way he may be useful without bearing fruit.
				</p><p>
				   I. There are but two ways in which man can be useful, viz. either in
				   acting or being acted upon. If man be an useful sort of creature, he
				   must be so either actively or passively: There is no medium. If he be
				   useful to any purpose, he must be so either in acting himself, or else
				   in being disposed of by some other; either in doing something himself
				   to that purpose, or else in having something done upon him by some
				   other to that purpose. What can be more plain, than that if man do
				   nothing himself, and nothing be done with him or upon him by any other,
				   he cannot be any way at all useful? If man do nothing himself to
				   promote the end of his existence, and no other being do any thing with
				   him to promote this end, then nothing will be done to promote this end;
				   and so man must be wholly useless. So that there are but two ways in
				   which man can be useful to any purpose, viz. either actively or
				   passively, either in doing something himself, or in being the subject
				   of something done to him.
				</p><p>
				   II. Man cannot be useful actively, any otherwise than in bringing forth
				   fruit to God, than in serving God, and living to his glory. This is the
				   only way wherein he can be useful in doing; and that for this reason,
				   that the glory of God is the very thing for which man was made, and to
				   which all other ends are subordinate. Man is not an independent being,
				   but he derives his being from another; and therefore hath his end
				   assigned him by that other: And he that gave him his being, made him
				   for the end now mentioned. This was the very design and aim of the
				   Author of man, this was the work for which he made him, viz. to serve
				   and glorify his Maker.
				</p><p>
				   Other creatures are made for inferior purposes. Inferior creatures were
				   made for inferior purposes. But it is to be observed, that man is the
				   creature that is highest, and nearest to God, of any in this lower
				   world; and therefore his business is with God, although other creatures
				   are made for lower ends. There my be observed a kind of gradation, or
				   gradual ascent, in the order of the different kinds of creatures, from
				   the meanest clod of earth to man, who hath a rational and immortal
				   soul. A plant, an herb, or tree, is superior in nature to a stone or
				   clod, because it hath a vegetable life. The brute creatures are a
				   degree higher still; for they have sensitive life. But man, having a
				   rational soul, is the highest of this lower creation, and is next to
				   God; therefore his business is with God.
				</p><p>
				   Things without life, as earth, water, &c. are subservient to things
				   above them, as the grass, herbs and trees. These vegetables are
				   subservient to that order of creatures which is next above them, the
				   brute creation; they are for food to them. Brute creatures, again, are
				   made for the use and service of the order above them; they are made for
				   the service of mankind. But man being the highest of this lower
				   creation, the next step from him is to God. He therefore is made for
				   the service and glory of God. This is the whole work and business of
				   man; it is his highest end, to which all other ends are subordinate.
				</p><p>
				   If it had not been for this end, there never would have been any such
				   sort of creature as man; there would have been no occasion for it.
				   Other inferior ends may be answered as well, without any such creature
				   as man. There would have been no sort of occasion for making so noble a
				   creature, and endowing him with such faculties, only to enjoy earthly
				   good, to eat, and to drink, and to enjoy sensual things. Brute
				   creatures, without reason, are capable of these things, as well as man;
				   Yea, if no higher end be aimed at than to enjoy sensitive good, reason
				   is rather an hinderance than an help. It doth but render man the more
				   capable of afflicting himself with care, and fears of death, and other
				   future evils, and of vexing himself with many anxieties, from which
				   brute creatures are wholly free, and therefore can gratify their senses
				   with less molestation. Besides, reason doth but make men more capable
				   of molesting and impeding one another in the gratification of their
				   senses. If man have no other end to seek but to gratify his senses,
				   reason is nothing but an impediment.
				</p><p>
				   Therefore if man be not made to serve and glorify his Creator, it is
				   wholly to no purpose that such a creature is made. Doubtless then the
				   all wise God, who doth all things in infinite wisdom, hath made man for
				   this end. And this is agreeable to what he hath taught us in many
				   places in the scriptures. This is the great end for which man was made,
				   and for which he was made such a creature as he is, having a body and
				   soul, bodily senses, and rational powers. For this is he placed in such
				   circumstances as he is, and the earth is given him for a possession.
				   For this he hath dominion given him over the rest of the creatures of
				   this world. For this the sun shines on him, and the moon and stars are
				   for signs and seasons to him, and the rain falls on him, and the earth
				   yields him her increase.
				</p><p>
				   All other ends of man are subordinate to this. There are inferior ends
				   for which man was made. Men were made for one another; made for their
				   friends and neighbors, and for the good of the public. But all these
				   inferior ends are designed to be subordinate to the higher end of
				   glorifying God; and therefore man cannot be actively useful, or
				   actively answer any purpose, otherwise than by actively glorifying God,
				   or bringing forth fruit to God. Because,
				</p><p>
				   1. That is not actively useful which doth not actively answer its end.
				   That which doth not answer its end is in vain; for that is the meaning
				   of the proposition, that any thing is in vain. So that which doth not
				   actively answer its end, is, as to its own activity, in vain.
				</p><p>
				   2. That is as to its own activity altogether useless which actively
				   answers only subordinate ends, without answering the ultimate end; and
				   that because the ultimate end is the end of subordinate ends. The
				   notion of a supreme end is, that it is the end of all inferior ends.
				   Subordinate ends are to no purpose, only as they stand related to the
				   highest end. The very notion of a subordinate end is, that it is in
				   order to a further end. Therefore these inferior ends are good for
				   nothing though they be obtained, unless they also obtain their end.
				   Inferior ends are not aimed at for their own sake, but only for the
				   sake of the ultimate end. Therefore he that fails of his great end of
				   all, doth as much altogether fail of his end, and is as much to no
				   purpose, as if he did not obtain his subordinate end.
				</p><p>
				   I will illustrate this by two or three examples. The subordinate end of
				   the underpinning of an house is to support the house; and the
				   subordinate end of the windows is to let in the light. But the ultimate
				   end of the whole is the benefit of the inhabitants. Therefore, if the
				   house be never inhabited, the whole is in vain. The underpinning is in
				   vain, though it be ever so strong and support the building ever so
				   well. The windows also are wholly in vain, though they be ever so large
				   and clear, and though they obtain the subordinate end of letting in the
				   light: They are as much in vain, as if they let in no light.
				</p><p>
				   So the subordinate end of the husbandman in ploughing and sowing, and
				   well manuring his field is, that it may bring forth a crop. But his
				   more ultimate end is, that food may be provided for him and his family.
				   Therefore though his inferior end be obtained, and his field bring
				   forth ever so good a crop, yet if after all it be consumed by fire, or
				   otherwise destroyed, he ploughed and sowed his field as much in vain,
				   as if the seed had never sprung up.
				</p><p>
				   So if man obtain his subordinate ends ever so fully; yet if he
				   altogether fail of his ultimate end, he is wholly an useless creature.
				   Thus if men be very useful in temporal things to their families, or
				   greatly promote the temporal interest of the neighborhood, or of the
				   public; yet if no glory be brought to God by it, they are altogether
				   useless. If men actively bring no glory to God, they are, as to their
				   own activity, altogether useless, how much soever they may promote the
				   benefit of one another. How much soever one part of mankind may
				   subserve another; yet if the end of the whole be not answered, every
				   part is useless.
				</p><p>
				   Thus if the parts of a clock subserve ever so well one to another,
				   mutually to assist each other in their motions; one wheel moving
				   another ever so regularly; yet if the motion never reach the hand or
				   the hammer, it is altogether in vain, as much as if it stood still. As
				   in a clock one wheel moves another, and that another, till at last the
				   motion comes to the hand and hammer, which immediately respect the eye
				   and the ear, otherwise all the motions are in vain; so it is in the
				   world, one man was made to be useful to another, and one part of
				   mankind to another; but the use of the whole is to bring glory to God
				   the maker or else all is in vain; and however a man may serve among his
				   fellow creatures, in a private or public capacity, upon the whole he is
				   in vain.
				</p><p>
				   It may perhaps be objected, that a wicked man may, by being serviceable
				   to the public, be useful to many who do bring forth fruit to God, and
				   thus glorify him.
				</p><p>
				   Answer 1. If he be so, he is no further useful than he brings glory to
				   God. It all hath an ultimate respect to that glory that is brought to
				   God, and is useful no further; as the motion of no one wheel of a clock
				   is any further useful, than as it finally respects the right pointing
				   of the hand, and striking of the hammer.
				</p><p>
				   Answer 2. When it is thus, wicked men are useful only accidentally, and
				   not designedly. Although a wicked man may, by being serviceable to good
				   men, do what will be an advantage to them to their bringing forth fruit
				   to God; yet that serviceableness is not what he aims at; this is not
				   his end; he doth not look so far for an ultimate end. And how ever this
				   end be obtained, no thanks are due to him; it is as to him accidental.
				   He is only the occasion, and not the designing cause of it. That fruit
				   which is brought forth to the glory of God, is not brought forth by
				   him, but by others.
				</p><p>
				   The usefulness of such a man, being not designed, is not to be
				   attributed to him as though it were his fruit. He is not useful as a
				   man, or as a rational creature, because he is not so designedly. He is
				   useful as things without life may be. Things without life may he useful
				   to put the godly under advantages to bring forth fruit, as the timber
				   and stones with which his house is built, the wool and flax with which
				   he is clothed; but the fruit which is brought forth to God's glory,
				   cannot be said for all that to be the fruit of these lifeless things,
				   but of the godly man who makes use of them. So it is when wicked men
				   put the godly under advantages to glorify God, as Cyrus, and
				   Artaxerxes, and others have done.
				</p><p>
				   III. If men bring not forth fruit to God, there is no other way in
				   which they can be useful passively, but in being destroyed. They are
				   fit for nothing else.
				</p><p>
				   1. They are not fit to be suffered to continue always in this world.
				   God suffers them to live for the present, but it is only for a certain
				   season. They are here in a transitory state. It is not fit that this
				   world should be the constant abode of those who bring forth no fruit to
				   God. It is not fit that the barren tree should be allowed always to
				   stand in the vineyard. The husbandman lets it stand for a while, till
				   he digs about it, dungs it, and proves it to be incurable, or till a
				   convenient time to cut it down come; but it is not fit that such a tree
				   should stand here always. It is not fit that they who bring forth no
				   fruit to God, should be suffered to live always in a world which is so
				   full of the goodness of God, or that his goodness should be spent upon
				   them forever.
				</p><p>
				   This world, though it is fallen, and is under a curse, and is a
				   miserable place to what it once was, yet is full of the streams of
				   divine goodness. But it is not fit that those who bring forth no fruit
				   to God, should always be continued in partaking of these streams. There
				   are these three different states ; a state wherein is nothing but good,
				   which is the state of the blessed in heaven; a state wherein is a
				   mixture of good and evil, which is the earthly state ; and a state
				   wherein is nothing but evil, which is the state of eternal destruction
				   and damnation. Now they that bring forth no fruit to God, are not fit
				   for either of the former; it is not fit that they should be continued
				   in the enjoyment of any of the goodness of God.
				</p><p>
				   It is not fit that an unprofitable, unfruitful creature, who will not
				   glorify his Creator, should always live here to devour the fruits of
				   the earth, and consume the fruits of divine bounty; to have the good
				   things of this life, as God's wool and his flax, his corn, and wine,
				   and oil, spent with him in vain. While a man lives in this world, the
				   other creatures of the world are subjected to him. The brute creatures
				   serve him with their labor and with their lives. The sun, moon, and
				   stars, the clouds, fields and trees, all serve him. But it is not fit
				   that these creatures should always be made to serve him, who brings
				   forth no fruit to the Creator. Why should God always keep his creatures
				   in subjection to that man, who will not be subject to him? Why should
				   the creation be always kept in such bondage, as to be subject to wicked
				   men? The creatures are made subject to vanity for a little time; God
				   hath subjected them to wicked men, and given them for their use. This
				   however he would not have done, but as it is only for a little while;
				   and the creatures can bear it through the hope of approaching
				   deliverance; and otherwise it would have been intolerable. Romans viii.
				   20. "For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
				   reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope."
				</p><p>
				   The creature doth, as it were, groan by reason of this subjection to
				   wicked men, although it be but for a while. Romans viii.22. "For we
				   know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together
				   until now." Therefore surely it would be no way fit that wicked men,
				   who do no good, and bring forth no fruit to God, should live here
				   always, to have the various creatures subservient to them, as they are
				   now. The earth can scarcely bear wicked men during that short time for
				   which they stay here, but is ready to spew thee out. It is no way fit,
				   therefore, that it should be forced to bear them always.
				</p><p>
				   Men who bring forth no fruit to God are cumberers of the ground. Luke
				   xiii. 7 "And it is not meet that they should be suffered to cumber the
				   ground always." God cannot be glorified in this way of disposing of
				   unfruitful persons. If such men should be suffered to live always in
				   such a state as this, it would be so far from being to the glory of
				   God, that it would be to the disparagement of the wisdom of God, to
				   continue them in a state so unsuitable for them, forever spending the
				   fruits of his bounty in vain upon them. It would also be a
				   disparagement to his justice; for this is a world where, "all things
				   come alike to all, and there is one event to the righteous and to the
				   wicked." If there were no other state but this for wicked men to be in,
				   justice could not possibly take place. It would also reflect upon the
				   holiness of God. Forever to uphold this world for an habitation of such
				   persons, and forever to continue the communications of his bounty and
				   goodness to them, would appear as though he were disposed to
				   countenance and encourage sin and wickedness.
				</p><p>
				   2. If men do not bring forth fruit to God, they are not fit to be
				   disposed of in heaven. Heaven, above all others, is the most improper
				   place for them. Every thing appertaining to that state is unsuitable
				   for them. The company is most unsuitable. The original inhabitants of
				   that world are the angels. But what a disagreeable union would that be,
				   to unite wicked men and angels in the same society? The employments of
				   that world are unsuitable. The employments are serving and glorifying
				   God. How unsuitable then would it be to plant barren trees in that
				   heavenly paradise, trees that would bring forth no fruit to the divine
				   glory? The enjoyments of heaven are unsuitable. The enjoyments are holy
				   and spiritual enjoyments, the happiness of beholding the glory of God,
				   and praising his name, and the like. But these enjoyments are as
				   unsuitable as can be to the carnal earthly minds of wicked men. They
				   would be no enjoyments to them; but on the contrary would be most
				   disagreeable, and what they cannot relish, but entirely nauseate.
				</p><p>
				   The design of heaven is unsuitable to them. The design of God in making
				   heaven was, that it might be a place of holy habitation, for the reward
				   of the righteous, and not an habitation for wicked men. It would
				   greatly reflect on the wisdom of God to dispose of wicked men there;
				   for it would be the greatest confusion. But God is not the author of
				   confusion, I Corinthians xiv. 33. It would be contrary to the holiness
				   of God, to take wicked men so near to himself into his glorious
				   presence, to dwell forever in that part of the creation which is, as it
				   were, his own palace, and to sit at his table. We read in Psalm v. 4.
				   "Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall
				   evil dwell with thee." Therefore it would doubtless be impossible that
				   the end of the existence of wicked men should be in any wise answered
				   by the placing of them in heaven.
				</p><p>
				   IV. Men who bring forth no fruit to God, yet in suffering destruction
				   may be useful. Although they be not useful actively, or by any thing
				   which they do; yet they may be useful in what they may suffer; just as
				   a barren tree, which is no way useful standing in the vineyard, yet may
				   be good fuel, and be very useful in the fire. God can find use for the
				   most wicked men; he hath his use for vessels of wrath as well as for
				   vessels of mercy; as in an house there is use for vessels unto
				   dishonor, as well as for vessels unto honor. 2 Timothy ii. 20. "In a
				   great house there are not only vessels of gold, and of silver, but also
				   of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor."
				   Proverbs xvi. 4. "The Lord hath made all things for himself; yea, even
				   the wicked for the day of evil." I shall briefly take notice of what
				   ends God accomplishes by it.
				</p><p>
				   1. Unfruitful persons are of use in their destruction for the glory of
				   God's justice. It was the will of God to glorify his justice, as well
				   as his mercy, on his creatures. The vindictive justice of God is a
				   glorious attribute, as well as his mercy; and the glory of this
				   attribute appears in the everlasting destruction and ruin of the barren
				   and unfruitful.
				</p><p>
				   The glory of divine justice in the perdition of ungodly men appears
				   wonderful and glorious in the eyes of the saints and angels in heaven.
				   Hence we have an account, that they sing praises to God, and extol his
				   justice at the sight of the awful judgments which he inflicts on wicked
				   men. Revelation xvi. 5, "Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art and
				   wast, and art to come, because thou hast judged thus; for they have
				   shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood
				   to drink; for they are worthy:" And Revelation xix. 1, 2: "And after
				   these things I heard a great voice, saying, Alleluia: Salvation, and
				   glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and
				   righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore, which
				   did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood
				   of his servants at her hand."
				</p><p>
				   2. Unfruitful persons in their destruction are of use for God to
				   glorify his majesty upon them. The awful majesty of God remarkably
				   appears in those dreadful and amazing punishments which he inflicts on
				   those who rise up against him, and contemn him. A sense of the majesty
				   of an earthly prince is supported very much by a sense of its being a
				   dreadful thing to affront him. God glorifies his own majesty in the
				   destruction of wicked men; and herein he appears infinitely great, in
				   that it appears to be an infinitely dreadful thing to offend him. How
				   awful doth the majesty of God appear in the dreadfulness of his anger!
				   This we may learn to be one end of the damnation of the wicked, from
				   Romans ix. 22. "What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his
				   power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath
				   fitted to destruction?"
				</p><p>
				   It is often spoken of God, that he is a terrible God. It is a part of
				   the majesty and glory of God, that he is a terrible God. God tells
				   Pharaoh, that for this cause he raised him up, that he might show his
				   power in him, and that his name might be declared through all the
				   earth, in his destruction. Exodus ix. 15, 16; and again, chapter xiv.
				   17: "I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his
				   chariots, and upon his horsemen."
				</p><p>
				   3. The destruction of the unfruitful is of use, to give the saints a
				   greater sense of their happiness, and of God's grace to them. The
				   wicked will be destroyed and tormented in the view of the saints, and
				   other inhabitants of heaven. This we are taught in Revelation xiv. 10.
				   "The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured
				   out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation ; and he shall be
				   tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels,
				   and in the presence of the Lamb." And in Isaiah lxvi. 24. "And they
				   shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have
				   transgressed against me : For their worm shall not die, neither shall
				   their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."
				</p><p>
				   When the saints in heaven shall look upon the damned in hell, it will
				   serve to give them a greater sense of their own happiness, seeing how
				   vastly different their case is from their own. The view of the doleful
				   condition of the damned will make them the more prize their own
				   blessedness. When they shall see how dreadful the anger of God is, it
				   will make them the more prize his love. They will rejoice so much the
				   more that they are not the objects of God's anger, but of his favor;
				   that they are not the subjects of his dreadful wrath, but are treated
				   as his children, are taken near to him, to dwell in the everlasting
				   embraces of his love.
				</p><p>
				   When they shall see the misery of the damned, it will give them a
				   greater sense of the distinguishing grace and love of God to them, that
				   God should from all eternity set his love on them, and make so great a
				   difference between them and others who are of the same species with
				   them, are no worse by nature than they, and have deserved no worse of
				   God than they. When they shall look upon the misery of the damned, and
				   consider how different their own state is from theirs, and that it is
				   only free and sovereign grace that makes the difference, what a great
				   sense will this give them of the wonderful grace of God to them! And
				   how will it heighten their praises! With how much greater admiration
				   and exultation of soul will they sing of the free and sovereign grace
				   of God to them!
				</p><p>
				   When they shall look upon the damned, and see their misery, how will
				   heaven ring with the praises of God's justice towards the wicked, and
				   his grace towards the saints! And with how much greater enlargement of
				   heart will they praise Jesus Christ their Redeemer, that ever he was
				   pleased to set his love upon them, his dying love! And that he should
				   so distinguish them as to spill his blood, and make his soul an
				   offering, to redeem them from that so great misery, and to bring them
				   to such exceeding happiness!
				</p><p>
				   With what love and ecstasy will they sing that song in Revelation v. 9.
				   10. "Thou art worthy: For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God
				   by thy blood, out of every tongue, and kindred, and people, and nation;
				   and hast made us unto our God kings and priests." One end which the
				   apostle mentions why God appointed vessels of wrath, is the more to
				   make known the wonderfulness of his mercy towards the saints. In Romans
				   ix. 22, 23. there are two ends mentioned: "What if God, willing to show
				   his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long
				   suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?" That is one end,
				   then another is mentioned immediately after: "And that he might make
				   known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had
				   afore prepared unto glory ?"
				</p><p>
				<hi type="bold">Application</hi>
				</p><p>
				   I. Hence we may learn, how just and righteous God is in the destruction
				   of those who bring forth no fruit to God. Seeing there is no other way
				   in which they can be useful, or in which the end of their being can be
				   obtained, certainly it is most just that God should thus dispose of
				   them. Why should God be frustrated of his end through their
				   perverseness? If men will not do the work for which he hath made and
				   fitted them; if they, through a spirit of opposition and rebellion
				   against God, refuse; yet why should God suffer himself to be
				   disappointed of his end in making them? It doth not become the infinite
				   greatness and majesty of God, to suffer himself to be disappointed and
				   frustrated by the wickedness and perverseness of sinful worms of the
				   dust. If God should suffer this, it would seem to argue, either a want
				   of wisdom in God to fix upon a good end, or a want of power to
				   accomplish it.
				</p><p>
				   God made all men that they might be useful; and if they will not be
				   useful in their conduct and actions, how just is it that God should
				   make them useful in their sufferings! God made all men for his own
				   glory; and if they, contrary to the revealed will of God, refuse to
				   glorify him actively and willingly, how just is it that God should
				   glorify himself upon them in what he doth with them!
				</p><p>
				   It hath been shown, that there is no other way wherein this can be
				   done, but by their destruction. Surely, therefore, it must be just and
				   righteous that God should destroy them.
				</p><p>
				   Men are under no natural necessity of being put to this use of
				   glorifying God in their sufferings. God gives them opportunity of
				   glorifying him in doing, in bringing forth fruit, puts them under
				   advantages for it, and uses many means to bring them to it. But if they
				   will not be useful this way, it is very just that God should make them
				   useful in the only remaining way in which they can be useful, viz. in
				   their destruction. God is not forward to put them to this use. He tells
				   us, that he hath "no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the
				   wicked turn from his way, and live;" Ezekiel xxxiii. 11. God represents
				   the destruction of sinners as a work to which he is backward; yet it is
				   meet that they should be destroyed, rather than that they should be
				   suffered to frustrate God of the end of their being. Who can blame the
				   husbandman for cutting down and burning a barren tree, after he hath
				   digged about it, and dunged it, and used all proper means to make it
				   fruitful?
				</p><p>
				   Let those among us consider this, who have lived all their lives
				   hitherto unprofitably, and never have brought forth any fruit to God's
				   glory, notwithstanding all the means that have been used with them.
				   Consider how just it would be if God should utterly destroy you, and
				   glorify himself upon you in that way; and what a wonder of patience it
				   is, that God hath not done it before now.
				</p><p>
				   II. This subject ought to put you upon examining yourselves, whether
				   you be not wholly useless creatures. You have now heard, that those who
				   bring forth no fruit to God, are, as to any good they do, wholly
				   useless. Inquire, therefore, whether you have ever in your lives
				   brought forth any fruit to God. Have you ever done any thing from a
				   gracious respect to God, or out of love to God? By only seeking your
				   worldly interest, you do not bring forth fruit to God. It is toot
				   bringing forth fruit to God, for you to come to public worship on the
				   Sabbath, to pray in your families, and other such like things, merely
				   in compliance with the general custom. It is not to bring forth fruit
				   to God, that you be sober, moral and religious, only to be seen of men,
				   or out of respect to your own credit and honor. How is that for God
				   which is only for the sake of custom, or the esteem of men?
				</p><p>
				   It is not to bring forth fruit to God, for men to pray, and read, and
				   hear, and to be strict and diligent in religious and moral duties,
				   merely from the fear of hell. What thanks are due to you for not loving
				   your own misery, and for being willing to take some pains to escape
				   burning in hell to all eternity? There is ne'er a devil in hell but
				   would gladly do the same. Hosea x. 1. "Israel is an empty vine; he
				   bringeth forth fruit unto himself."
				</p><p>
				   There is no fruit brought forth to God, where there is nothing done in
				   any wise from love to God, or from any true respect to him. God looketh
				   at the heart. He doth not stand in need of our services, neither is he
				   benefited by any thing that we can do. He doth not receive any thing of
				   us, because it benefits him, but only as a suitable testimony of our
				   love and respect to him. This is the fruit that he seeks. Men
				   themselves will not accept of those shows of friendship, which they
				   think are hypocritical, and come not from the heart. How much less
				   should God, who searcheth the hearts and trieth the reins of the
				   children of men! John iv. 23. "God is a spirit, and they that worship
				   him must worship him in spirit and in truth."
				</p><p>
				   Inquire, therefore, whether you ever in your lives did the least thing
				   out of love to God. Have you not done all for yourselves? Zechariah
				   vii. 5, 6. "When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month,
				   even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even unto me? And
				   when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did ye not eat for yourselves,
				   and drink for yourselves? "
				</p><p>
				   III. Another use of this subject may be of conviction and humiliation
				   to those who never have brought forth any fruit to God. If, upon
				   examination, you find that you have never in all your lives done any
				   thing out of a true respect to God, then it hath been demonstrated,
				   that, as to any thing which you do, you are altogether useless
				   creatures. And consider, what a shameful thing it is for such rational
				   beings as you are, and placed under such advantages for usefulness, yet
				   to be wholly useless, and to live in the world to no purpose!
				</p><p>
				   We esteem it a very mean character in any person, that he is a
				   worthless, insignificant person; and to be called so is taken as a
				   great reproach. But consider seriously, whether you can clear
				   yourselves of this character. Set reason to work; can you rationally
				   suppose, that you do in any measure answer the end for which God gave
				   you your being, and made you of a nature superior to the beasts? But
				   that you may be sensible what cause you have to be ashamed of your
				   unprofitableness, consider the following things.
				</p><p>
				   1. How much God hath bestowed upon you, in the endowments of your
				   nature. God hath made you rational, intelligent creatures, hath endowed
				   you with noble powers, those endowments wherein the natural image of
				   God consists. You are vastly exalted in your nature above other kinds
				   of creatures here below. You are capable of a thousand times as much as
				   any of the brute creatures. He hath given you a power of understanding,
				   which is capable of vastly extending itself, of looking back to the
				   beginning of time, and of considering what was before the world was,
				   and of looking forward beyond the end of time. It is capable of
				   extending beyond the utmost limits of the universe; and is a faculty
				   whereby you are akin to angels, and are capable even of knowing God, of
				   contemplating the divine Being, and his glorious perfections,
				   manifested in his works and in his word. You have souls capable of
				   being the habitation of the Holy Spirit of God, and his divine grace.
				   You are capable of the noble employments of angels.
				</p><p>
				   How lamentable and shameful it is, that such a creature should be
				   altogether useless, and live in vain! How lamentable that such a noble
				   and excellent piece of divine workmanship should fail of its end, and
				   be to no purpose! Was it ever worth while for God to make you such a
				   creature, with such a noble nature, and so much above other kinds of
				   creatures, only to eat, and drink, and gratify your sensual appetites?
				   How lamentable and shameful to you, that such a noble tree should be
				   more useless than any tree of the forest; that man, whom God hath thus
				   set in honor, should make himself more worthless than the beasts that
				   perish!
				</p><p>
				   2. How much God hath done for you in the creation of the world. He made
				   the earth, and seas, and all the fulness of them, for the use of man,
				   and hath given them to him. Psalm cxv. 16. "The earth hath he given to
				   the children of men." He made the vast variety of creatures for man's
				   use and service. Genesis i. 28. "Have dominion over the fish of the
				   sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
				   moveth upon the earth." For the same purpose he made all the plants,
				   and herbs, and trees of the field. Genesis i. 29. "I have given you
				   every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and
				   every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree, yielding seed; to you
				   it shall be for meat." He made the sun in the heavens, that glorious
				   luminary, that wonderful globe of light, to give light to man, and to
				   constitute the difference between day and night. He also made the moon,
				   and the vast multitude of stars, for the use of man, to be to him for
				   signs and seasons.
				</p><p>
				   What great provision hath God made for man! What a vast variety of good
				   things for food, and otherwise to be for his convenience, to put him
				   under advantages to be useful! How lamentable is it, that after all
				   these things he should be an useless creature in the world!
				</p><p>
				   3. How much is done for you in the course of God's common providence!
				   Consider how nature is continually laboring for you. The sun is, at it
				   were, in a ferment for mankind, unweariedly running his course from
				   year to year, and from day to day, and spending his rays upon man, to
				   put him under advantage to be useful; every day giving him light that
				   he may have opportunity to behold the glorious wisdom of God, and to
				   see and serve God. The winds and clouds are continually laboring for
				   you, and the waters are going in a constant circulation, ascending in
				   the air from the seas, descending in rain, gathering in streams and
				   rivers, returning to the sea, and again ascending and descending, for
				   you. The earth is continually laboring to bring forth her fruit for
				   your support. The trees of the field are laboring and spending their
				   strength for you. And how many of the poor brute creatures are
				   continually laboring for you, and spending their strength for you! How
				   much of the earth is spent upon you! How many of God's creatures are
				   devoured by you! How many of the lives of the living creatures of God
				   are destroyed for your sake, for your support and comfort!
				</p><p>
				   Now, how lamentable will it be, if, after all, you be altogether
				   useless, and live to no purpose! What mere cumberers of the ground will
				   you be! Agreeably to Luke xiii. 7. Nature, which thus continually
				   labors for you, will be burdened with you. This seems to be what the
				   apostle means, Romans viii. 20, 21, 22, where he tells us, that the
				   creation is made subject to vanity, and brought into the bondage of
				   corruption; and that the whole creation groans, and travails in pain,
				   under this bondage.
				</p><p>
				   4. How much is done for you in the use of the means of grace. How much
				   hath God done to provide you with suitable means and advantages for
				   usefulness! How many prophets hath God sent into the world, in
				   different ages, inspiring them with his Holy Spirit, and enabling them
				   to work many miracles to confirm their word, whereby you now have the
				   written word of God to instruct you!
				</p><p>
				   How great a thing hath God done for you, to give you opportunity and
				   advantage to be useful, in that he hath sent his own Son into the
				   world! He who is really and truly God, united himself to the human
				   nature, and became a man, to be a prophet an teacher to you and other
				   sinners. Yea, he laid down his life to make atonement for sin, that you
				   might have encouragement to serve God with hopes of acceptance.
				</p><p>
				   How many ordinances have been instituted for you! How much of the labor
				   of the ministers of God hath been spent upon you! Is not that true
				   concerning you which is written in Isaiah v. at the beginning,
				   concerning the vineyard planted in a very fruitful hill, and fenced and
				   cultivated with peculiar care and pains, which yet proved unfruitful?
				   How much hath the dresser of the vineyard digged about the barren tree,
				   and dunged it, and yet it remains barren!
				</p><p>
				   Consider what a shame it is that you should live in vain, when all the
				   other creatures, that are inferior to you, do glorify their Creator,
				   according to their nature. You who are so highly exalted in the world,
				   are more useless than the brute creation; yea, than the meanest worms,
				   or things without life, as earth and stones: For they all do answer
				   their end, in the way in which nature hath fitted them for it; none of
				   them fail of it. They are all useful in their places, all render their
				   proper tribute of praise to their Creator; while you are mere nuisances
				   in the creation, and burdens to the earth; as any tree of the forest is
				   more useful than the vine, if it bear not fruit.
				</p><p>
				   IV. Let me, in a farther application of this doctrine, exhort you by
				   all means to bring forth fruit to God. Let it be your constant endeavor
				   to be in this way actively useful in the world. Here consider three
				   things.
				</p><p>
				   1. What an honor it will be to such poor creatures as you are, to bring
				   forth fruit to the divine glory. What is such a poor worm as man, that
				   he should be enabled to bring forth any fruit to God! It is the
				   greatest honor of the nature of man, that God hath given him a capacity
				   of glorifying the great Creator. It is what no other creature in this
				   lower world can do, in the same manner as man. There is no creature in
				   the visible world that is capable of actively glorifying God, but man.
				</p><p>
				   2. In bringing forth fruit to God, you will be so profitable to none as
				   to yourselves; you cannot thereby be profitable to God. Job xxii. 2.
				   "Can a man be profitable to God?" You may thereby be profitable to your
				   fellow creatures; yet not so much as to yourselves. The fruit which you
				   bring forth to God will be a greater benefit to yourselves than to any
				   one living. You will be more useful to yourselves than to any one else.
				   Although you are under a natural obligation to bring forth fruit to
				   God, yet God doth not require it of you without a reward. He will
				   richly reward you for it. In requiring you to bring forth fruit to him,
				   he doth but require you to bring forth fruit to your own happiness. You
				   will taste the sweetness of your own fruit. It will be most profitable
				   for you in this world to bring forth fruit to God; it will be
				   exceedingly to your benefit while here. It will be pleasant to you to
				   lead a fruitful and holy life; the pleasure will be beyond the labor.
				   Beside this, God hath promised to such a life everlasting rewards,
				   unspeakable, infinite benefits. So that by it you will infinitely
				   advance your own interest.
				</p><p>
				   3. If you remain thus unprofitable, and be not actively useful, surely
				   God will obtain his end of you, in your destruction. He will say
				   concerning the barren tree, "Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?"
				   Christ, in John xv. 6, tells us, "if a man abide not in me, he is cast
				   forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them
				   into the fire, and they are burned." This is spoken of the barren
				   branches in the vine. How would you yourselves do in such a case with a
				   barren tree in an orchard, or with weeds and tares in your fields?
				   Doubtless, it were in your power, you would utterly destroy them.
				</p><p>
				   God will have his end; he will accomplish it. Though all men and devils
				   unite their endeavors, they cannot frustrate God in any thing; and
				   "though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished;"
				   Proverbs xi. 1. God hath sworn by his great name, that he will have his
				   glory of men, whether they will actively glorify him or no. Numbers
				   xiv. 21, 22, 23. "But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled
				   with the glory of the Lord. Because all those men which have seen my
				   glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and
				   have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
				   voice; surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
				   fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me, see it."
				</p><p>
				   "The ax lieth at the root of the trees; and every tree which bringeth
				   not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire;" Matthew
				   iii. 10. The end of those men who bring forth nothing but briers and
				   thorns is to be burned, as in Hebrews vi. 7, 8. "For the earth which
				   drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs
				   meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: But
				   that which beareth thorns and briers, is rejected, and is nigh unto
				   cursing; whose end is to be burned." So we read of the tares, Matthew
				   xiii. 30. "Let both grow together until the harvest ; and in the time
				   of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
				   tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them;" and in verses 40, 41,
				   42, "As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so
				   shall it be at the end of the world. The Son of man shall send forth
				   his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that
				   offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace
				   of fire: There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
				</p><p>
				   So it is said of the chaff, Matthew iii. 12. "Whose fan is in his hand,
				   and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the
				   garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
				</p><p>
				   If you continue not to bring forth any fruit to the divine glory, as
				   you have hitherto done, hell will be the only fit place for you. It is
				   a place prepared on purpose to be a receptacle of such persons. In hell
				   nature ceases to labor any more for sinners: The sun doth not run his
				   course to shine upon them, the earth doth not bring forth her fruit to
				   be consumed upon them there. There they will have no opportunity to
				   consume the fruits of divine goodness on their lusts. In hell they can
				   prejudice or encumber nothing, upon which God sets any value. There the
				   faithful servants and ministers of God will no longer spend their
				   strength in vain upon them. When the barren tree is in the fire, the
				   servants of the husbandman are freed from any further labor or toil in
				   digging about it, and manuring it.
				</p><p>
				   In hell they will no more have opportunity to clog and discourage the
				   flourishing of religion, and to destroy much good, as they often do in
				   this world. In hell they will no more have opportunity to corrupt
				   others by their ill example. In hell they will no more have it in their
				   power to offend the godly; they may hurt and torment one another; but
				   the godly will be out of their reach. In hell there will be no
				   ordinances, no Sabbaths, no sacraments, no sacred things, for them to
				   profane and defile by their careless and hypocritical attendance.
				</p><p>
				   Hell, therefore, if you remain unfruitful and cumberers of the ground,
				   will be the fittest place for you, and there you will surely have your
				   portion assigned you. There God will get himself honor upon you; there
				   he will magnify himself in your ruin, in the presence of the holy
				   angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and will be praised upon that
				   account by the saints, at the day of judgment; and by all the host of
				   heaven throughout everlasting ages.

				<title>The Vain Self-Flatteries of the Sinner</title>
				<p>
				  <reference osisRef="Ps.36.2">Psalms 36:2</reference> : For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
				  found to be hateful.
				</p><p>
				   IN the foregoing verse, David says, that the transgression of the
				   wicked said within his heart, "that there is no fear of God before his
				   eyes;" that is, when he saw that the wicked went on in sin, in an
				   allowed way of wickedness, it convinced him, that he was not afraid of
				   those terrible judgments, and of that wrath with which God hath
				   threatened sinners If he were afraid of these he could never go on so
				   securely in sin, as he doth.
				</p><p>
				   In our text he gives the reason why the wicked did not fear. It was a
				   strange thing that men, who enjoyed such light as they did in the land
				   of Israel, who read and heard those many awful threatenings which were
				   written in the book of the law, should not be afraid to go on in sin.
				   But saith the Psalmist, They flatter themseIves in their own eyes: They
				   have something or other which they make a foundation of encouragement,
				   whereby they persuade themselves that they shall escape those
				   judgments; and that makes them put far away the evil day.
				</p><p>
				   In this manner he proceeds, until his iniquity be found to be hateful;
				   that is, until he finds by experience that it is a more dreadful thing
				   to sin against God, and break his holy commands, than he imagined. He
				   thinks sin to be sweet, and hides it as a sweet morsel under his
				   tongue: He loves it, and flatters himself in it, till at length he
				   finds, by experience, that it is bitter as gall and wormwood. Though he
				   thinks the commission of sin to be lovely, yet he will find the fruit
				   of it to be hateful, and what he cannot endure. Proverbs xxiii. 32. "At
				   last it will bite like a serpent, and sting like an adder."
				</p><p>
				   Here observe,
				</p><p>
				   1. The subject spoken of is the wicked man, of whom the Psalmist had
				   been speaking in the foregoing verse.
				</p><p>
				   2. His action in flattering himself in his own eyes; i.e. he makes
				   himself and his case to appear to himself, or in his own eyes, better
				   than it is.
				</p><p>
				   3. How long he continues so to do, until his iniquity be found to be
				   hateful. 'Which may be taken for his sin itself, the wicked will see
				   how odious sin is to God', when he shall feel the effects of his
				   hatred, and how hateful to angels and saints; or rather the cause is
				   here put for the effect, the tree for its fruit, and he will find his
				   iniquity to be hateful, as he will find the hatefulness and feel the
				   terribleness of the fruit of his iniquity.
				</p><p>
				<hi type="bold">Doctrine</hi>
				</p><p>
				   Wicked men generally flatter themselves with hopes of escaping
				   punishment, till it actually comes upon them.
				</p><p>
				   There are but few sinners who despair, who give up the cause and
				   conclude with themselves, that they shall go to hell; yet there are but
				   few who do not go to hell. It is to be feared that men go to hell every
				   day out of this country; yet very few of them suffer themselves to
				   believe, that they are in any great danger of that punishment. They go
				   on sinning and travelling in the direct road to the pit; yet by one
				   mean or other they persuade themselves that they shall never fall into
				   it,
				</p><p>
				   In my present discourse, I shall,
				</p><p>
				   1. Mention some things in confirmation of the doctrine, that sinners
				   flatter themselves with the hope of impunity.
				</p><p>
				   2. Mention some of the various ways wherein sinners flatter themselves
				   in that hope.
				</p><p>
				   3. Show that sinners generally go on flattering themselves, till
				   punishment actually overtakes them.
				</p><p>
				   I. I am to mention some things in confirmation of the doctrine, that
				   sinners flatter themselves with the hope of future impunity.
				</p><p>
				   1. We are so taught in the word of God. Beside our text, you may see,
				   Deuteronomy xxix. 18, 19. "Lest there should be among you man, or
				   woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the
				   Lord our God. Lest there should he among you a root that beareth gall
				   and wormwood, "and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this
				   curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace,
				   though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to
				   thirst." Where it is supposed that they whose hearts turn away from
				   God, and are roots that bear gall and wormwood, generally bless
				   themselves in their hearts, saying, we shall have peace.
				</p><p>
				   See also Psalm xlix. 17,18. "When he dieth, he shall carry nothing
				   away: His glory shall not descend after him, though while he lived, he
				   blessed his soul." And Psalm 1:21. "These things thou hast done. and I
				   kept silence: Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as
				   thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thee."
				</p><p>
				   2. It is very evident, that sinners flatter themselves that they shall
				   escape punishment, by this, that otherwise they would be in dreadful
				   and continual distress. Otherwise, as long as they are in sin, they
				   could never live and go about so cheerfully as they now do: Their lives
				   would be filled with sorrow and mourning, and they would be in
				   continual uneasiness and distress; as much as those that are exercised
				   with some violent pain of body. But it is evident that it is not in
				   fact so; it is apparent that men are careless and secure; that they are
				   not much concerned about future punishment, and that they cheerfully
				   pursue their business and recreations. Therefore they undoubtedly
				   flatter themselves, that they shall not be eternally miserable in hell,
				   as they are threatened in the word of God
				</p><p>
				   3. It is evident that they flatter themselves with hopes that they
				   shall escape punishment, as otherwise they would certainly be
				   restrained at least from many of those sins in which they now live:
				   They would not proceed in wilful courses of sin. The transgression of
				   the wicked convinced the Psalmist, and is enough to convince every one,
				   that there is no fear of God before his eyes, and that he flatters
				   himself in his own eyes. It would be impossible for men allowedly from
				   day to day to do those very things, which they know are threatened with
				   everlasting destruction, if they did not some way encourage themselves,
				   they should nevertheless escape that destruction.
				</p><p>
				   II. I shall mention some of the various ways wherein sinners flatter
				   themselves in their own eyes.
				</p><p>
				   1. Some flatter themselves with a secret hope, that there is no such
				   thing as another world. They hear a great deal of preaching, and a
				   great deal of talk about hell, and about the eternal judgment; but
				   those things do not seem to them to be real. They never saw any thing
				   of them; they never saw hell, never saw the devils and damned spirits;
				   and therefore are ready to say with themselves, How do I know that
				   there is any such thing as another world? When the beasts die, there is
				   an end of them, and how do I know but that it will be so with me?
				   Perhaps all these things are nothing but the inventions of men, nothing
				   but cunningly devised fables.
				</p><p>
				   Such thoughts are apt to rise in the minds of sinners, and the devil
				   sets in to enforce them. Such thoughts are an ease to them; therefore
				   they wish they were true, and that makes them the more ready to think
				   that they are indeed true. So that they are hardened in the way of sin,
				   by infidelity and atheistical thoughts. Psalm xiv. 1. " The fool hath
				   said in his heart, There is no God." Psalm xciv. 6, 7. "They slay the
				   widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, the
				   Lord shall not see; neither shall the God of Jacob regard it,"
				</p><p>
				   2. Some flatter themselves that death is a great way off, and that they
				   shall hereafter have much opportunity to seek salvation; and they think
				   if they earnestly seek it, though it be a great while hence, they shall
				   obtain. Although they see no reason to conclude that they shall live
				   long, and perhaps they do not positively conclude that they shall; yet
				   it doth not come into their minds that their lives are really
				   uncertain, and that it is doubtful whether they will live another year.
				   Such a thought as this doth not take any hold of them. And although
				   they do not absolutely determine that they shall live to old age or to
				   middle age, yet they secretly flatter themselves with such an
				   imagination. They are disposed to believe so, and do so far believe it,
				   that they act upon it and run the venture of it.
				</p><p>
				   Men will believe that things will be as they choose to have them,
				   without reason, and sometimes without the appearance of reason, as is
				   most apparent in this case, Psalm xlix. 11. "Their inward thought is,
				   that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to
				   all generations; they call their lands after their own names."
				</p><p>
				   The prepossession and desire of men to have it so, is the principal
				   thing that makes them believe so. However, there are several other
				   things which they use as arguments to flatter themselves. Perhaps they
				   think with themselves, that since they are at present in health, or in
				   youth, or that since they are useful men, do a great deal of good, and
				   both them selves and others pray for the continuance of their lives;
				   they are not likely to be removed by death very soon.
				</p><p>
				   If they shall live many years in the world, they think that it is very
				   probable they shall be converted before they die; as they expect
				   hereafter to have much more convenient opportunities to become
				   converted, than they have now. And by some means or other, they think
				   they shall get through their work before they arrive at old age.
				</p><p>
				   3. Some flatter themselves that they lead moral and orderly lives, and
				   therefore think that they shall not be damned. They think with
				   themselves that they live not in any vice, that they take care to wrong
				   no man, are just and honest dealers, that they are not addicted to hard
				   drinking, or to uncleanness, or to bad language; that they keep the
				   Sabbath strictly, are constant attendants on the public worship, and
				   maintain the worship of God in their families. Therefore they hope that
				   God will not cast them into hell. They see not why God should be so
				   angry with them as that would imply, seeing they are so orderly and
				   regular in their walk; they see not that they have done enough to anger
				   him to that degree. And if they have angered him, they imagine they
				   have also done a great deal to pacify him.
				</p><p>
				   If they be not as yet converted, and it be necessary that they should
				   experience any other conversion in order to their salvation, they hope
				   that their orderly and strict lives will move God to give them
				   converting grace. They hope that surely God will not see those that
				   live as they do go to hell. Thus they flatter themselves, as those we
				   read of. Luke xviii. 9. "That trusted in themselves that they were
				   righteous."
				</p><p>
				   4. Some make the advantages under which they live an occasion of self
				   flattery. They flatter themselves, because they live in a place where
				   the gospel is powerfully preached and among a religious people, where
				   many have been converted; and they think it will be much easier for
				   them to be saved on that account. Thus they abuse the grace of God to
				   their destruction; they do that which the scriptures call despising the
				   riches of God's goodness: Romans ii. 4. "Or despisest thou the riches
				   of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering; not knowing that
				   the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?"
				</p><p>
				   Some flatter themselves, because they are born of godly parents, who
				   are dear to God, who have often and earnestly prayed for them, they
				   hope that their prayers will be heard; and that encourages them to go
				   on in the way of neglecting their souls. The Jews had great dependence
				   upon this, that they were the children of Abraham: John viii. 33. they
				   make their boast. "We be Abraham's seed; and in verse 39. "Abraham is
				   our father."
				</p><p>
				   5. Some flatter themselves with their own intentions. They intend to
				   neglect themselves, and give themselves liberty for a while longer, and
				   then to reform. Though now they neglect their souls, and are going on
				   in sin; yet they intend ere long to bestir themselves, to leave off
				   their sins, and to set themselves to seek God. They hear that there is
				   great encouragement for those who earnestly seek God, that they shall
				   find him. So they intend to do; they propose to seek with a great deal
				   of earnestness. They are told, that there are many who seek to enter
				   the kingdom of heaven, who shall not be able; but they intend, not only
				   to seek, but To STRIVE However, for the present they allow themselves
				   in their ease, sloth, and pleasure, minding only earthly things.
				</p><p>
				   Or if they should be seized with some mortal distemper, and should draw
				   near to the grave, before the time which they lay out in their minds
				   for reformation, they think how earnestly they would pray and cry to
				   God for mercy; and as they hear God is a merciful God, who taketh no
				   delight in the death of sinners, they hence flatter themselves that
				   they shall move God to have pity on them.
				</p><p>
				   There are but few who are sinners, and know themselves to be such, who
				   do not encourage themselves with intentions of future repentance and
				   reformation; but few who do not flatter themselves, that they shall in
				   good earnest set themselves to seek God some time or other. Hell is
				   full of GOOD INTENDERS who never proved to be TRUE PERFORMERS: Acts
				   xxiv. 25. "Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I
				   will call for thee."
				</p><p>
				   6. There are some who flatter themselves, that they do and have done, a
				   great deal for their salvation, and therefore hope they shall obtain,
				   when indeed they neither do what they ought to do, nor what they might
				   do in their present state of unregeneracy; nor are they in any likely
				   way to be converted They think they are striving, when they neglect
				   many moral and some instituted duties; nor do they exert themselves as
				   if it were for their lives; they are not violent for the kingdom of
				   leaven.
				</p><p>
				   There are doubtless many such; many are concerned, and are seeking, and
				   do many things, and think that they are in a very fair way to obtain
				   the kingdom of God; yet there is great danger that thy will prove at
				   last to be some of the foolish virgins, and be found without oil in
				   their vessels.
				</p><p>
				   7. Some hope by their strivings to obtain salvation of themselves. They
				   have a secret imagination, that they shall, by degrees, work in
				   themselves sorrow and repentance of sin, and love towards God and Jesus
				   Christ. Their striving is not so much an earnest seeking to God, as a
				   striving to do them selves that which is the work of God. Many who are
				   now seeking have this imagination, and labor, reach, pray, hear sermons
				   and go to private meetings, with the view of making themselves holy,
				   and of working in themselves holy affections.
				</p><p>
				   Many, who only project and design to turn to God hereafter, are apt to
				   think that it is an easy thing to be converted, that it is a thing
				   which will be in their own power at any time, when they shall earnestly
				   set themselves to it.
				</p><p>
				   8. Some sinners flatter themselves that they are already converted.
				   They sit down and rest in a false hope, persuading themselves that all
				   their sins are pardoned; that God loves them; that they shall go to
				   heaven when they die; and that they need trouble themselves no more:
				   Revelation iii. 17. "Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with
				   goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art
				   wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."
				</p><p>
				   III. Sinners very generally go on flattering themselves in some or
				   other of these ways, till their punishment actually overtakes them.
				   These are the baits by which Satan catches souls, and draws them into
				   his snare. They are such self flatteries as these that keep men from
				   seeing what danger they are in, and that make them go securely on in
				   the way they are in, "as the bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not
				   that it is for his life."
				</p><p>
				   Those that flatter themselves with hopes of living a great while longer
				   in the world, very commonly continue so to do till death comes. Death
				   comes upon them when they expect it not; they look upon it as a great
				   way off, when there is but a step between them and death. They thought
				   not of dying at that time, nor at anytime near it. When they were
				   young, they proposed to live a good while longer; and if they happen to
				   live till middle age, they still maintain the same thought, that they
				   are not yet near death; and so that thought goes along with them as
				   long as they live, or till they are just about to die.
				</p><p>
				   Men often have a dependence on their own righteousness, and as long as
				   they live are never brought off from it. Multitudes uphold themselves
				   with their own intentions, till all their prospects are dashed in
				   pieces by death. They put off the work which they have to do till such
				   a time; and when that comes, they put it off to another time, until
				   death, which cannot be put off, overtakes them. There are many also
				   that hold a false hope, a persuasion that they belong to God; and as
				   long as they live, by all the marks and signs which are given of a true
				   convert, they never will be persuaded to let go their hope, till it is
				   rent from them by death.
				</p><p>
				   Thus men commonly uphold themselves, and make themselves easy, till
				   hell fire makes them uneasy. Everlasting ruin comes upon them as a
				   snare, and all their hopes are at once cut off, and turned into
				   everlasting despair: I. Thessalonians v. 3. "When they shall say, Peace
				   and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
				   woman with child; and they shall not escape."
				</p><p>
				<hi type="bold">Application</hi>
				</p><p>
				   1. Hence we learn one reason why there are but few saved, and why so
				   many perish from under the gospel. All men know that they must die, and
				   all that sit under the light of the gospel have been told many a time,
				   that after this there is an other world; that there are but two states
				   in that other world, a state of eternal happiness, and a state of
				   eternal misery; that there is but one way of escaping the misery and
				   obtaining the blessedness of eternity, which is by obtaining an
				   interest in Christ, through faith in him; and that this life is the
				   only opportunity of obtaining an interest in Christ. Yet men are so
				   much given to flatter themselves in those ways which we have mentioned,
				   that there are but few that seasonably take care of their salvation.
				   Indeed they cannot but be in some measure concerned about their souls;
				   yet they flatter themselves with one thing or other, so that they are
				   kept steadily and uninterruptedly going on in the broad way to
				   destruction.
				</p><p>
				   2. Hence we learn the reason why awakening truths of scripture, and
				   awakening sermons, make no more impression upon men. It is in itself a
				   wonderful and surprising thing, that God's denunciations of eternal
				   misery, and threatenings of casting sinners into the lake that burneth
				   with fire and brimstone for ever and ever, do not affect them, do not
				   startle them. But the truth is, they flatter themselves, by such means
				   as we have mentioned, that this dreadful misery is not for them; that
				   they shall escape it, though multitudes of others are involved in it.
				   They take not these threatenings to themselves; they seem to think that
				   they do not belong to them.
				</p><p>
				   How many are there in this congregation, who, for all the awakening
				   sermons they have heard, are yet secure in sin! And who, although they
				   are sensible that they are in a Christless condition, and are still
				   going on in sin, yet intend to go to heaven, and expect that by some
				   means or other they shall arrive there. They are often told, that God
				   is very angry with them; yet they think God is a very merciful God, and
				   they shall be able to pacify him. If they be told how uncertain life
				   is, that doth not awaken them, because they flatter themselves with
				   long life. If they be told how dangerous it is to delay the business of
				   religion, they promise themselves, that they will hereafter engage in
				   it with more earnestness than others, and so obtain the end, the
				   salvation of their souls. Others, when they are told that many shall
				   seek who shall not he able to obtain, think surely, that they, having
				   done so much for salvation, shall not be denied.
				</p><p>
				   3. Let every sinner examine himself, whether he do not flatter himself
				   in some of those ways which have been mentioned. What is it in your own
				   minds which makes you think it is safe for you to delay turning to God?
				   What is it that encourages you to run such a venture as you do by
				   delaying this necessary work? Is it that you hope there is no such
				   state as heaven or hell, and have a suspicion that there is no God ? Is
				   It this that makes you secure ? Or is it that you are not much afraid
				   but that you shall have opportunity enough a great while hence to mind
				   such things? Is it an intention of a future seeking a more convenient
				   season? And are you persuaded that God will hearken to you then, after
				   you shall have so long turned a deaf ear to his commands and gracious?
				   Are you encouraged to commit sin, because you hope to repent of it? Are
				   you encouraged by the mercy of God to be his enemies? And do you
				   resolve still to provoke him to anger, because you think he is easily
				   pacified ?
				</p><p>
				   Or do you think that your conversion is in your own power, and that you
				   can turn to God when you please? Is it because you have been born of
				   godly parents that you are so secure? Or do you imagine that you are in
				   a fair way to be converted? Do you think that what you have done in
				   religion will engage God to pity you, and that he never can have the
				   heart to condemn one who has lived in so orderly a manner? Or do you
				   think that you are indeed converted already? And doth that encourage
				   you to take a liberty in sinning ? Or are you secure, because you are
				   so stupid as to think nothing about these things? Do you let these
				   concerns wholly alone, and scarcely ever think at all how it will be
				   with you after you are dead?
				</p><p>
				   Certainly it must be one or more of these things which keeps you in
				   your security, and encourages you to go on in sin. Examine, therefore,
				   and see which of them it is.
				</p><p>
				   4. By the text and doctrine be persuaded to leave off thus flattering
				   yourselves in your own eyes. You are therein informed, that those who
				   do as you do commonly continue so doing till their punishment actually
				   comes upon them. Thereby you may be convinced of the vanity of all such
				   flatteries. Be afraid of that which you are sure is the devil's bait:
				   "Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird," Proverbs
				   i. 17.
				</p><p>
				   You are not only told in the scriptures, that sinners are generally
				   thus allured to hell, but your own reason may convince you that it is
				   so. For doubtless other sinners have as much ground to hope to escape
				   punishment as you; and it is evident, that they generally do hope to
				   escape. Men under the gospel almost universally think they shall not go
				   to hell: If it were otherwise, they could have no peace or comfort in
				   the world. Yet what multitudes have we reason to conclude go down from
				   under the preaching of the gospel to the pit of destruction! Now, this
				   is surely enough to convince any sober, prudent person of the folly of
				   such flattery, and of the folly of every one that doth not immediately
				   set about his great work with his might. If you could have access to
				   the damned, you would hear many of them curse themselves, for thus
				   flattering themselves while they lived in this world; and you would
				   have the same doctrine preached to you by their wailings and yellings
				   which is now preached to you from the pulpit.
				</p><p>
				   If your temptation to security be unbelief of the fundamental doctrines
				   of religion, such as the being of God, of another world, and an eternal
				   judgment, you may consider, that though that makes you secure at
				   present, yet it will not do always, it will not stand by when you come
				   to die. The fool often in health saith, There is no God; but when he
				   comes to die, he cannot rest in any such supposition. Then he is
				   generally so much convinced in his own conscience, that there is a God,
				   that he is in dreadful amazement for fear of his eternal wrath. It is
				   folly, therefore, to flatter yourselves with any supposition now which
				   you will not then be able to hold.
				</p><p>
				   If you depend on long life, consider how many who have depended on the
				   same thing, and had as much reason to depend on it as you, have died
				   within your remembrance.
				</p><p>
				   Is it because you are outwardly of an orderly life and conversation,
				   that you think you shall be saved ? How unreasonable is it to suppose,
				   that God should be so obliged by those actions, which he knows are not
				   done from the least respect or regard to him, but wholly with a private
				   view! Is it because you are under great advantages that you are not
				   much afraid but that you shall some time or other be converted, and
				   therefore neglect yourselves and your spiritual interests? And were not
				   the people of Bethsaida, Chorazin and Capernaum, under as great
				   advantages as you, when Christ himself preached the gospel to them,
				   almost continually, and wrought such a multitude of miracles among
				   them? Yet he says, that it shall be more tolerable in the day of
				   judgment for Sodom and Gomorrah, than for those cities.
				</p><p>
				   Do you expect you shall be saved, however you neglect yourselves,
				   because you were born of godly parents? hear what Christ saith, Matthew
				   iii. 9. ''Think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our
				   father." Do you flatter yourselves that you shall obtain mercy, though
				   others do not, because you intend hereafter to seek it more earnestly
				   than others? Yet you deceive yourselves, if you think that you intend
				   better than many of those others, or better than many who are now in
				   hell once intended.
				</p><p>
				   If you think you are in a way of earnest seeking, consider, whether or
				   no you do not mind other things yet more? If you imagine that you have
				   it in your own power to work yourselves up to repentance, consider,
				   that you must assuredly give up that imagination before you can have
				   repentance wrought in you. If you think yourselves already converted,
				   and that encourages you to give yourselves the greater liberty in
				   sinning, this is a certain sign that you are not converted.
				</p><p>
				   Wherefore abandon all these ways of flattering yourselves; no longer
				   follow the devil's bait; and let nothing encourage you to go on in sin;
				   but immediately and henceforth seek God with all your heart, and soul,
				   and strength.

				<title>THE FUTURE PUNISHMENT OF THE WICKED	UNAVOIDABLE AND INTOLERABLE</title>
				<p>				
				    <reference osisRef="Ezek.22.14">Ezekiel 22:14</reference> : Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong in the
				    days that I shall deal with thee? I the Lord save spoken it, and will do it.
				</p><p>
				   IN the former part of this chapter, we have a dreadful catalogue of the
				   sins of Jerusalem; as you may see from the first to the thirteenth
				   verse. In the thirteenth, which is the verse preceeding the text, God
				   manifests his great displeasure and fearful wrath against them for
				   those their iniquities. "Behold, I have smitten mine hand at thy
				   dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been
				   in the midst of thee." The expression of God's smiting his hand,
				   signifies the greatness of his anger, and his preparing himself, as it
				   were to execute wrath answerable to their heinous crimes. It is an
				   allusion to what we sometimes see in men when they are surprised, by
				   seeing or hearing of some horrid offence, or most intolerable injury,
				   which very much stirs their spirits, and animates them with high
				   resentment; on such an occasion they will rise up in wrath and smite
				   their hands together, as an expression of the heat of their
				   indignation, and full resolution to be avenged on those who have
				   committed the injury; as in chap. xxi. 7. " I will also smite mine
				   hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the Lord have said
				   it,"
				</p><p>
				   Then, in the text, the punishment of that people is represented.
				</p><p>
				   1. The nature of their punishment is more generally represented in that
				   therein God will undertake to deal with them: God here threatens to
				   deal with the sinners in Jerusalem. The prophets could do nothing with
				   them. God had sent them one after another; but those sinners were too
				   strong for them, and beat one, and killed another. Therefore now God
				   himself undertakes to deal with them.
				</p><p>
				   2. Their punishment is more particularly represented in three things,
				   viz. The intolerableness, the remedilessness, and the unavoidableness
				   of it.
				</p><p>
				   (1.) The intolerableness of it: Can thine heart endure?
				</p><p>
				   (2.) The remedilessness, or the impossibility of their doing any thing
				   for their own relief: Can thine hands be strong?
				</p><p>
				   (3.) The unavoidableness of it: I the Lord have spoken it, and will do
				   it.
				</p><p>
				<hi type="bold">Doctrine</hi>
				</p><p>
				   Since God hath undertaken to deal with impenitent sinners, they shall
				   neither shun the threatened misery, nor deliver themselves out of it,
				   nor can they bear it.
				</p><p>
				   In handling this doctrine, I shall,
				</p><p>
				   1. Show what is implied in God's undertaking to deal with inpenitent
				   sinners.
				</p><p>
				   2. That therefore they cannot avoid punishment.
				</p><p>
				   3. That they cannot in any measure deliver themselves from it, or do
				   any thing for their own relief under it.
				</p><p>
				   4. That they cannot bear it.
				</p><p>
				   5. I shall answer an inquiry; and then proceed to the use.
				</p><p>
				   I. I shall show what is implied in God's undertaking to deal with
				   impenitent sinners...Others are not able to deal with them. They baffle
				   all the means used with them by those that are appointed to teach and
				   to rule over them. They will not yield to parents, or to the counsels,
				   warning, or reproofs of ministers. They prove obstinate and
				   stiff-hearted. Therefore God undertakes to deal with them This implies
				   the following things:
				</p><p>
				   1. That God will reckon with them, and take of them satisfaction to his
				   justice. In this world God puts forth his authority to command them;
				   and to require subjection to him. In his commands he is very positive,
				   strictly requiring of them the performance of such and such duties, and
				   as positively forbidding such and such things which were contrary to
				   their duty. But they have no regard to these commands. God continues
				   commanding, and they continue rebelling. They make nothing of God's
				   authority. God threatens, but they despise his threatening They make
				   nothing of dishonoring God; they care not how much their behavior is to
				   the dishonor of God. He offers them mercy, if they will repent and
				   return; but they despise his mercy as well as his wrath. God calleth,
				   but they refuse. Thus they are continually plunging themselves deeper
				   and deeper in debt, and at the same time imagine they shall escape the
				   payment of the debt, and design entirely to rob God of his due.
				</p><p>
				   But God hath undertaken to right himself. He will reckon with them; he
				   hath undertaken to see that the debts due to him are paid. All their
				   sins are written in his book; not one of them is forgotten, and every
				   one must be paid. If God be wise enough, and strong enough, he will
				   have full satisfaction: he will exact the very uttermost farthing. He
				   undertakes it as his part, as what belongs to him, to see himself
				   righted, wherein he hath been wronged Deut. xxii. 35. "To me belongeth
				   vengeance." Ibid. vii. 10. "He will not be slack to him that hateth
				   him; he will repay him to his face."
				</p><p>
				   2. He hath undertaken to vindicate the honor of his Majesty. His
				   Majesty they despise. They hear that he is a great God; but they
				   despise his greatness; they look upon him worthy of contempt, and treat
				   him accordingly. They hear of him by the name of a great King; but his
				   authority they regard not, and sometimes trample upon it for years
				   together. But God hath not left the honor of his Majesty wholly to
				   their care. Though they now trample it in the dust, yet that is no sign
				   that it will finally be lost. If God had left it wholly in their hands,
				   it would indeed be lost. But God doth not leave his honor and his glory
				   with his enemies; it is too precious in his eyes to be so neglected. He
				   hath reserved the care of it to himself: He will see to it that his own
				   injured Majesty is vindicated. If the honor of God, upon which sinners
				   trample, finally lie in the dust, then it will be because he is not
				   strong enough to vindicate himself. He hath sworn that great oath in
				   Numbers xiv. 2 1. "As truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled
				   with the glory of the Lord."
				</p><p>
				   Sinners despise his Son, and trample him under their feet. But he will
				   see, if he cannot make the glory of his Son appear, with respect to
				   them; that all the earth may know how evil a thing it is to despise the
				   Son of God. God intends that all men and angels, all heaven and all
				   earth, shall see whether he be sufficient to magnify himself upon
				   sinners who now despise him. He intends that the issue of things with
				   respect to them shall be open, that all men may see it.
				</p><p>
				   3. He hath undertaken to subdue impenitent sinners. Their hearts while
				   in this world are very unsubdued. They lift up their heads and conduct
				   themselves very proudly and contemptuously, and often sin with an high
				   hand. They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues walk
				   through the earth. They practically say as Pharaoh did, "Who is the
				   Lord? I know not the Lord, neither will I obey his voice." Job xxi. 4
				   1. "They say to God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of
				   thy ways."
				</p><p>
				   Some, who cover their sin with specious show, who put on a face of
				   religion, and a demure countenance and behavior, yet have this spirit
				   secretly reigning in their breasts. Notwithstanding all their fair
				   show, and good external carriage, they despise God in their hearts, and
				   have the weapons of war about them, though they are secret enemies, and
				   carry their swords under their skirts. They have most proud, stubborn,
				   and rebellious hearts, which are ready to rise in opposition, to
				   contend with him, and to find fault with his dispensations. Their
				   hearts are full of pride, enmity, stubbornness, and blasphemy, which
				   work in them many ways, while they sit under the preaching of the word,
				   and while the spirit of God is striving with them; and they always
				   continue to oppose and resist God as long as they live in the world;
				   they never lay down the weapons of their rebellion."
				</p><p>
				   But God hath undertaken to deal with them and to subdue them; and those
				   proud and stubborn hearts, which will not yield to the power of God's
				   word, shall be broken by the power of his hand. If they will not be
				   willing subjects to the golden sceptre, and will not yield to the
				   attractives of his love, they shall be subject to the force of the iron
				   rod, whether they will or no.
				</p><p>
				   Them that proudly set up their own righteousness, and their own wills
				   against God, God hath undertaken to bring down; and without doubt, it
				   will be done. He hath undertaken to make those who are now regardless
				   of God, regard him. They shall know that he is Jehovah. Now they will
				   not own that he is the Lord; but they shall know it, Isa. xxvi. 11.
				   "Lord, when thine hand is lifted up, they will not see: But they shall
				   see."
				</p><p>
				   Now wicked men not only hate God, but they slight him; they are not
				   afraid of him. But, he will subdue their contempt. When he shall come
				   to take them in hand, they will hate him still; but they will not
				   slight him; they will not make light of his power as they now do; they
				   will see and feel too much of the infinity of his power to slight it
				   They are now wont to slight his wrath; but then they will slight it no
				   more, they will be infinitely far from it, they will find by sufficient
				   experience that his wrath is not to be slighted: They will learn this
				   to their cost, and they never will forget it.
				</p><p>
				   4. God hath undertaken to rectify their judgments. Now they will not be
				   convinced of those things which God tells them in his word. Ministers
				   take much pains to convince them, but all is in vain. Therefore God
				   will undertake to convince them, and he will do it effectually. Now
				   they will not be convinced of the truth of divine things. They have
				   indeed convincing arguments set before them; they hear and see enough
				   to convince them; yet so prone are they to unbelief and Atheism, that
				   divine things never seem to them to be real. But God will hereafter
				   make them seem real.
				</p><p>
				   Now they are always doubting of the truth of the Scriptures,
				   questioning whether they be the word of God, and whether the
				   threatenings of Scripture be true. but God hath undertaken to convince
				   them that those threatenings are true, and he will make them to know
				   that they are true, so that they will never doubt any more for ever.
				   They will be convinced by dear experience....Now they are always
				   questioning whether there be any such place as hell. They hear much
				   about it, but it always seems to them like a dream. But God will make
				   it seem otherwise than a dream....Now they are often told of the vanity
				   of the world; but we may as well preach to the beasts, to persuade them
				   of the vanity of earthly things. But God will undertake to convince
				   them of this; he will hereafter give them a thorough conviction of it,
				   so that they shall have a strong sense of the vanity of all these
				   things.
				</p><p>
				   Now ministers often tell sinners of the great importance of an interest
				   in Christ, and that that is the one thing needful. They are also told
				   the folly of delaying the care of their souls, and how much it concerns
				   them to improve their opportunity. But the instructions of ministers do
				   not convince them, therefore God will undertake to convince them.
				   Impenitent sinners, while in this world, hear how dreadful hell is. But
				   they will not believe that it is so dreadful as ministers represent.
				   They cannot think that they shall to all eternity suffer such exquisite
				   and horrible torments. But they shall be taught and convinced to
				   purpose, that the representations ministers give of those torments,
				   agreeable to the word of God, are no bugbears; and that the wrath of
				   God is indeed as dreadful as they declare. Since God hath undertaken to
				   deal with sinners, and to rectify their judgments in these matters, and
				   he will do it thoroughly; for his work is perfect; when he undertakes
				   to do things, he doth not do them by halves; therefore before he shall
				   have done with sinners, be will convince them effectually, so that they
				   shall never be in danger of relapsing into their former errors any
				   more. He will convince them of their folly and stupidity in
				   entertaining such notions as they now entertain.
				</p><p>
				   Thus God hath undertaken to deal with obstinate unbelievers. They carry
				   things on in great confusion; but we need not be dismayed at it: Let us
				   wait, and we shall see that God will rectify things. Sinners will not
				   always continue to rebel and despise with impunity. The honor of God
				   will in due time be vindicated; and they shall be subdued and
				   convicted, and shall give an account. There is no sin, not so much as
				   an idle word that they shall speak, but they must give an account of
				   it; Matth. xii 36. And their sins must be fully balanced, and
				   recompensed, and satisfaction obtained. Because judgment against their
				   evil works is not speedily executed, their hearts are fully set in them
				   to do evil. Yet God is a righteous judge; he will see that judgment is
				   executed in due time.
				</p><p>
				   I come now,
				</p><p>
				   II. To show, that therefore impenitent sinners shall not avoid their
				   due punishment....God hath undertaken to inflict it; he hath engaged to
				   do it; he takes it as his work, as what properly belongs to him, and we
				   may expect it of him. If he hath sworn by his life, that he will do it;
				   and if he hath power sufficient; if he is the living God, doubtless we
				   shall see it done. And that God hath declared that he will punish
				   impenitent sinners, is manifest from, many scriptures; as Deut.
				   xxxii.41. "I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward
				   them that hate me." Deut. vii. 10. "He will not be slack to him that
				   hateth him: He will repay him to his face." Exod. xxxiv. 7. "That will
				   by no means clear the guilty." Nahum i. 3. "The Lord is slow to anger,
				   and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked."
				   God saith in the text, "I the Lord hath spoken it, and will do it;"
				   which leaves no room to doubt of the actual fulfilment of the
				   threatening in its utmost extent....Some wicked men have flattered
				   themselves, that although God hath threatened very dreadful things to
				   wicked men for their sins, yet in his heart he never intends to fulfil
				   his threatenings, but only to terrify them, and make them afraid, while
				   they live. But would the infinitely holy God, who is not a man that he
				   should lie, and who speaketh no vain words, utter himself in this
				   manner: I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it; I have not only
				   threatened, but I will also fufill my threatenings; when at the same
				   time these words did not agree with his heart, but he secretly knew
				   that though he had spoken, yet he intended not to do it? Who is he that
				   dares to entertain such horrid blasphemy in his heart?
				</p><p>
				   No; let no impenitent sinner flatter himself so vainly and foolishly.
				   If it were indeed only a man, a being of like impotency and mutability
				   with themselves, who had undertaken to deal with them; they might
				   perhaps with some reason flatter themselves; that they should find some
				   means to avoid the threatened punishment. But since an omniscient,
				   omnipotent, immutable God hath undertaken, vain are all such hopes.
				</p><p>
				   There is no hope that possibly they may steal away to heaven, though
				   they die unconverted. There is no hope that they can deceive God by any
				   false show of repentance and faith, and so be taken to heaven through
				   mistake; for the eyes of God are as a flame of fire; they perfectly see
				   through every man; the inmost closet of the heart is all open to him
				</p><p>
				   There is no hope of escaping the threatened punishment by sinking into
				   nothing at death, like brute creatures Indeed, many wicked men upon
				   their deathbeds wish for this. If it were so, death would be nothing to
				   them in comparison with what it now is. But all such wishes are vain.
				</p><p>
				   There is no hope of their escaping without notice, when they leave the
				   body. There is no hope that God, by reason of the multiplicity of
				   affairs which ho hath to mind, will happen to overlook them, and not
				   take notice of them, when they come to die; and so that their souls
				   will slip away privately, and hide themselves in some secret corner,
				   and so escape divine vengeance.
				</p><p>
				   There is no hope that they shall be missed in a crowd at the day of
				   judgment, and that they can have opportunity to hide themselves in some
				   cave or den of the mountains, or in any secret hole of the earth; and
				   that while so doing, they will not be minded, by reason of the many
				   things which will be the objects of attention on that day....Neither is
				   there any hope that they will be able to crowd themselves in among the
				   multitude of the saints at the right hand of the Judge, and so go to
				   heaven undiscovered....Nor is there any hope that God will alter his
				   mind, or that he will repent of what he hath said; for he is not the
				   son of man that lie should repent. Hath he said, and shall he not do
				   it? Hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? When did God ever
				   undertake to do any thing and fail?
				</p><p>
				   I come now,
				</p><p>
				   III. To show, that as impenitent sinners cannot shun the threatened
				   punishment; so neither can they do any thing to deliver themselves from
				   it, or to relieve themselves under it. This is implied in those words
				   of the text, Can thine hand. be strong? It is with our hands that we
				   make and accomplish things for ourselves. But the wicked in hell will
				   have no strength of hand to accomplish any thing at all for themselves,
				   or to bring to pass any deliverance, or any degree of relief.
				</p><p>
				   1. They will not he able in that conflict to overcome their enemy, and
				   so to deliver themselves. God, who will then undertake to deal with
				   them, and will gird himself with might to execute wrath, will be their
				   enemy, and will act the part of an enemy with a witness; and they will
				   have no strength to oppose him. Those who live negligent of their souls
				   under the light of the gospel, act as if they supposed, that they
				   should be able here after to make their part good with God. 1 Cor. x.
				   22. "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he
				   ?"...But they will have no power, no might to resist that omnipotence,
				   which will be engaged against them.
				</p><p>
				   2. They will have no strength in their hands to do any thing to appease
				   God, or in the least to abate the fierceness of his wrath. They will
				   not be able to offer any satisfaction: they will not be able to procure
				   God's pity. Though they cry, God will not hear them. They will find no
				   price to offer to God, in order to purchase any favor, or to pay any
				   part of their debt.
				</p><p>
				   3. They will not be able to find any to befriend them, and intercede
				   with God for them. They had the offer of a mediator often made them in
				   this world; but they will have no offers of such a nature in hell. None
				   will befriend them. They will have no friend in HELL; all there will be
				   their enemies. They will have no friend in heaven: 'None of the saints
				   or angels will befriend them; or if they should, it would be to no
				   purpose. There will be no creature that will have any power to dellver
				   them, nor will any ever pity them.
				</p><p>
				   4. Nor will they ever be able to make their escape. They will find no
				   means to break prison and flee. In hell, they will be reserved in
				   chains of darkness for ever and ever. Malefactors have often found
				   means to break prison, and escape the hand of, civil justice. But none
				   ever escaped out of the prison of hell, which is God's prison. It is a
				   strong prison: it is beyond any finite power, or the united strength of
				   all wicked men and devils, to unlock, or break open the door of that
				   prison. Christ hath the key of hell; "he shuts and no man opens."
				</p><p>
				   5. Nor will they ever be able to find any thing to relieve them in
				   hell. They will never find any resting place there; any place of
				   respite; any secret corner, which will be cooler than the rest, where
				   they may have a little respite, a small abatement of the extremity of
				   their torment. They never will be able to find any cooling stream or
				   fountain, in any part of that world of torment; no, nor so much as a
				   drop of water to cool their tongues. They will find no company to give
				   them any comfort, or to do them the least good. They will find no
				   place, where they can remain, and rest, and take breath for one minute:
				   For they will be tormented with fire and brimstone; and will have no
				   rest day nor night for ever and ever.
				</p><p>
				   Thus impenitent sinners will be able neither to shun the punishment
				   threatened, nor to deliver themselves from it, nor to find any relief
				   under it.
				</p><p>
				   I come now,
				</p><p>
				   IV. To show, that neither will they be able to bear it. Neither will
				   their bands be strong to deliver t}themselves from it, nor will their
				   hearts be able to endure it. It is common with men, when they meet with
				   calamities in this world, in the first place to endeavor to shun them.
				   But if they find, that they cannot shun them, then after they are come,
				   they endeavor to deliver themselves from them as soon as they can; or
				   at least, to order things so, as to deliver themselves in some degree.
				   But if they find that they can by no means deliver themselves, and see
				   that the case is so that they must bear them; then they set themselves
				   to bear them: they fortify their spirits, and take up a resolution,
				   that they will support themselves under them as well as they can.
				</p><p>
				   But it will be utterly in vain for impenitent sinners to think to do
				   thus with respect to the torments of hell. They will not be able to
				   endure them, or at all to support themselves under them: the torment
				   will be immensely beyond their strength. What will it signify for a
				   worm, which is about to be pressed under the weight of some great rock,
				   to be let fall with its whole weight upon it, to collect its strength,
				   to set itself to bear up the weight of the rock, and to preserve itself
				   from being crushed by it? Much more in vain will it be for a poor
				   damned soul, to endeavor to support itself under the weight of the
				   wrath of Almighty God. What is the strength of man, who is but a worm,
				   to support himself against the power of Jehovah, and against the
				   fierceness of his wrath? What is man's strength, when set to bear up
				   against the exertions of infinite power? Matt. xxi. 44, "Whosoever
				   shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall
				   fall, it will grind him to powder."
				</p><p>
				   When sinners hear of hell torments, they sometimes think with
				   themselves: Well, if it shall come to that, that I must go to hell, I
				   will bear it as well as I can: as if by clothing themselves with
				   resolution and firmness of mind, they would be able to support
				   themselves in some measure; when, alas! they will have no resolution,
				   no courage at all. However they shall have prepared themselves, and
				   collected their strength; yet as soon as they shall begin to feel that
				   wrath, their hearts will melt and be as water. However before they may
				   seem to harden their hearts, in order to prepare themselves to bear,
				   yet the first moment they feel it, their hearts will become like wax
				   before the furnace. Their courage and resolution will be all gone in an
				   instant; it will vanish away like a shadow in the twinkling of an eye.
				   The stoutest and most sturdy will have no more courage than the
				   feeblest infant: let a man be an infant, or a giant, it will be all
				   one. They will not be able to keep alive any courage, any strength, any
				   comfort, any hope at all.
				</p><p>
				   I come now as was proposed,
				</p><p>
				   V. To answer an inquiry which may naturally be raised concerning these
				   things.
				</p><p>
				   Inquiry. Some may be ready to say, If this be the case, if impenitent
				   sinners can neither shun future punishment, nor deliver themselves from
				   it, nor bear it; then what will become of them?
				</p><p>
				   Answer. They will wholly sink down into eternal death. There will be
				   that sinking of heart, of which we now cannot conceive. We see how it
				   is with the body when in extreme pain. The nature of the body will
				   support itself for a considerable time under very great pain, so as to
				   keep from wholly sinking. There will be great struggles, lamentable
				   groans and panting, and it may be convulsions. These are the
				   strugglings of nature to support itself under the extremity of the
				   pain. There is, as it were, a great lothness in nature to yield to it;
				   it cannot bear wholly to sink.
				</p><p>
				   But yet sometimes pain of body is so very extreme and exquisite, that
				   the nature of the body cannot support itself under it; however loth it
				   may be to sink, yet it cannot bear the pain; there are a few struggles,
				   and throes, and pantings, and it may be a shriek or two, and then
				   nature yields to the violence of the torments, sinks down, and the body
				   dies. This is the death of the body. So it will be with the soul in
				   hell; it will have no strength or power to deliver itself and its
				   torment and horror will be so great, so mighty, so vastly
				   disproportioned to its strength, that having no strength in the least
				   to support itself, although it be infinitely contrary to the nature and
				   inclination of the soul utterly to sink; yet it will sink, it will
				   utterly and totally sink, without the least degree of remaining
				   comfort, or strength, or courage, or hope. And though it will never be
				   annihilated, its being and perception will never be abolished, yet such
				   will be the infinite depth of gloominess that it will sink into, that
				   it will be in a state of death, eternal death.
				</p><p>
				   The nature of man desires happiness; it is the nature of the soul to
				   crave and thirst after well-being; and if it be under misery, it
				   eagerly pants after relief; and the greater the misery is, the more
				   eagerly doth it struggle for help. But if all relief be withholden, all
				   strength overborne, all support utterly gone; then it sinks into the
				   darkness of death.
				</p><p>
				   We can conceive but little of the matter; we cannot conceive what that
				   sinking of the soul in such a case is. But to help your conception,
				   imagine yourself to be cast into a fiery oven, or of a great furnace,
				   where your pain would be as much greater than that occasioned by
				   accidentally touching a coal of fire, as the heat is greater. Imagine
				   also that your body were to lie there for a quarter of an hour, all the
				   while full of quick sense; what horror would you feel at the entrance
				   of such a furnace! And how long would that quarter of an hour seem to
				   you! And after you had endured it for one minute, how overbearing would
				   it be to you to think that you had it to endure the other fourteen!
				</p><p>
				   But what would be the effect on your soul, if you knew you must lie
				   there enduring that torment to the full for twenty-four hours! And how
				   much greater would be the effect, if you knew you must endure it for a
				   whole year; and how vastly greater still, if you knew you must endure
				   it for a thousand years! O then, how would your heart sink, if you
				   thought, if you knew, that you must bear it forever and ever! That
				   there would be no end! That after millions of millions of ages, your
				   torment would be no nearer to an end, than ever it was; and that you
				   never, never should be delivered!
				</p><p>
				   But your torment in hell will be immensely greater than this
				   illustration represents. How then will the heart of a poor creature
				   sink under it! How utterly inexpressible and inconceivable must the
				   sinking of the soul be in such a case!
				</p><p>
				   This is the death threatened in the law. This is dying in the highest
				   sense of the word. This is to die sensibly; to die and know it; to be
				   sensible of the gloom of death. This is to be undone; this is worthy of
				   the name of destruction. This sinking of the soul under an infinite
				   weight, which it cannot bear, is the gloom of hell. We read in
				   Scripture of the blackness of darkness; this is it, this is the very
				   thing. We read in Scripture of sinners being lost, and of their losing
				   their souls: this is the thing intended; this is to lose the soul: they
				   that are the subjects of this are utterly lost.
				</p><p>
				<hi type="bold">Application</hi>
				</p><p>
				   This subject may be applied in a use of awakening to impenitent
				   sinners. What hath been said under this doctrine is for thee, O
				   impenitent sinner, O poor wretch, who art in the same miserable state
				   in which thou camest into the world, excepting that thou art loaded
				   with vastly greater guilt by thine actual sins. These dreadful things
				   which thou hast heard are for thee, who art yet unconverted, and still
				   remainest an alien and stranger, without Christ and without God in the
				   world. They are for thee, who to this day remainest an enemy to God,
				   and a child of the devil, even in this remarkable season, when others
				   both here and elsewhere, far and near, are flocking to Christ; for thee
				   who hearest the noise, the fame of these things, but knowest nothing of
				   the power of godliness in thine own heart.
				</p><p>
				   Whoever thou art, whether young or old, little or great, if thou art in
				   a Christless, unconverted state, this is the wrath, this is the death
				   to which thou art condemned. This is the wrath that abideth on thee;
				   this is the hell over which thou hangest, and into which thou art ready
				   to drop every day and every night.
				</p><p>
				   If thou shalt remain blind, and hard, and dead in sin a little longer,
				   this destruction will come upon thee: God hath spoken and he will do
				   it. It is vain for thee to flatter thyself with hopes that thou shalt
				   avoid it, or to say in thine heart, perhaps it will not be; perhaps it
				   will not be just so; perhaps things have been represented worse than
				   they are. If thou wilt not be convinced by the word preached to thee by
				   men in the name of God, God himself will undertake to convince thee,
				   Ezekiel xiv. 4, 7, 8.
				</p><p>
				   Doth it seem to thee not real that thou shalt suffer such a dreadful
				   destruction, because it seems to thee that thou dust not deserve it?
				   And because thou dust not see any thing so horrid in thyself, as to
				   answer such a dreadful punishment? Why is it that thy wickedness doth
				   not seem bad enough to deserve this punishment? The reason is, that
				   thou lovest thy wickedness; thy wickedness seems good to thee; it
				   appears lovely to thee; thou dust not see any hatefulness in it, or to
				   be sure, any such hatefulness as to answer such misery.
				</p><p>
				   But know, thou stupid, blind, hardened wretch, that God doth not see,
				   as thou seest with thy polluted eyes: thy sins in his sight are
				   infinitely abominable.-Thou knowest that thou hast a thousand and a
				   thousand times made light of the Majesty of God. And why should not
				   that Majesty, which thou hast thus despised, be manifested in the
				   greatness of thy punishment? Thou hast often heard what a great and
				   dreadful God Jehovah is; but thou hast made so light of it, that thou
				   hast not been afraid of him, thou hast not been afraid to sin against
				   him, nor to go on day after day, by thy sins, to provoke him to wrath,
				   nor to cast his commands under foot, and trample on them. Now why may
				   not God, in the greatness of thy destruction, justly vindicate and
				   manifest the greatness of that Majesty, which thou hast despised?
				</p><p>
				   Thou hast despised the mighty power of God; thou hast not been afraid
				   of it. Now why is it not fit that God should show the greatness of his
				   power in thy ruin? What king is there who will not show his authority
				   in the punishment of those subjects that despise it! And who will not
				   vindicate his royal majesty in executing vengeance on those that rise
				   in rebellion? And art thou such a fool as to think that the great King
				   of heaven and earth, before whom all other kings are so many
				   grasshoppers, will not vindicate his kingly Majesty on such
				   contemptuous rebels as thou art?-Thou art very much mistaken if thou
				   thinkest so. If thou be regardless of God's Majesty, be it known to
				   thee, God is not regardless of his own Majesty; he taketh care of the
				   honor of it, and he will vindicate it.
				</p><p>
				   Think it not strange that God should deal so severely with thee, or
				   that the wrath which thou shalt suffer should be so great. For as great
				   as it is, it is no greater than that love of God which thou hast
				   despised. The love of God, and his grace, condescension, and pity to
				   sinners in sending his Son into the world to die for them, is every
				   whit as great and wonderful as this inexpressible wrath. This mercy
				   hath been held forth to thee, and described in its wonderful greatness
				   hundreds of times, and as often hath it been offered to thee; but thou
				   wouldst not accept Christ; thou wouldst not have this great love of
				   God; thou despisedst God's dying love; thou trampledst the benefits of
				   it under foot. Now why shouldst thou not have wrath as great as that
				   love and mercy which thou despisest and rejectest? Doth it seem
				   incredible to thee, that God should so harden his heart against a poor
				   sinner, as so to destroy him, and to bear him down with infinite power
				   and merciless wrath? And is this a greater thing than it is for thee to
				   harden thy heart, as thou hast done, against infinite mercy, and
				   against the dying love of God?
				</p><p>
				   Doth it seem to thee incredible, that God should be so utterly
				   regardless of the sinner's welfare, as so to sink him into an infinite
				   abyss of misery? Is this shocking to thee? And is it not at all
				   shocking to thee, that thou shouldst be so utterly regardless as thou
				   hast been of the honor and glory of the infinite God?
				   It arises from thy foolish stupidity and senselessness, and is because
				   thou hast a heart of stone, that thou art so senseless of thine own
				   wickedness as to think thou hast not deserved such a punishment, and
				   that it is to thee incredible that it will be inflicted upon thee.-But
				   if, when all is said and done, thou be not convinced, wait but a little
				   while, and thou wilt be convinced: God will undertake to do the work
				   which ministers cannot do. -Though judgment against thine evil works be
				   not yet executed, and God now let thee alone, yet he will soon come
				   upon thee with his great power, and then thou shalt know what God is,
				   and what thou art.
				</p><p>
				   Flatter not thyself, that if these things shall prove true, and the
				   worst shall come, thou wilt set thyself to bear it as well as thou
				   canst. What will it signify to set thyself to bear, and to collect thy
				   strength to support thyself, when thou shalt fall into the hands of
				   that omnipotent King, Jehovah? He that made thee, can make his sword
				   approach unto thee. His sword is not the sword of man, nor is his wrath
				   the wrath of man. If it were, possibly stoutness might be maintained
				   under it. But it is the fierceness of the wrath of the great God, who
				   is able to baffle and dissipate all thy strength in a moment. He can
				   fill thy poor soul with an ocean of wrath, a deluge of fire and
				   brimstone; or he can make it ten thousand times fuller of torment than
				   ever an oven was full of fire; and at the same time, can fill it with
				   despair of ever seeing an end to its torment, or any rest from its
				   misery: and then where will be thy strength? What will become of thy
				   courage then? What will signify thine attempts to bear?
				</p><p>
				   What art thou in the hands of the great God, who made heaven and earth
				   by speaking a word? What art thou, when dealt with by that strength,
				   which manages all this vast universe, holds the globe of the earth,
				   directs all the motions of the heavenly bodies from age to age, and,
				   when the fixed time shall come, will shake all to pieces? There are
				   other wicked beings a thousand times stronger than thou: there are the
				   great leviathans, strong and proud spirits, of a gigantic stoutness and
				   hardiness. But how little are they in the hands of the great God! They
				   are less than weak infants; they are nothing, and less than nothing in
				   the hands of an angry God, as will appear at the day of judgment. Their
				   hearts will be broken; they will sink; they will have no strength nor
				   courage left; they will be as weak as water; their souls will sink down
				   into an infinite gloom, an abyss of death and despair. Then what will
				   become of thee, a poor worm, when thou shalt fall into the hands of
				   that God, when he shall come to show his wrath, and make his power
				   known on thee?
				</p><p>
				   If the strength of all the wicked men on earth, and of all the devils
				   in hell, were united in one, and thou wert possessed of it all; and if
				   the courage, greatness, and stoutness of all their hearts were united
				   in thy single heart, thou wouldst be nothing in the hands of Jehovah.
				   If it were all collected, and thou shouldst set thyself to bear as well
				   as thou couldst, all would sink under his great wrath in an instant,
				   and would be utterly abolished: thine hands would drop down at once and
				   thine heart would melt as wax.-The great mountains, the firm rocks,
				   cannot stand before the power of God; as fast as they stand, they are
				   tossed hither and thither, and skip like lambs, when God appears in his
				   anger. He can tear the earth in pieces iii a moment; yea, lie can
				   shatter the whole universe, and dash it to pieces at one blow. How then
				   will thine hands be strong, or thine heart endure?
				</p><p>
				   Thou canst not stand before a lion of the forest; an angry wild beast,
				   if stirred up, will easily tear such a one as thou art in pieces. Yea,
				   not only so, but thou art crushed before the moth. A very little thing,
				   a little worm or spider, or some such insect, is able to kill thee.
				   What then canst thou do in the hands of God? It is vain to set the
				   briers and thorns in battle array against glowing flames; the points of
				   thorns, though sharp, do nothing to withstand the fire.
				</p><p>
				   Some of you have seen buildings on fire; imagine therefore with
				   yourselves, what a poor hand you would make at fighting with the
				   flames, if you were in the midst of so great and fierce a fire. You
				   have often seen a spider, or some other noisome insect, when thrown
				   into the midst of a fierce fire, and have observed how immediately it
				   yields to the force of the flames. There is no long struggle, no
				   fighting against the fire, no strength exerted to oppose the heat, or
				   to fly from it; but it immediately stretches forth itself and yields;
				   and the fire takes possession of it, and at once it becomes full of
				   fire. Here is a little image of what you will be the subjects of in
				   hell, except you repent and fly to Christ. However you may think that
				   you will fortify yourselves, and bear as well as you can; the first
				   moment you shall be cast into hell, all your strength will sink and be
				   utterly abolished. To encourage yourselves, that you will set
				   yourselves to bear hell torments as well as you can, is just as if a
				   worm, that is about to be thrown into a glowing furnace, should swell
				   and fortify itself and prepare itself to fight the flames.
				</p><p>
				   What can you do with lightnings? What doth it signify to fight with
				   them? What an absurd figure would a poor weak man make, who, in a
				   thunder-storm, should expect a flash of lightning on his head or his
				   breast, and should go forth sword in hand to oppose it; when a stream
				   of brimstone would, in an instant, drink up all his spirits and his
				   life, and melt his sword!
				</p><p>
				   Consider these things, all you enemies of God, and rejecters of Christ,
				   whether you be old men or women, Christless heads of families, or young
				   people and wicked children. Be assured, that if you do not hearken and
				   repent, God intends to show his wrath, and make his power known upon
				   you. He intends to magnify himself exceedingly in sinking you down in
				   hell. He intends to show his great majesty at the day of judgment,
				   before a vast assembly, in your misery; before a greater assembly many
				   thousand fold than ever yet appeared on earth; before a vast assembly
				   of saints, and a vast assembly of wicked men, a vast assembly of holy
				   angels, and before all the crew of devils. God will before all these
				   get himself honor in your destruction; you shall be tormented in the
				   presence of them all. Then all will see that God is a great God indeed;
				   then all will see how dreadful a thing it is to sin against such a God,
				   and to reject such a Saviour, such love and grace, as you have rejected
				   and despised. All will be filled with awe at the great sight, and all
				   the saints and angels will look upon you, and adore that majesty, and
				   that mighty power, and that holiness and justice of God, which shall
				   appear in your ineffable destruction and misery.
				</p><p>
				   It is probable that here are some, who hear me this day, who at this
				   very moment are unawakened, and are in a great degree careless about
				   their souls. I fear there are some among us who are most fearfully
				   hardened: their hearts are harder than the very rocks. It is easier to
				   make impressions upon an adamant than upon their hearts. I suppose some
				   of you have heard all that I have said with ease and quietness: it
				   appears to you as great big sounding words, but doth not reach your
				   hearts. You have heard such things many times: you are old soldiers,
				   and have been too much used to the roaring of heaven's cannon, to be
				   frighted at it. It will therefore probably be in vain for me to say any
				   thing further to you; I will only put you in mind that ere long God
				   will deal with you. I cannot deal with you, you despise what I say; I
				   have no power to make you sensible of your danger and misery, and of
				   the dreadfulness of the wrath of God. The attempts of men in this way
				   have often proved vain.
				</p><p>
				   However, God hath undertaken to deal with such men as you are. It is
				   his manner commonly first to let men try their utmost strength:
				   particularly to let ministers try, that thus he may show ministers
				   their own weakness and impotency; and when they have done what they
				   can, and all fails, then God takes the matter into his own hands. So it
				   seems by your obstinacy, as if God intended to undertake to deal with
				   you. He will undertake to subdue you; he will see if he cannot cure you
				   of your senselessness and regardlessness of his threatenings. And you
				   will be convinced; you will be subdued effectually: your hearts will be
				   broken with a witness; your strength will be utterly broken, your
				   courage and hope will sink. God will surely break those who will not
				   bow. God, having girded himself with his power and wrath, hath
				   heretofore undertaken to deal with many hard stubborn, senseless,
				   obstinate hearts; and he never failed, he always did his work
				   thoroughly.
				   It will not be long before you will be wonderfully changed. You who now
				   hear of hell and the wrath of the great God, and sit here in these
				   seats so easy and quiet, and go away so careless; by and by will shake,
				   and tremble, and cry out, and shriek, and gnash your teeth, and will be
				   thoroughly convinced of the vast weight and importance of these great
				   things, which you now despise.
