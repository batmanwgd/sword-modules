<title>Prefatory Note.</title>
<p>
   The object of Dr Owen in this treatise is to illustrate the mystery of
   divine grace in the person of Christ. It bears the title,
   "Christologia;" but it differs considerably from modern works of the
   same title or character. It is not occupied with a formal induction
   from Scripture in proof of the supreme Godhead of the Saviour. Owen
   assumes the truth of this doctrine, and applies all his powers and
   resources to expound its relations in the Christian system, and its
   bearings on Christian duty and experience.
				</p><p>
   Chapter I. of the work is devoted to an exposition of <reference osisRef="Matt.16.16">Matthew 16:16</reference>, as
   a warrant and basis for his inquiry respecting the person of Christ.
   Chapter II. contains some historical references to the opposition
   encountered by this doctrine in past ages. From Chapter III. to VII.
   inclusive, the person of Christ is exhibited as the origin of all true
   religion, the foundation of the divine counsel, the representation of
   the divine nature and will, the embodiment and sum of divine truth, and
   the source of divine and gracious efficacy for the salvation of the
   church. The faith of the Old Testament Church respecting it is
   illustrated in Chapter VIII. Then follows the second leading division
   of the treatise, in which the divine honours and obedience due to
   Christ, and our obligation to seek conformity to him, are urged at some
   length, from Chapter IX. to XV. It is followed in Chapters XVI. and
   XVII. with an inquiry into the divine wisdom as manifested in the
   person of Christ. The hypostatical union is explained, Chapter XVIII.
   Two more Chapters, XIX. and XX., close the work, with a dissertation on
   the exaltation of Christ, and the mode in which he discharges his
   mediatorial functions in heaven.
				</p><p>
   The treatise was first published in 1679. We are not informed under
   what particular circumstances Owen was led to prepare it. There is
   internal evidence in the work itself that he laboured under a strong
   impression of the peril in which evangelical religion would be
   involved, if views of the person of Christ, either positively unsound
   or simple vague and defective, obtained currency in the British
   churches. His acquaintance with the early history of the church taught
   him that against this doctrine the persevering assaults of Satan had
   been directed; and, with sagacious foresight, he anticipated the rise
   of heresy on this point in England. He speaks of "woeful contests"
   respecting it, -- increasing rather than abating "to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this very day;"
   and intimates his conviction, in language which elucidates his main
   design in this work, that the only way by which they could be
   terminated was to enthrone Christ anew in the hearts and consciences of
   men.
				</p><p>
   Events ensued which justified these apprehensions of Owen. A prolonged
   controversy on the subject of the Trinity arose, which drew forth the
   works of Bull (1686), Sherlock (1690), and South (1695). In 1710,
   Whiston was expelled from Oxford for his Arianism. Dr S. Clarke, in
   1712, published Arian views, for which he was summoned before the
   Convocation. Among the Presbyterian Dissenters, Pierce and Hallet
   (1717) became openly committed to Arianism. Dr Isaac Watts who
   succeeded (1702) to the charge of the same congregation in London which
   had been under the care of Owen, broached the Indwelling Scheme;
   according to which the Father is so united to the man Christ Jesus,
   whose human soul pre-existed his coming in the flesh, that, through
   this indwelling of the Godhead, he became properly God.
				</p><p>
   The Christology of Owen has always been highly valued, and will be of
   use to all ages of the church: -- "A work," says the late Dr M'Crie,
   "which, together with its continuation, the Meditations on the Glory of
   Christ,' of all the theological works published by individuals since
   the Reformation, next to Calvin's Institutions', we would have deemed
   it our highest honour to have produced." -- Ed.

<title>The Preface.</title>
<p>
   It is a great promise concerning the person of Christ, as he was to be
   given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, (for he was a child born, a son given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us,
   <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>,) that God would "lay him in Zion for a foundation, a stone,
   a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation," whereon "he
   that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> shall not make haste:" <reference osisRef="Isa.28.16">Isaiah 28:16</reference> Yet was it also
   foretold concerning him, that this precious foundation should be "for a
   stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of
   Israel; for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;" so
   as that "many among them should stumble, and fall, and be broken, and
   be snared, and be taken:" <reference osisRef="Isa.8.14 Isa.8.15">Isaiah 8:14-15</reference> According to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this
   promise and prediction it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> fallen out in all ages of the church; as
   the apostle Peter declares concerning the first of them. "Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>
   also," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "it is contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in
   Sion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious; and he that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> on him
   shall not be confounded. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> ye therefore which believe, he is
   precious; but to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them which be disobedient, the stone which the
   builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a
   stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble
   at the word, being disobedient: to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> also they were appointed:" <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.6 1Pet.2.7 1Pet.2.8">1 Peter 2:6-8</reference>
				</p><p>
   To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that believe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saving of the soul, he is, he always
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been, precious -- the sun, the rock, the life, the bread of their
   souls -- every thing that is good, useful, amiable, desirable, here or
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity. In, from, and by him, is all their spiritual and eternal
   life, light, power, growth, consolation, and joy here; with everlasting
   salvation hereafter. By him alone do they desire, expect, and obtain
   deliverance from that woeful apostasy from God, which is accompanied
   with -- which contains<note n="containeth">Auto-modernized</note> in it virtually and meritoriously -- whatever
   is evil, noxious, and destructive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our nature, and which, without
   relief, will issue in eternal misery. By him are they brought into the
   nearest cognation, alliance, and friendship with God, the firmest union
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and the most holy communion with him, that our finite natures
   are capable of, and so conducted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal enjoyment of him. For
   in him "shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory;"
   (<reference osisRef="Isa.45.25">Isaiah 45:25</reference>;) for "Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an
   everlasting salvation;" they "shall not be ashamed nor confounded,
   world without end:" verse 17.
				</p><p>
   On these and the like accounts, the principal design of their whole
   lives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom he is thus precious, is to acquaint themselves with him
   -- the mystery of the wisdom, grace, and love of God, in his person and
   mediation, as revealed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the Scripture, which is "life
   eternal;" (<reference osisRef="John.17.3">John 17:3</reference>) -- to trust in him, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, as to all
   the everlasting concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of their souls -- to love and honour him
   with all their hearts -- to endeavour after conformity to him, in all
   those characters of divine goodness and holiness which are represented
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them in him. In these things consist the soul, life, power,
   beauty, and efficacy of the Christian religion; without which, whatever
   outward ornaments may be put upon its exercise, it is but a useless,
   lifeless carcass. The whole of this design is expressed in these
   heavenly words of the apostle: (<reference osisRef="Phil.3.8 Phil.3.9 Phil.3.10 Phil.3.11 Phil.3.12">Philippians 3:8-12</reference>). "Yea doubtless, and I
   count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
   Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do
   count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not
   having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
   through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
   faith: that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
   fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his death; if
   by any means I might attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the resurrection of the dead. Not as
   though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I
   follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
   apprehended of Christ Jesus." This is a divine expression of that frame
   of heart -- of that design -- which is predominant and efficacious in
   them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom Christ is precious.
				</p><p>
   But, on the other hand, (according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the fore-mentioned prediction,)
   as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been a sure foundation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all that believe, so he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in
   like manner been "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them
   that stumble at the word, being disobedient: to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> also they were
   appointed." There is nothing in him -- nothing in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is concerned
   -- nothing of him, his person, his natures, his office, his grace, his
   love, his power, his authority, his relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church -- but it
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> many a stone of stumbling and rock of offence.
   Concerning these things have been all the woeful contests which have
   fallen out and been managed among those that outwardly have made
   profession of the Christian religion. And the contentions about them do
   rather increase than abate, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this very day; the dismal fruits
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the world groans<note n="groaneth">Auto-modernized</note> under, and is no longer able to bear. For,
   as the opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ in these things, by men of
   perverse minds, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ruined their own souls -- as having dashed
   themselves in pieces against this everlasting rock -- so in union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>
   with other lusts and interests of the carnal minds of men, it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   filled the world itself with blood and confusion.
				</p><p>
   The re-enthroning of the Person, Spirit, Grace, and Authority of
   Christ, in the hearts and consciences of men, is the only way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   an end may be put to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these woeful conflicts. But this is not to be
   expected in any degree of perfection amongst them who stumble at this
   stone of offence, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they were appointed; though in the issue he
   will in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> also send forth judgment to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> victory, and all the meek of
   the earth shall follow after it. In the meantime, as those to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom he
   is thus a rock of offence -- in his person, his spirit, his grace, his
   office, and authority -- are diligent and restless (in their various
   ways and forms, in lesser or higher degrees, in secret artifices, or
   open contradictions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any or all of them, under various pretences,
   and for divers ends, even secular advantages some of them, which the
   craft of Satan has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> prepared for the ensnaring of them) in all ways of
   opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his glory; so it is the highest duty of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom
   he is precious, whose principal design is to be found built on him as
   the sure foundation, as to hold the truth concerning him, (his person,
   spirit, grace, office, and authority,) and to abound in all duties of
   faith, love, trust, honour, and delight in him -- so also to declare
   his excellency, to plead the cause of his glory, to vindicate his
   honour, and to witness him the only rest and reward of the souls of
   men, as they are called and have opportunity.
				</p><p>
   This, and no other, is the design of the ensuing treatise; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, as
   all things fall unspeakably short of the glory, excellency, and
   sublimity of the subject treated of, (for no mind can conceive, no
   tongue can express, the real substantial glory of them,) so there is no
   doubt but that in all the parts of it there is a reflection of failings
   and imperfections, from the weakness of its author. But yet I must say
   with confidence, that in the whole, that eternal truth of God
   concerning the mystery of his wisdom, love, grace, and power, in the
   person and mediation of Christ, with our duties towards himself
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, even the Father, Son, and eternal Spirit, is pleaded and
   vindicated, which shall never be shaken by the utmost endeavours and
   oppositions of the gates of hell.
				</p><p>
   And in the acknowledgment of the truth concerning these things
   consists, in a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner, that faith which was the life and
   glory of the primitive church, which they earnestly contended for,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> and through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they were victorious against all the troops of
   stumbling adversaries by whom it was assaulted. In giving testimony
   to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, they loved not their lives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the death, but poured out
   their blood like water, under all the pagan persecutions, which had no
   other design but to cast them down and separate them from this
   impregnable rock, this precious foundation. In the defence of these
   truths did they conflict, in prayers, studies, travels, and writings,
   against the swarms of seducers by whom they were opposed. And, for this
   cause, I thought to have confirmed the principal passages of the
   ensuing discourse with some testimonies from the most ancient writers
   of the first ages of the church; but I omitted that cause, as fearing
   that the interposition of such passages might obstruct instead of
   promoting the edification of the common sort of readers, which I
   principally intended. Yet, withal, I thought not good utterly to
   neglect that design, but to give at least a specimen of their
   sentiments about the principal truths pleaded for, in this preface to
   the whole. But in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, also, I met with a disappointment; for the
   bookseller having, unexpectedly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me, finished the printing of the
   discourse itself, I must be contented to make use of what lies<note n="lieth">Auto-modernized</note> already
   collected under my hand, not having leisure or time to make any farther
   inquiry.
				</p><p>
   I shall do something of this nature, the rather because I shall have
   occasion thereby to give a summary account of some of the principal
   parts of the discourse itself, and to clear some passages in it, which
   by some may be apprehended obscure.
				</p><p>
   Chap. I. The foundation of the whole is laid in the indication of those
   words of our blessed Saviour, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he declares himself to be the
   rock whereon the church is built: <reference osisRef="Matt.16.18">Matthew 16:18</reference> "And I say also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church;
   and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." The pretended
   ambiguity of these words has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been wrested by the secular interests of
   men, to give occasion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that prodigious controversy among
   Christians, viz., whether Jesus Christ or the Pope of Rome be the rock
   whereon the church is built. Those holy men of old to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom Christ was
   precious, being untainted with the desires of secular grandeur and
   power, knew nothing of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Testimonies may be -- they have been --
   multiplied by others to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this purpose. I shall mention some few of
   them.
				</p><p>
   Houtos estin he pros ton Patera agousa hodos, he petra, he kleis, ho
   poimen, etc.., says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Ignatius: Epist. ad Philadelph. -- "He" (that is,
   Christ) "is the way leading to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father, the rock, the key, the
   shepherd" -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this testimony. And Origen
   expressly denies the words to be spoken of Peter, in Matt. xvi: (Tract.
   i.:) " Quod si super unum illum Petrum tantum existimes totam ecclesiam
   �dificari, quid dicturus es de Johanne, et apostolorum unoquoque? Num
   audebimus dicere quod adversus Petrum unum non prevalitur� sunt port�
   inferorum? " -- "If you shall think that the whole church was built on
   Peter alone, what shall we say of John, and each of the apostles? What!
   shall we dare to say that the gates of hell shall not prevail against
   Peter only?" So he [held,] according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the common opinion of the
   ancients, that there was nothing peculiar in the confession of Peter,
   and the answer made to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, but that he spake and
   was spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in the name of all the rest of the apostles.
   Euseb.Pr�parat. Evang., lib. i. cap. 3: Hete onomasti prothespistheisa
   ekklesia autou hesteke kata bathous errhizomene, kai mechris ouranion
   hapsidon euchais hosion kai theophilon andron meteorizomene -- dia mian
   ekeinen, hen autos apephenato lexin, eipon, Epi ten petran oikodomeso
   mou ten ekklesian, kai pulai hadou ou katischususin autes. He proves
   the verity of divine predictions from the glorious accomplishment of
   that word, and the promise of our Saviour, that he would build his
   church on the rock, (that is, himself,) so as that the gates of hell
   should not prevail against it. For "Unum hoc est immobile fundamentum,
   una h�c est felix fidei Petra, Petri ore confessa, Tu es filius Dei
   vivi," says Hilaryde Trin., lib. ii. -- "This is the only immovable
   foundation, this is the blessed rock of faith confessed by Peter, Thou
   art the Son of the living God." And Epiphanius, H�r. xxxix.: Epi te
   petra taute tes asphalous pisteos oikodomeso mou ten ekklesian. --
   "Upon this rock" of assured faith "I will build my church." For many
   thought that faith itself was metonymically called the Rock, because of
   its object, or the person of Christ, which is so.
				</p><p>
   One or two more out of Augustine shall close these testimonies: " Super
   hanc Petram, quam confessus es, super meipsum filium Dei vivi,
   �dificabo ecclesiam meam. Super me �dificabo te, non me super te :" De
   Verbis Dom., Serm. xiii. -- "Upon this rock which thou hast confessed
   -- upon myself, the Son of the living God -- I will build my church. I
   will build thee upon myself, and not myself on thee." And he more fully
   declares<note n="declareth">Auto-modernized</note> his mind: (Tract. cxxiv., in Johan.:) "Universam significabat
   ecclesiam, qu� in hoc seculo diversis tentationibus, velut imbribus,
   fluminibus, tempestatibusque quatitur, et non cadit; quoniam fundata
   est supra Petram; unde et Petrus nomen accepit. Non enim a Petro Petra,
   sed Petrus a Petra; sicut non Christus a Christiano, sed Christianus a
   Christo vocatur. Ideo quippe ait Dominus, Super hanc Petram �dificabo
   ecclesiam meam,' quia dixerat Petrus, Tu es Christus filius Dei vivi.'
   Super hanc ergo' (inquit) Petram quam confessus es, �dificabo eccleaism
   meam.' Petra enim erat Christus, super quod fundamentum etiam ipse
   �dificatus est Petrus. Fundamentum quippe aliud nemo potest ponere,
   pr�ter id quod positum est, quod est Jesus Christus." -- "He (Christ)
   meant the universal church, which in this world is shaken with divers
   temptations, as with showers, floods, and tempests, yet falls<note n="falleth">Auto-modernized</note> not,
   because it is built on the rock (Petra) from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> Peter took his
   name. For the rock is not called Petra from Peter, but Peter is so
   called from Petra the rock; as Christ is not so called from Christian,
   but Christian from Christ. Therefore, said the Lord, Upon this rock
   will I build my church;' because Peter said, Thou art the Christ, the
   Son of the living God.' Upon this rock, which thou hast confessed, will
   I build my church. For Christ himself was the rock on which foundation
   Peter himself was built. For other foundation can no man lay, save that
   which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   Chap. II. Against this rock, this foundation of the church -- the
   person of Christ, and the faith of the church concerning it -- great
   opposition has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been made by the gates of hell. Not to mention the rage
   of the pagan world, endeavouring by all effects of violence and cruelty
   to cast the church from this foundation; all the heresies with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>
   from the beginning, and for some centuries of years ensuing, it was
   pestered, consisted in direct and immediate oppositions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   eternal truth concerning the person of Christ. Some that are so
   esteemed, indeed, never pretended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any sobriety, but were mere
   effects of delirant [raving] imaginations; yet did even they also, one
   way or other, derive from an hatred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, and
   centred in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. Their beginning was early in the church, even before
   the writing of the gospel by John, or of his Revelation, and indeed
   before some of Paul's epistles. And although their beginning was but
   small, and seemingly contemptible, yet, being full of the poison of the
   old serpent, they diffused themselves in various shapes and forms,
   until there was nothing left of Christ -- nothing that related to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him, not his natures, divine or human, not their properties nor acting,
   not his person, nor the union of his natures in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> -- that was not
   opposed and assaulted by them. Especially so soon as the gospel had
   subdued the Roman empire to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, and was owned by the rulers of
   it, the whole world was for some ages filled with uproars, confusion,
   and scandalous disorders about the person of Christ, through the cursed
   oppositions made to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> by the gates of hell. Neither had the church
   any rest from these conflicts for about five hundred years. But near
   that period of time, the power of truth and religion beginning
   universally to decay among the outward professors of them, Satan took
   advantage to make that havoc and destruction of the church -- by
   superstition, false worship, and profaneness of life -- which he failed
   of in his attempt against the person of Christ, or the doctrine of
   truth concerning it.
				</p><p>
   It would be a tedious work, and, it may be, not of much profit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them who are utterly unacquainted with things so long past and gone,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they seem to have no concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>, to give a specimen of the
   several heresies through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> attempts were made against this rock and
   foundation of the church. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those who have inquired into the records
   of antiquity, it would be altogether useless. For almost every page of
   them, at first view, presents the reader with an account of some one or
   more of them. Yet do I esteem it useful, that the very ordinary sort of
   Christians should, at least in general, be acquainted with what has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   passed in this great contest about the person of Christ, from the
   beginning. For there are two things relating to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> their
   faith is greatly concerned. First, There is evidence given in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the truth of those predictions of the Scripture, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this fatal
   apostasy from the truth, and opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, are
   foretold: and, secondly, An eminent instance of his power and
   faithfulness, in the appointment and conquest of the gates of hell in
   the management of this opposition. But they have been all reckoned up,
   and digested into methods of time and matter, by many learned men, (of
   old and of late,) so that I shall not in this occasional discourse
   represent them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the reader again. Only I shall give a brief account
   of the ways and means through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they who retained the profession of the
   truth contended for it, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a conquest over the pernicious heresies
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> it was opposed.
				</p><p>
   The defence of the truth, from the beginning, was left in charge to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>,
   and managed by, the guides and rulers of the church in their several
   capacities. And by the Scripture it was that they discharged their duty
   confirmed with apostolical tradition consonant to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. This was left
   in charge to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them by the great apostle, <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28 Acts.20.29 Acts.20.30 Acts.20.31">Acts 20:28-31</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Tim.6.13 1Tim.6.14">1 Timothy 6:13-14</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Tim.2.1 2Tim.2.2 2Tim.2.15 2Tim.2.23 2Tim.2.24">2 Timothy 2:1-2, 15, 23-24</reference>, iv. 1-5, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> any of them
   failed in this duty, they were reproved by Christ himself: <reference osisRef="Rev.2.14 Rev.2.15 Rev.2.20">Revelation of John 2:14-15, 20</reference> Nor were private believers (in their places and capacities)
   either unable for this duty or exempt from it, but discharged
   themselves faithfully in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> commandment given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them: <reference osisRef="1John.2.20 1John.2.27">1 John 2:20, 27</reference>, iv. 1-3; 2 John 8, 9. All true believers, in
   their several stations -- by mutual watchfulness, preaching, or
   writing, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their calls and abilities -- effectually used
   the outward means for the preservation and propagation of the faith of
   the church. And the same means are still sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same ends,
   were they attended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> with conscience and diligence. The pretended
   defence of truth with arts and arms of another kind has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been the bane
   of religion, and lost the peace of Christians beyond recovery. And it
   may be observed, that whilst this way alone for the preservation of the
   truth was insisted on and pursued, although innumerable heresies arose
   one after another, and sometimes many together, yet they never made any
   great progress, nor arrived to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any such consistency as to make a
   stated opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the truth; but the errors themselves and their
   authors, were as vagrant meteors, which appeared for a little while,
   and vanished away. Afterwards it was not so, when other ways and means
   for the suppression of heresies were judged convenient and needful.
				</p><p>
   For in process of time, when the power of the Roman empire gave
   countenance and protection to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Christian religion, another way was
   fixed on for this end, viz., the use of such assemblies of bishops and
   others as they called General Councils, armed with a mixed power,
   partly civil and partly ecclesiastical -- with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   authority of the emperors and that jurisdiction in the church which
   began then to be first talked of. This way was begun in the Council of
   Nice, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, although there was a determination of the doctrine
   concerning the person of Christ -- then in agitation, and opposed, as
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his divine nature in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> -- according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the truth, yet sundry
   evils and inconveniences ensued upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. For thenceforth the faith of
   Christians began greatly to be resolved into the authority of men, and
   as much, if not more weight to be laid on what was decreed by the
   fathers there assembled, than on what was clearly taught in the
   Scriptures. Besides, being necessitated, as they thought, to explain
   their conceptions of the divine nature of Christ in words either not
   used in the Scripture, or whose signification to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that purpose was not
   determined in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, occasion was given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> endless contentions about
   them. The Grecians themselves could not for a long season agree among
   themselves whether ousia and hupostasis were of the same signification
   or no, (both of them denoting essence and substance,) or whether they
   differed in their signification, or if they did, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> that
   difference lay. Athanasius at first affirmed them to be the same: Orat.
   v. con. Arian., and Epist. ad African.Basil denied them so to be, or
   that they were used to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same purpose in the Council of Nice:
   Epist. lxxviii. The like difference immediately fell out between the
   Grecians and Latins about "hypostasis" and "persona." For the Latins
   rendered "hypostasis" by "substantia," and prosopon by "persona."
   Of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> Jerome complains, in his Epistle to Damasus, that they required
   of him in the East to confess "tres hypostases," and he would only
   acknowledge "tres personas:" Epist. lxxi. And Augustine gives an
   account of the same difference: De Trinitate, lib v. cap. 8, 9.
   Athanasius endeavoured the composing of this difference, and in a good
   measure effected it, as Gregory Nazianzen affirms in his oration
   concerning his praise. It was done by him in a synod at Alexandria, in
   the first year of Julian's reign. On this occasion many contests arose
   even among them who all pleaded their adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the doctrine of
   the Council of Nice. And as the subtle Arians made incredible advantage
   of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> at first, pretending that they opposed not the deity of Christ,
   but only the expression of it by of homoousios, so afterwards they
   countenanced themselves in coining words and terms, to express their
   minds with, which utterly rejected it. Hence were their homoiousios,
   heterousios, ex ouk onton, and the like names of blasphemy, about which
   the contests were fierce and endless. And there were yet farther evils
   that ensued upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note>. For the curious and serpentine wits of men, finding
   themselves by this means set at liberty to think and discourse of those
   mysteries of the blessed Trinity, and the person of Christ, without
   much regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> plain divine testimonies, (in such ways in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   cunning and sophistry did much bear sway,) began to multiply such new,
   curious, and false notions about them, especially about the latter, as
   caused new disturbances, and those of large extent and long
   continuance. For their suppression, councils were called on the neck of
   one another, whereon commonly new occasions of differences did arise,
   and most of them managed with great scandal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Christian
   religion. For men began much to forego the primitive ways of opposing
   errors and extinguishing heresies; betaking themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their
   interest, the number of their party, and their prevalence with the
   present emperors. And although it so fell out -- as in that at
   Constantinople, the first at Ephesus, and that at Chalcedon -- that the
   truth (for the substance of it) did prevail, (for in many others it
   happened quite otherwise,) yet did they always give occasions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> new
   divisions, animosities, and even mutual hatreds, among the principal
   leaders of the Christian people. And great contests there were among
   some of those who pretended to believe the same truth, whether such or
   such a council should be received -- that is, plainly, whether the
   church should resolve its faith into their authority. The strifes of
   this nature about the first Ephesian Council, and that at Chalcedon,
   not to mention those in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the Arians prevailed, take up a good part
   of the ecclesiastical story of those days. And it cannot be denied, but
   that some of the principal persons and assemblies who adhered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   truth did, in the heat of opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the heresies of other men,
   fall into unjustifiable excess themselves.
				</p><p>
   We may take an instance of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Nestorian heresy,
   condemned in the first Ephesian Council, and afterwards in that at
   Chalcedon. Cyril of Alexandria, a man learned and vehement, designed by
   all means to be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it what his predecessor Athanasius had been to the
   Arian; but he fell into such excesses in his undertakings, as gave
   great occasion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> farther tumults. For it is evident that he
   distinguishes<note n="distinguisheth">Auto-modernized</note> not between hupostasis and phusis, and therefore
   affirms, that the divine Word and humanity had mia phusin, one nature
   only. So he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> plainly in Epist. ad Successum: "They are ignorant,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, hoti kat? aletheian esti mia phusis tou logou sesarkomene.
   Hence Eutyches the Archimandrite took occasion to run into a contrary
   extreme, being a no less fierce enemy to Nestoriusthan Cyril was. For
   to oppose him who divided the person of Christ into two, he confounded
   his natures into one -- his delirant folly being confirmed by that
   goodly assembly, the second at Ephesus. Besides, it is confessed that
   Cyril -- through the vehemency of his spirit, hatred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Nestorius,
   and following the conduct of his own mind in nice and subtle
   expressions of the great mystery of the person of Christ -- did utter
   many things exceeding the bounds of sobriety prescribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by the
   apostle, (<reference osisRef="Rom.12.3">Romans 12:3</reference>, if not those of truth itself. Hence it is come
   to pass, that many learned men begin to think and write that Cyril was
   in the wrong, and Nestorius by his means condemned undeservedly.
   However, it is certain to me, that the doctrine condemned at Ephesus
   and Chalcedon as the doctrine of Nestorius, was destructive of the true
   person of Christ; and that Cyril, though he missed it in sundry
   expressions, yet aimed at the declaration and confirmation of the
   truth; as he was long since vindicated by Theorianus: Dialog. con.
   Armenios.
				</p><p>
   However, such was the watchful care of Christ over the church, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the preservation of this sacred, fundamental truth, concerning his
   divine person, and the union of his natures in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, retaining their
   distinct properties and operations, that -- notwithstanding all the
   faction and disorder that were in those primitive councils, and the
   scandalous contests of many of the members of them; notwithstanding the
   determination contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it in great and numerous councils -- the
   faith of it was preserved entire in the hearts of all that truly
   believed, and triumphed over the gates of hell.
				</p><p>
   I have mentioned these few things, which belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the promise and
   prediction of our blessed Saviour in <reference osisRef="Matt.16.18">Matthew 16:18</reference>, (the place insisted
   on,) to show that the church, without any disadvantage to the truth,
   may be preserved without such general assemblies, which, in the
   following ages, proved the most pernicious engines for the corruption
   of the faith, worship, and manners of it. Yea, from the beginning, they
   were so far from being the only way of preserving truth, that it was
   almost constantly prejudiced by the addition of their authority to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the confirmation of it. Nor was there any one of them in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> "the
   mystery of iniquity" did not work, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the laying of some rubbish in
   the foundation of that fatal apostasy which afterwards openly ensued.
   The Lord Christ himself has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taken it upon him to build his church on
   this rock of his person, by true faith of it and in it. He sends his
   Holy Spirit to bear testimony to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, in all the blessed effects of
   his power and grace. He continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> his Word, with the faithful ministry
   of it, to reveal, declare, make known, and vindicate his sacred truth,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the conviction of gainsayers. He keeps up that faith in him, that
   love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, in the hearts of all his elect, as shall not be
   prevailed against. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, although the oppositions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this sacred
   truth, this fundamental article of the church and the Christian
   religion -- concerning his divine person, its constitution, and use, as
   the human nature conjoined substantially to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and subsisting in it
   -- are in this last age increased; although they are managed under so
   great a variety of forms, as that they are not reducible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any heads
   of order; although they are promoted with more subtlety and specious
   pretences than in former ages; yet, if we are not wanting to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   duty, with the aids of grace proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, we shall finally triumph
   in this cause, and transmit this sacred truth inviolate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that
   succeed us in the profession of it.
				</p><p>
   Chap. III. This person of Christ, which is the foundation whereon the
   church is built, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> all sorts of oppositions are endeavoured and
   designed, is the most ineffable effect of divine goodness and wisdom --
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we treat in the next place. But in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, when I speak of the
   constitution of the person of Christ, I intend not his person
   absolutely, as he is the eternal Son of God. He was truly, really,
   completely, a divine person from eternity, which is included in the
   notion of his being the Son, and so distinct from the Father, which is
   his complete personality. His being so was not a voluntary contrivance
   or effect of divine wisdom and goodness, his eternal generation being a
   necessary internal act of the divine nature in the person of the
   Father.
				</p><p>
   Of the eternal generation of the divine person of the Son, the sober
   writers of the ancient church did constantly affirm that it was firmly
   to be believed, but as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the manner of it not to be inquired into.
   "Scrutator majestatis absorbetur a gloria," was their rule; and the
   curious disputes of Alexander and Arius about it, gave occasion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   that many-headed monster of the Arian heresy which afterwards ensued.
   For when once men of subtile heads and unsanctified hearts gave
   themselves up to inquire into things infinitely above their
   understanding and capacity -- being vainly puffed up in their fleshly
   minds -- they fell into endless divisions among themselves, agreeing
   only in an opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the truth. But those who contented
   themselves to be wise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sobriety, repressed this impious boldness.
   To this purpose speaks Lactantius: (lib. iv., De Ver� Sapient.:)
   "Quomodo igitur procreavit? Nec sciri a quoquam possunt, nec narrari,
   opera divina; sed tamen sacr� liter� docent illum Dei filium, Dei esse
   sermonem." -- "How, therefore, did the Father beget the Son? These
   divine works can be known of none, declared by none; but the holy
   writings" (in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is determined) "teach that he is the Son of God,
   that he is the Word of God." And Ambrose: (De Fide, ad Gratianum:)
   "Qu�ro abs te, quando aut quomodo putes filium esse generatum? Mihi
   enim impossibile est scire generationis secretum. Mens deficit, vox
   silet, non mea tantum, sed et angelorum. Supra potestates, supra
   angelos, supra cherubim, supra seraphim, supra omnem sensum est. Tu
   quoque manum ori admove; scrutari non licet superna mysteria. Licet
   scire quod natus sit, non licet discutere quomodo natus sit; illud
   negare mihi non licet, hoc qu�rere metus est. Nam si Paulus ea qu�
   audivit, raptus in tertium coelum, ineffabilia dicit, quomodo nos
   exprimere possumus patern� generationis arcanum, quod nec sentire
   potuimus nec audire? Quid te ista questionum tormenta delectant?" -- "I
   inquire of you when and how the Son was begotten? Impossible it is to
   me to know the mystery of this generation. My mind fails<note n="faileth">Auto-modernized</note>, my voice is
   silent -- and not only mine, but of the angels; it is above
   principalities, above angels, above the cherubim, above the seraphim,
   above all understanding. Lay thy hand on thy mouth; it is not lawful to
   search into these heavenly mysteries. It is lawful to know that he was
   born -- it is not lawful to discuss how he was born; that it is not
   lawful for me to deny -- this I am afraid to inquire into. For if Paul,
   when he was taken into the third heaven, affirms that the things which
   he heard could not be uttered; how can we express the mystery of the
   divine generation, which we can neither apprehend nor hear? Why do such
   tormenting questions delight thee?"
				</p><p>
   Ephraim Syrus wrote a book to this purpose, against those who would
   search out the nature of the Son of God. Among many other things to the
   same purpose are his words: (cap. ii.:) "Infelix profecto, miser, atque
   impudentissimus est, qui scrutari cupot Opificem suum. Millia millium,
   et centies millies millena millia angelorum et archangelorum, cum
   horrore glorificant, et trementes adorant; et homines lutei, pleni
   peccatis, de divinitate intrepide disserunt? Non illorum exhorrescit
   corpus, non contremescit animus; sed securi et garruli, de Christo Dei
   filio, qui pro me indigno peccatore passus est, deque ipsius utraque
   generatione loquuntur; nec saltem quod in luce c�cutiunt, sentiunt." --
   "He is unhappy, miserable, and most impudent, who desires to examine or
   search out his Maker. Thousands of thousands, and hundreds of thousands
   of millions of angels and archangels, do glorify him with dread, and
   adore him with trembling; and shall men of clay, full of sins, dispute
   of the Deity without fear? Horror does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not shake their bodies, their
   minds do not tremble, but being secure and prating, they speak of the
   Son of God, who suffered for me, unworthy sinner, and of both his
   nativities or generations; at least they are not sensible how blind
   they are in the light." To the same purpose speaks Eusebius at large:
   Demonstratio Evang., lib. v. cap. 2.
				</p><p>
   Leo well adds to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of his incarnation, in these
   excellent words: (Serm. ix., De Nativit.:) "Quia in Christo Jesu Filio
   Dei non solum ad divinam essentiam, sed etiam ad humanam spectat
   naturam, quo dictum est per prophetam -- generationem ejus quis
   enarrabit?' -- (utramque enim substantiam in unam convenisse personam,
   nisi fides credat, sermo non explicat; et ideo materia nunquam deficit
   laudis; qui nunquam sufficit copia laudatoris) -- gaudeamus igitur quod
   ad eloquendum tantum, misericordi� sacramentum impares sumus; et cum
   salutis nostr� altitudinem promere non valeamus, sentiamus nobis bonum
   esse quod vincimur. Nemo enim ad cognitionem veritatis magis
   propinquat, quam qui intelligit, in rebus divinis, etiamsi multum
   proficiat, semper sibi superesse quod qu�rat." See also Fulg., lib. ii.
   ad Thrasimund.
				</p><p>
   But I speak of the person of Christ as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the assumption of the
   substantial adjunct of the human nature, not to be a part of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> his
   person is composed, but as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its subsistence in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> by virtue of a
   substantial union. Some of the ancients, I confess, speak freely of the
   composition of the person of Christ in and by the two natures, the
   divine and human. That the Son of God after his incarnation had one
   nature, composed of the Deity and humanity, was the heresy of
   Apollinarius, Eutyches, the Monothelites, or Monophysites, condemned by
   all. But that his most simple divine nature, and the human, composed
   properly of soul and body, did compose his one person, or that it was
   composed of them, they constantly affirmed. Ton Theou mesiten kai
   anthropon, kata tas graphas sunkeisthai phamen ek te tes kath? hemas
   anthropotetos teleios echousas kata ton idion logon, kai ek tou
   pephenotos, ek Theou kata phusin huiou, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Cyril of Alexandria. --
   "A sanctis patribus adunatione ex divinitate et humanitate Christus
   Dominus noster compositus pr�dicatur:" Pet. Diacon., Lib. De Incarnat.
   et Grat. Christi, ad Fulgentium. And the union which they intended by
   this composition they called henosin phusiken, because it was of
   diverse natures, and henosin kata sunthesin, a union by composition.
				</p><p>
   But because there neither was nor can be any composition, properly so
   called, of the divine and human natures, and because the Son of God was
   a perfect person before his incarnation, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he remained what he
   was, and was made what he was not, the expression has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been forsaken
   and avoided; the union being better expressed by the assumption of a
   substantial adjunct, or the human nature into personal subsistence with
   the Son of God, as shall be afterwards explained. This they constantly
   admire as the most ineffable effect of divine wisdom and grace: Ho
   asarkos sarkoutai, ho logos pachunetai, ho aoratos horatai, ho anaphes
   pselaphatai, ho achronos archetai, ho huios Theou huios anthropou
   ginetai, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. xii.,) in admiration of this
   mystery. Hereby God communicates all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us from his own
   glorious fulness, the near approaches of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are not able to bear.
   So is it illustrated by Eusebius: (Demonst. Evang., lib. iv. cap.5,
   etc..:) Ohuto de photos heliou mia kai he aute prosbole homou kai kata to
   auto kataugazei men aera, photizei de ophthalmous, haphen de
   thermainei, piainei de gen, auxei de phuta, k. t. l. (cap. vi.) Ei goun
   hos en hupothesei logou, katheis ouranothen autos heauton pamphaes
   helios sun anthropois epi ges politeuoito, oudena ton epi tes ges
   meinai an adiaphoron, panton sullebden empsuchon homou kai apsuchon
   athroa te tou photos prosbole diaphtharesomenon. The sense of which
   words, with some that follow in the same place, is to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this purpose:
   By the beams of the sunlight, and life, and heat, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the procreation,
   sustentation, refreshment, and cherishing of all things, are
   communicated. But if the sun itself should come down to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the earth,
   nothing could bear its heat and lustre; our eyes would not be
   enlightened but darkened by its glory, and all things be swallowed up
   and consumed by its greatness; whereas, through the beams of it, every
   thing is enlightened and kindly refreshed. So is it with this eternal
   beam or brightness of the Father's glory. We cannot bear the immediate
   approach of the Divine Being; but through him, as incarnate, are all
   things communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, in a way suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our reception and
   comprehension.
				</p><p>
   So it is admired by Leo: (Serm. iii., De Nativit.:) "Natura humana in
   Creatoris societatem assumpta est, non ut ille habitator, et illa esset
   habitaculum; sed ut natur� alteri sic misceretur altera, ut quamvis
   alia sit qu� suscipitur, alia vero qu� suscepit, in tantam tamen
   unitatem conveniret utriusque diversitas, ut unus idemque sit filius,
   qui se, et secundum quod verus est homo, Patre dicit minorem, et
   secundum quod verus est Deus Patri se profitetur �qualem." -- "Human
   nature is assumed into the society of the Creator, not that he should
   be the inhabitant, and that the habitation," (that is, by an
   inhabitation in the effects of his power and grace, for otherwise the
   fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily,) "but that one nature
   should be so mingled" (that is, conjoined) "with the other, that
   although that be of one kind which assumes<note n="assumeth">Auto-modernized</note>, and that of another which
   is assumed, yet the diversity of them both should concur in such a
   unity or union, as that it is one and the same Son -- who, as he was a
   true man, said that he was less than the Father, or the Father was
   greater than he -- so as he was true God, professes<note n="professeth">Auto-modernized</note> himself equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the Father." See also AugustinusDe Fide, ad Pet. Diacon., cap. xvii.;
   Justitianus ImperatorEpist. ad Hormisdam, Rom� Episcop.
				</p><p>
   And the mystery is well expressed by Maxentius: (Biblioth. Patr. pars
   prima:) "Non confundimus naturarum diversitatem; veruntamen Christum
   non ut tu asseris Deum factum, sed Deum factum Christum confitemur.
   Quia non cum pauper esset, dives factus est, sed cum dives esset,
   pauper factus est, ut nos divites faceret; neque enim cum esset in
   form� servi, formam Dei accepit; sed cum esset in form� Dei, formam
   servi accepit; similiter etiam nec, cum esset caro, verbum est factum;
   sed cum esset verbum, caro factum est." -- "We do not confound the
   diversity of the natures, nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> we believe not what you affirm, that
   Christ was made God; but we believe that God was made Christ. For he
   was not made rich when he was poor; but being rich, he was made poor,
   that he might make us rich. He did not take the form of God when he was
   in the form of a servant; but being in the form of God, he took on him
   the form of a servant. In like manner, he was not made the Word when he
   was flesh; but being the Word, he was made flesh."
				</p><p>
   And Jerome, speaking of the effects of this mystery: (Comment. in
   Ezekiel, cap. xlvi.:) "Ne miretur lector si idem et Princeps est et
   Sacerdos, et Vitulus, et Aries, et Agnus; cum in Scripturis sanctis pro
   varietate causarum legamus eum Dominum, et Deum, et Hominem, et
   Prophetam, et Virgam, et Radicem, et Florem, et Principem, et Regem
   justum, et Justitiam, Apostolum, et Episcopum, Brachium, Servum,
   Angelum, Pastorem, Filium, et Unigenitum, et Promogenitum, Ostium,
   Viam, Sagittam, Sapientiam, et multa alia." -- "Let not the reader
   wonder if he find one and the same to be the Prince and Priest, the
   Bullock, Ram, and Lamb; for in the Scripture, on variety of causes, we
   find him called Lord, God, and Man, the Prophet, a Rod, and the Root,
   the Flower, Prince, Judge, and Righteous King; Righteousness, the
   Apostle and Bishop, the Arm and Servant of God, the Angel, the
   Shepherd, the Son, the Only-begotten, the First-begotten, the Door, the
   Way, the Arrow, Wisdom, and sundry other things." And Ennodius has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, as
   it were, turned this passage of Jerome into verse: 
				</p><p>
   "Corda domat, qui cuncta videt, quem cuncta tremiscunt;
				</p><p>
   Fons, via, dextra, lapis, vitulus, leo, lucifer, agnus;
				</p><p>
   Janua, spes, virtus, verbum, sapientia, vates.
				</p><p>
   Ostia, virgultum, pastor, mons, rete, columba,
				</p><p>
   Flama, gigas, aquila, sponsus, patientia, nervus,
				</p><p>
   Filius, excelsus, Dominus, Deus; omnia Christus."
				</p><p>
   (In natalem Pap� Epiphanii.)
				</p><p>
   "Quod homo est esse Christus voluit; ut et homo possit esse quod
   Christus est," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Cyprian: De Idolorum Vanitate, cap. iii. And,
   "Quod est Christus erimus Christiani, si Christum fuerimus imitati:"
   Ibid. And he explains his mind in this expression by way of admiration:
   (Lib. de Eleemosyn.:) "Christus hominis filius fieri voluit, ut nos Dei
   filios faceret; humiliavit se, ut populum qui prius jacebat, erigeret;
   vulneratus est, ut vulnera nostra curaret."
				</p><p>
   Chap. IV. That he was the foundation of all the holy counsels of God,
   with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the vocation, sanctification, justification, and
   eternal salvation of the church, is, in the next place, at large
   declared. And he was so on a threefold account. 1. Of the ineffable
   mutual delight of the Father and the Son in those counsels from all
   eternity. 2. As the only way and means of the accomplishment of all
   those counsels, and the communication of their effects, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   eternal glory of God. 3. As he was in his own person, as incarnate, the
   idea and exemplar in the mind of God of all that grace and glory in the
   church which was designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it in those eternal counsels. As the
   cause of all good to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, he is on this account acknowledged by the
   ancients. Houtos goun ho logos, ho Christos kai tou einai palai hemas,
   en gar en Theo, kai tou eu einai aitios. Nun de etephane anthropois,
   autos houtos ho logos, ho monos ampho Theos te kai anthropos, hapanton
   hemin aitios agathon, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> Clemens, Adhort. ad Gentes. -- "He,
   therefore, is the Word, the Christ, and the cause of old of our being;
   for he was in God, and the cause of our wellbeing. But now he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   appeared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men, the same eternal Word, who alone is both God and
   man, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us the cause of all that is good." As he was in God the
   cause of our being and wellbeing from eternity, he was the foundation
   of the divine counsels in the way explained; and in his incarnation,
   the execution of them all was committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, that through him all
   actual good, all the fruits of those counsels, might be communicated
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   Chap. V. He is also declared in the next place, as he is the image and
   great representative of God, even the Father, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church. On what
   various accounts he is so called, is fully declared in the discourse
   itself. In his divine person, as he was the only begotten of the Father
   from eternity, he is the essential image of the Father, by the
   generation of his person, and the communication of the divine nature
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. As he is incarnate, he is both in his own entire
   person God and man, and in the administration of his office, the image
   or representative of the nature and will of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as is fully
   proved. So speaks Clem. Alexandrin., Adhort. ad Gentes: He men gar tou
   Theou eikon ho logos autou, kai huios tou nou gnesios, ho theios logos,
   photos archetupon phos, eikon de tou logou ho anthpopos. -- "The image
   of God is his own Word, the natural Son of the (eternal) Mind, the
   divine Word, the original Light of Light; and the image of the Word is
   man." And the same author again, in his P�dagogus: Prosopon tou Theou
   ho logos ho photizetai ho Theos kai gnorizetai. -- "The Word is the
   face, the countenance, the representation of God, in whom he is brought
   to light and made known." As he is in his divine person his eternal,
   essential image; so, in his incarnation, as the teacher of men, he is
   the representative image of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, as is afterwards
   declared.
				</p><p>
   So also Jerome expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> his mind in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>: (Comment. in Psal. lxvi.:)
   "Illuminet vultum suum super nos; Dei facies qu� est? utique imago
   ejus. Dicit enim apostolus imaginem Patris esse filium; ergo imagine
   sua nos illuminet; hoc est, imaginem suam filium illuminet super nos;
   ut ipse nos illuminet; lux enim Patris lux filii est." -- "Let him
   cause his face to shine upon us; or lift up the light of his
   countenance upon us. What is the face of God? even his image. For the
   apostle says, that the Son is the image of the Father. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, let
   him shine on us with his image; that is, cause his Son, which is his
   image, to shine upon us, that he may illuminate us; for the light of
   the Father and of the Son are the same." Christ being the image of God,
   the face of God, in him is God represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and through him are
   all saving benefits communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that believe.
				</p><p>
   Eusebius also speaks often to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this purpose, as: (Demonstratio
   Evangelica, lib. iv. cap. 2:) Hothen eikotos hoi chresmoi
   theologounted, Theon geneton auton apophainousin, hos an tes
   anekphrastou kai aperinoetou theotetos monon en auto pheronta ten
   eikona, di? hen kai Theon einai te auton kai legesthai tes pros to
   proton exomoioseos charin. -- "Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the holy oracles, speaking
   theologically, or teaching divine things, do rightly call him God
   begotten," (of the Father,) "as he who alone bears in himself the image
   of the ineffable and inconceivable Deity. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, he both is, and is
   called God, because of his being the character, similitude, or image of
   him who is the first." The divine personality of Christ consists in
   this, that the whole divine nature being communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by
   eternal generation, he is the image of God, even the Father, who by him
   is represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. See the same book, chap. vii., to the same
   purpose; also, De Ecclesiast. Theol. contra Marcell., lib. ii. cap. 17.
				</p><p>
   Clemens abounds much in the affirmation of this truth concerning the
   person of Christ, and we may yet add, from a multitude to the same
   purpose, one or more testimonies from him. Treating of Christ as the
   teacher of all men, his paidagogos, he affirms that he is Theos en
   anthropou schemati, "God in the figure or form of man;" achrantos,
   patriko thelemati diakonos, logos, Theos, ho en patri ho ek dexion tou
   patros, sun kai to schemati Theou, "impolluted, serving the will of the
   Father, the Word, God, who is in the Father, on the right hand of the
   Father, and in or with the form of God." Outos hemin eikon he
   akelidotos, touto panti sthenei peirateon exomoioun ten psuchen. -- "He
   is the image (of God) to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there is no blemish; and with
   all our strength are we to endeavour to render ourselves like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him." This is the great end of his being the representative image of
   God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. And: (Stromat., lib. iv.:) Ho men oun Theos anapodeiktos
   on, ouk estin epistemonikos. Ho de huios sophia te esti kai episteme,
   kai aletheia, kai, hosa alla touto sungene. -- "As God (absolutely)
   falls not under demonstration, (that is, cannot perfectly be declared,)
   so he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not (immediately) effect or teach us knowledge. But the Son
   is wisdom, and knowledge, and truth, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and every thing which is
   cognate to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>." For in and by him does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> God teach us, and represent
   himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   Chap. VII. Upon the glory of this divine person of Christ depends the
   efficacy of all his offices; a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> demonstration of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is given
   in his prophetical office. So it is well expressed by Iren�us, "qui nil
   molitur inept�:" Lib. i. cap. 1. "Non enim aliter nos discere poteramus
   qu� sunt Dei, nisi magister noster verbum existens, homo ffactus
   fuisset. Neque enim alius poterat enarrare nobis qu� sunt Patris, nisi
   proprium ipsius verbum. Quis enim alius cognovit sensum Domini? aut
   quis alius ejus consiliarius factus est? Neque rursus nos aliter
   discere poteramus, nisi Magistrum nostrum videntes, et per auditum
   nostrum vocem ejus percipientes, uti imitatores quidem operum, factores
   autem sermonum ejus facti, communionem habeamus cum ipso." -- "We could
   not otherwise have learned the things of God, unless our Master, being
   and continuing the" (eternal) "Word, had been made man. For no other
   could declare to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us the things of God, but his own proper Word. For
   who else has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> known the mind of the Lord? or who else has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been his
   counsellor? Neither, on the other side, could we otherwise have
   learned, unless we had seen our Master, and heard his voice," (in his
   incarnation and ministry,) "through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>, following his works, and yielding
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his doctrine, we may have communion with himself."
				</p><p>
   I do perceive that if I should proceed with the same kind of
   attestations to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the doctrine of all the chapters in the ensuing
   discourse, this preface would be drawn forth to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a greater length than
   was ever designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, or is convenient for it. I shall therefore
   choose out one or two instances more, to give a specimen of the
   concurrence of the ancient church in the doctrine declared in them, and
   so put a close to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it.
				</p><p>
   Chap. IX. In the ninth chapter and those following, we treat of the
   divine honour that is due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, expressed in
   adoration, invocation, and obedience, proceeding from faith and love.
   And the foundation of the whole is laid in the discovery of the true
   nature and causes of that honour; and three things are designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   confirmation in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>. 1. That the divine nature, which is individually
   the same in each person of the holy Trinity, is the proper formal
   object of all divine worship, in adoration and invocation; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>,
   no one person is or can be worshipped, but in the same individual act
   of worship each person is equally worshipped and adored. 2. That it is
   lawful to direct divine honour, worship, and invocation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any
   person, in the use of his peculiar name -- the Father, Son, or Spirit
   -- or to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them altogether; but to make any request to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one person,
   and immediately the same to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another, is not exemplified in the
   Scripture, nor among the ancient writers of the church. 3. That the
   person of Christ, as God-man, is the proper object of all divine honour
   and worship, on the account of his divine nature; and all that he did
   in his human nature are motives to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   The first of these is the constant doctrine of the whole ancient
   church, viz, that whether, (for instance,) in our solemn prayers and
   invocations, we call expressly on the name of the Father, or of the
   Son, or of the Holy Spirit; whether we do it absolutely or relatively,
   that is, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the relation of one person to the other --
   as calling on God as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, on Christ as
   the Son of his love, on the Holy Spirit as proceeding from them both --
   we do formally invocate and call on the divine nature, and consequently
   the whole Trinity, and each person in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. This truth they principally
   confirmed with the form of our initiation into Christ at baptism: "I
   baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Ghost." For as there is contained in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> the sum of all divine honour,
   so it is directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same name, (not the names,) of the Father,
   Son, and Spirit, which is the same Deity or divine nature alone.
				</p><p>
   So speak the Fathers of the second General Council in their letters
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the bishops of the west; as they are expressed in Theodoret, lib.
   v. cap. 9. This form of baptism teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> us, say they, Pisteuein eis to
   onoma tou patros, kai tou huiou, kai tou hagiou pneumatos, delade,
   theotetos te kai dunameos kai ousias mias tou patros, kai tou huiou,
   kai tou hagiou pneumatos pisteuomenes, homotimou tes axias, kai
   sunaidiou tes basileias, en trisi teleiais hupostasesi. -- "to believe
   in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
   seeing that the Deity, substance, and power of the Father, Son, and
   Holy Spirit, is one and the same; their dignity equal; their kingdom
   co-eternal, in three perfect persons." "In nomine dixit, non nominibus,
   ergo non aliud nomen Patris est," etc.., "quia unus Deus:" Ambrose, De
   Spirit. Sanct., lib. i. cap. 14. Onoma de koinon ton trion hen, he
   theotes. -- "The one name common to the three is the Deity:" Gregor.
   Nazianzen, Orat. xl. Hence Augustine gives it as a rule, in speaking of
   the Holy Trinity: "Quando unus trium in aliquo opere nominatur,
   universa operari trinitas intelligitur:" Enchirid., cap. xxxviii. --
   "When one person of the three is named in any work, the whole Trinity
   is to be understood to effect it." "There is one Lord, one faith, one
   baptism," according to the Scriptures. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as there is one faith
   in Christ, and one baptism of truth, although we are baptized and
   believe in the Father, Son, and Spirit, kata ton auton, oimai, tropon
   kai logon, mia proskunesis he patros, kai enanthropesantos huiou, kai
   hagiou pneumatos; -- "so plainly, in my judgment, there is one and the
   same adoration, of the Father, the Son incarnate, and the Holy Spirit:"
   Cyril. Alex.De Recta Fide, cap. xxxii.
				</p><p>
   And this they professed themselves to hold and believe, in that ancient
   doxology which was first invented to decry the Arian heresy: "Glory be
   to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost." The same glory,
   in every individual act of its assignation or ascription, is directed
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> each person jointly and distinctly, on the account of the same
   divine nature in each of them. I need not produce any testimonies in
   the farther confirmation of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>; for, in all their writings against the
   Arians, they expressly and constantly contend that the holy Trinity
   (that is, the divine nature in three persons) is the individual object
   of all divine adoration, invocation, and all religious worship; and
   that by whatever personal name -- as the Father, Son, or Spirit -- we
   call on God, it is God absolutely who is adored, and each person
   participant of the same nature. See August.Lib. con. Serm. Arian. cap.
   xxxv., and Epist. lxvi. ad Maximum.
				</p><p>
   For the second thing, or the invocation of God by any personal name, or
   by the union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note> of the distinct names of the Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit together, nothing occurs more frequently among them. Yea, it is
   common to find in their writings, prayers begun to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one person, and
   ended in the name of another; yea, begun to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, and closed in the
   name of His only-begotten Son; it being one and the same divine nature
   that is called on. Yea, the schoolmen do generally deny that the
   persons of the holy Trinity, under the consideration of the formal
   reason which is constitutive of their personality, are the formal
   object and term of divine worship; but in the worship of one, they are
   all worshipped as one God over all, blessed for ever. See Aquin.xxii.
   q. 81, a. 3, ad prim., and q. 84, a. 1, ad tertium; Alexand. Alens.p.
   3, q. 30, m. 1, a. 3.
				</p><p>
   But yet, although we may call on God in and by the name of any divine
   person, or enumerate at once each person, (o trias hagia arithmoumene,
   trias en heni onomati arithmoumene,Epiphan. Ancorat., viii. 22,) it
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not follow that we may make a request in our prayers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one
   person, and then immediately repeat it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another; for it would
   thence follow, that the person to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom we make that request in the
   second place, was not invocated, not called on, not equally adored with
   him who was so called on in the first place, although the divine nature
   is the object of all religious invocation, which is the same in each
   person. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, in our divine invocation, we may name and fix our
   thoughts distinctly on any person, according as our souls are affected
   with the distinct operations of each person in grace towards us.
				</p><p>
   For what concerns, in the third place, the ascription of divine honour,
   in adoration and invocation, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ; it is that
   which they principally contended for, and argued from, in all their
   writings against the Arians.
				</p><p>
   Evidences of infinite wisdom in the constitution of the person of
   Christ, and rational discoveries of the condecencies in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   exaltation of all the other glorious properties of the divine nature,
   are also treated of. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> we consider the incarnation of the Son of
   God, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the recovery and salvation of the church alone.
   Some have contended that he should have been incarnate, had man never
   fallen or sinned. Of these are Rupertus, lib. iii., De Glori� et Honore
   Filii Hominis; Albertus Magnus, in iii. distinct. 10, a 4; Petrus
   Galatinus, lib. iii. cap.4; as are Scotus, Halensis, and others, whom
   Osiander followed. The same is affirmed by Socinus concerning the birth
   of that man, which alone he fancied him to be, as I have elsewhere
   declared. But I have disproved this figment at large. Many of the
   ancients have laboured in this argument, of the necessity of the
   incarnation of the eternal Word, and the condecencies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine
   wisdom in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. See Iren�us, lib iii., cap. 20, 21; Eusebius, Demonst.
   Evangel., lib iv. cap. 1-4, etc..; Cyril Alexand., lib. v. cap. 7, lib i.
   De Fide ad Regin.; Chrysostom, Homil. x. in Johan., et in cap.8, ad
   Rom. Serm. 18; Augustine, De Trinit., lib. xiii. cap. 13-20; Leo,
   Epist. 13, 18, Sermo. de Nativit. 1, 4, 10; Basil, in Psal. xlviii.;
   Albinus, lib i. in Johan. cap. 11; Damascen., lib. iii., De Fide, cap.
   15, 19; Anselm, quod Deus Homo, lib. duo. Guil. Parisiensis, lib. Cur
   Deus Homo. Some special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> testimonies we may produce in confirmation of
   what we have discoursed, in the places directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. There is one of
   them, one of the most ancient, the most learned, and most holy of them,
   who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> so fully delivered his thoughts concerning this mystery, as
   that I shall principally make use of his testimony in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   It belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the wisdom and righteousness of God, that Satan should
   be conquered and subdued in and by the same nature which he had
   prevailed against, by his suggestion and temptation. To this purpose
   that holy writer speaks, (lib. iii. cap. 20,) which, because his words
   are cited by Theodoret, (Dial. ii.,) I shall transcribe them from
   thence, as free from the injuries of his barbarous translator: Henosen
   oun kathos proephamen ton anthropon to Theo, ei gar me anthropos
   enikesen ton antipalon tou anthropou, ouk an dikaios enikethe ho
   echthros, palin te, ei me ho Theos edoresato ten soterian, ouk an
   bebaios echoimen auten, kai ei me sunenothe ho anthropos to Theo ouk an
   edunethe metaschein tes aphtharsias. Edei gar ton mesiten tou Theou te
   kai anthropon, dia tes idias pros hekaterous oikeiotetos eis philian
   kai homonoian tous anphoterous sunagagein. Words plainly divine; an
   illustrious testimony of the faith of the ancient church, and
   expressive of the principal mystery of the gospel! "Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as we
   said before, he united man to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. For if man had not overcome the
   adversary of men, the enemy had not been justly conquered; and, on the
   other hand, if God had not given and granted salvation, we could never
   have a firm, indefeasible possession of it; and if man had not been
   united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, he could not have been partaker of immortality. It
   behoved, therefore, the Mediator between God and man, by his own
   participation of the nature of each of them, to bring them both into
   friendship and agreement with each other." And to the same purpose,
   speaking of the wisdom of God in our redemption by Christ, with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the conquest of the devil: (lib v. cap. 1:) "Potens in omnibus Dei
   Verbum, et non deficiens in su� justiti�, juste etiam adversus ipsam
   conversus est apostasiam, ea qu� sunt sua redimens, ab eo, non cum vi,
   quemadmodum ille initio dominabatur nostri, ea qu� non erant sua
   insatiabiliter rapiens.... Suo igitur sanguine redimente nos Domino, et
   dante animam suam pro anima nostra, et carnem suam pro carnibus
   nostris," etc.. Again divinely: "The all-powerful Word of God, no way
   defective in righteousness, set himself against the apostasy justly
   also; redeeming from him (Satan, the head of the apostasy) the things
   which were his own -- not with force, as he bare rule over us,
   insatiably making rapine of what was not his own -- but he, the Lord,
   redeeming us with his own blood, giving his soul for our soul, and his
   flesh for ours, wrought out our deliverance." These things are at large
   insisted on in the ending discourse.
				</p><p>
   It belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this great mystery, and is a fruit of divine wisdom,
   that our deliverance should be wrought in and by the same nature
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> and through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we were ruined. The reasons of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, and the glory
   of God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, are at large discoursed in the ensuing treatise. To the
   same purpose speaks the same holy writer: (lib v. cap. 14:) "Non in
   semetipso recapitulasset h�c Dominus, nisi ipse caro et sanguis
   secundum principalem plasmationem factus fuisset; salvans in semetipso
   in fine illud quod perierat in principio in Adam. Si autem ob aliam
   quandam dispositionem Dominus incarnatus est, et ex alter� substanti�
   carnem attulit, non ergo in semetipso recapitulatus est hominem, adhuc
   etiam nec caro quidem dici potest.... Habuit ergo et ipse carnem et
   sanguinem, non alteram quandam, sed ipsam principalem Patris
   plasmationem in se recapitulans, exquirens id quod perierat." And to
   the same purpose: (lib. v. cap. 1:) "Neque enim vere esset sanguinem et
   carnem habens, per quam nos redemit, nisi antiquam plasmationem Ad� in
   seipsum recapitulasset." That which these passages give testimony to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>,
   is what we have discoursed concerning the necessity of our redemption
   in and by the nature that sinned; and yet withal, that it should be
   free from all that contagion which invaded our nature by the fall. And
   these things are divinely expressed. "Our Lord," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "had not
   gathered up these things in himself, had not he been made flesh and
   blood, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its original creation." (The reader may observe,
   that none of the ancient writers do so frequently express the fall of
   Adam by our apostasy from God, and our recovery by a recapitulation in
   Christ, as Iren�us -- his recapitulation being nothing but the
   anakephalaiosis mentioned by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference> -- and he here
   affirms, that, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end, the Lord was made flesh; "secundum
   principalem plasmationem," as his words are rendered; that is plainly,
   the original creation of our nature in innocence, uprightness, purity,
   and righteousness.) "So he saved in himself in the end, what perished
   in Adam at the beginning." (The same nature, in and by the same
   nature.) "For if the Lord had been incarnate for any other
   disposition," (i.e., cause, reason, or end,) "and had brought flesh
   from any other substance," (i.e., celestial or ethereal, as the
   Gnostics imagined,) "he had not recovered men, brought our nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   a head in himself, nor could he have been said to be flesh. He
   therefore himself had flesh and blood not of any other kind; but he
   took to himself that which was originally created of the Father,
   seeking that which was lost." The same is observed by Augustine: (Lib.
   de Fide, ad Petrum Diaconum:) "Sic igitur Christum Dei Filium, id est,
   unam ex Trinitate personam, Deum verum crede, ut divinitatem ejus de
   natur� Patris natam esse non dubites; et sic eum verum hominem crede,
   et ejus carnem, non coelestis, non aeri�, non alterius cujusquam putes
   esse natur�, sed ejus cujus est omnium caro; id est, quam ipse Deus,
   homini primo de terra plasmavit, et c�teris hominibus plasmat." -- "So
   believe Christ the Son of God, that is, one person of the Trinity, to
   be the true God, that you doubt not but that his divinity was born" (by
   eternal generation) "of the nature of the Father; and so believe him to
   be a true man, that you suppose not his flesh to be aerial, or
   heavenly, or of any other nature, but of that which is the flesh of
   men; that is, which God himself formed in the first man of the earth,
   and which he forms in all other men." That which he speaks of one
   person of the Trinity, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the heretical opinion of
   Hormisdas, the bishop of Rome, who contended that it was unlawful to
   say that one person of the Trinity was incarnate, and persecuted some
   Scythian monks, men not unlearned about it, who were strenuously
   defended by Maxentius, one of them.
				</p><p>
   It carries<note n="carrieth">Auto-modernized</note> in it a great condecency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom, that man
   should be restored to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the image of God by him who was the essential
   image of the Father; (as is declared in our discourse;) and that he was
   made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, that we might be made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God
   through him. So speaks the same Iren�us: (lib. v. Pr�fat:) "Verbum Dei
   Jesus Christus, qui propter immensam suam dilectionem, factus est quod
   sumus nos, ut nos perficeret quod est ipse." -- "Jesus Christ, the Word
   of God, who, from his own infinite love, was made what we are, that he
   might make us what he is;" that is, by the restoration of the image of
   God in us. And again: (lib. iii. cap. 20:) "Filius Dei existens semper
   apud Patrem, et homo factus, longam hominum expositionem in seipso
   recapitulavit; in compendio nobis salutem pr�stans, ut quod
   perdideramus in Adam, id est, secundum imaginem et similitudinem esse
   Dei, hoc in Christo Jesus reciperemus. Quia enim non erat possibile,
   eum hominem, qui semel victus fuerat et elisus per inobedientiam,
   replasmare et obtinere brabium (brabeion) victori�; iterum autem
   impossibile erat ut salutem perciperet, qui sub peccato ceciderat.
   Utraque operatus est filius Verbum Dei existens, a Patre descendens et
   incarnatus, et usque ad mortem descendens, et dispensationem consummans
   salutis nostr�." -- "Being the Son of God always with the Father, and
   being made man, he reconciled or gathered up in himself the
   long-continued exposing of men," (to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sin and judgment,) "bringing in
   salvation in this compendious way, (in this summary of it,) that what
   we had lost in Adam -- that is, our being in the image and likeness of
   God -- we should recover in Christ. For it was not possible that man
   that had been once conquered and broken by disobedience, should by
   himself be reformed, and obtain the crown of victory; nor, again, was
   it possible that he should recover salvation who had fallen under sin.
   Both were wrought by the Son, the Word of God, who, descending from the
   Father, and being incarnate, submitted himself to death, perfecting the
   dispensation of our salvation."
				</p><p>
   And Clemens Alexandrinus to the same purpose: (Adhort. ad Gentes.) Nai
   phemi ho logos ho tou Theou anthropos genomenos, hina de kai su para
   anthropou mathes, te pote ara anthropos genetai Theos. -- "The Word of
   God was made man, that thou mightest learn of a man how man may become"
   (as) "God." And Ambrose, in Ps. cxviii. Octonar. decim.: [of the
   authorized English version, <reference osisRef="Ps.119.73">Psalms 119:73</reference>:] "Imago, [id est, Verbum
   Dei,] ad eum qui est ad imaginem, [hoc est, hominem,] venit, et qu�rit
   imago eum qui est ad similitudinem sui, ut iterum signet, ut iterum
   confirmet, quia amiseras quod accepisti." -- "The image of God, that
   is, the Word of God, came to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who was after the image of God, that
   is man. And this image of God seeks him who was after the image of God,
   that he might seal him with it again, and confirm him, because thou
   hadst lost that which thou hadst received." And Augustine in one
   instance gives a rational account why it was condecent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine
   wisdom that the Son, and not the Father or the Holy Spirit, should be
   incarnate -- which we also inquire into: (Lib. de Definitionibus
   Orthodox� Fidei sive de Ecclesiastica Dogmatibus, cap. ii.:) "Non Pater
   carnem assumpsit, neque Spiritus Sanctus, set Filius tantum; ut qui
   erat in divinitate Dei Patris Filius, ipse fieret in homine hominis
   matris Filius; ne Filii nomen ad alterum transiret, qui non esset
   �tern� nativitate filius." -- "The Father did not assume flesh, nor the
   Holy Spirit, but the Son only; that he who in the Deity was the Son of
   the Father, should be made the Son of man, in his mother of human race;
   that the name of the Son should not pass to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any other, who was not
   the Son by an eternal nativity."
				</p><p>
   I shall close with one meditation of the same author, concerning the
   wisdom and righteousness of God in this mystery: (Enchirid. ad
   Laurent., cap. xcix.:) "Vide -- universum genus humanum tam justo
   judicio Divino in apostatic� radice damnatum, ut etiam si nullus inde
   liberaretur, nemo recte possit Dei vituperare justitiam; et qui
   liberantur, sic oportuisse liberari, ut ex pluribus non liberatis,
   atque in damnatione justissim� derelictis, ostenderetur, quod meruisset
   universa conspersio, et qu� etiam istos debitum judicium Dei duceret,
   nisi ejus indebita misericordia subveniret." -- "Behold, the whole race
   of mankind, by the just judgment of God, so condemned in the
   apostatical root, that if no one were thence delivered, yet no man
   could rightly complain of the justice of God; and that those who are
   freed, ought so to be freed, that, from the greater number who are not
   freed, but left under most righteous condemnation, it might be manifest
   what the whole mass had deserved, and whither the judgment of God due
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them would lead them, if his mercy, which was not due, did not
   relieve them." The reader may see what is discoursed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these
   purposes: and because the great end of the description given of the
   person of Christ, is that we may love him, and thereby be transformed
   into his image, I shall close this preface with the words of Jerome,
   concerning that divine love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ which is at large declared.
   "Sive legas," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "sive scribas, sive vigiles, sive dormias, amor
   tibi semper buccina in auribus sonet, hic lituus excitet animam tuam,
   hoc amore furibundus; qu�re in lectulo tuo, quem desiderat anima tua:"
   Epist. lxvi. ad Pammach., cap. 10. -- "Whether thou readest or writest,
   whether thou watchest or sleepest, let the voice of love (to Christ)
   sound in thine ears; let this trumpet stir up thy soul: being
   overpowered (brought into an ecstasy) with this love, seek Him on thy
   bed whom thy soul desires<note n="desireth">Auto-modernized</note> and longs<note n="longeth">Auto-modernized</note> for."

<p>   Peter's Confession; <reference osisRef="Matt.16.16">Matthew 16:16</reference> -- Conceits of the Papists upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> --
   The Substance and Excellency of that Confession.
				</p><p>
   Our blessed Saviour, inquiring of his disciples their apprehensions
   concerning his person, and their faith in him, Simon Peter -- as he was
   usually the forwardest on all such occasions, through his peculiar
   endowments of faith and zeal -- returns an answer in the name of them
   all, <reference osisRef="Matt.16.16">Matthew 16:16</reference>: "And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the
   Christ, the Son of the living God."
				</p><p>
   Baronius, and sundry others of the Roman Church, do all affirm that the
   Lord Christ did in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> prescribe the form of a general council. "For
   here," say they, "the principal article of our Christian faith was
   declared and determined by Peter, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> all the rest of the
   apostles, as in duty they were obliged, did give their consent and
   suffrage." This was done, as they suppose, that a rule and law might be
   given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> future ages, how to enact and determine articles of faith.
   For it is to be done by the successors of Peter presiding in councils,
   as it was now done by Peter in this assembly of Christ and his
   apostles.
				</p><p>
   But they seem to forget that Christ himself was now present, and
   therefore could have no vicar, seeing he presided in his own person.
   All the claim they lay to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the necessity of such a visible head of the
   church on the earth, as may determine articles of faith, is from the
   absence of Christ since his ascension into heaven. But that he should
   also have a substitute whilst he was present, is somewhat uncouth; and
   whilst they live, they shall never make the pope president where Christ
   is present. The truth is, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not propose to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples the
   framing of an article of truth, but inquires after their own faith,
   which they expressed in this confession. Such things as these will
   prejudice, carnal interest, and the prepossession of the minds of men
   with corrupt imaginations, cause them to adventure on, to the scandal,
   yea, ruin of religion!
				</p><p>
   This short but illustrious confession of Peter, comprises<note n="compriseth">Auto-modernized</note> eminently
   the whole truth concerning the person and office of Christ:  of his
   person, in that although he was the Son of man, (under which
   appellation he made his inquiry, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of
   man, am?") yet was he not only so, but the eternal Son of the living
   God:  of his office, that he was the Christ, he whom God had anointed
   to be the Saviour of the church, in the discharge of his kingly,
   priestly, and prophetical power. Instances of the like brief
   confessions we have elsewhere in the Scripture. <reference osisRef="Rom.10.9">Romans 10:9</reference>: "If thou
   shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
   heart that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." <reference osisRef="1John.4.2 1John.4.3">1 John 4:2-3</reference>: "Every spirit that confesses<note n="confesseth">Auto-modernized</note> that Jesus Christ is come
   in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesses<note n="confesseth">Auto-modernized</note> not that Jesus
   Christ is come in the flesh is not of God." And it is manifest, that
   all divine truths have such a concatenation among themselves, and do
   all of them so centre in the person of Christ -- as vested with his
   offices towards the church -- that they are all virtually comprised in
   this confession, and they will be so as counted by all who destroy them
   not by contrary errors and imaginations inconsistent with them, though
   it be the duty of all men to obtain the express knowledge of them in
   particular, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the means of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> which they do enjoy. The
   danger of men's souls lies<note n="lieth">Auto-modernized</note> not in a disability to attain a
   comprehension of longer or more subtile confessions of faith, but in
   embracing things contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, or inconsistent with, this foundation
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Whatever it be through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> men cease to hold the Head, how small
   soever it seem, that alone is pernicious: <reference osisRef="Col.2.18 Col.2.19">Colossians 2:18-19</reference>
				</p><p>
   This confession, therefore, -- as containing the sum and substance of
   that faith which they were called to give testimony to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and
   concerning which their trial was approaching -- is approved by our
   Saviour. And not only so, but eminent privileges are granted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   that made it, and in him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole church, that should live in the
   same faith and confession: verses 17, 18. "And Jesus answered and said
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   not revealed it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say
   also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
   church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
				</p><p>
   Two things does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> our Saviour consider in the answer returned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   inquiry. 1. The faith of Peter in this confession -- the faith of him
   that made it; 2. The nature and truth of the confession: both which are
   required in all the disciples of Christ -- "For with the heart man
   believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> salvation:" <reference osisRef="Rom.10.10">Romans 10:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   1. The first thing which he speaks to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> is the faith of Peter, who made
   this confession. Without this no outward confession is of any use or
   advantage. For even the devils knew him to be the Holy One of God; <reference osisRef="Luke.4.34">Luke 4:34</reference>; yet would he not permit them to speak it: <reference osisRef="Mark.1.34">Mark 1:34</reference> That
   which gives glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in any confession, and which gives us an
   interest in the truth confessed, is the believing of the heart, which
   is to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> righteousness. With respect to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ speaks:
   verse 17. "And Jesus answered and said to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, Blessed art thou,
   Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not revealed it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> thee, but
   my Father which is in heaven."
				</p><p>
   He commends and sets forth the faith of Peter -- (1.) From its effect;
   (2.) From its cause. Its effect was, that it made him blessed in whom
   it was. For it is not only a blessed thing to believe and know Jesus
   Christ, as it is called life eternal; <reference osisRef="John.17.3">John 17:3</reference>; but it is that
   which gives an immediate interest in the blessed state of adoption,
   justification, and acceptance with God: <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference> (2.) The immediate
   cause of this faith is divine revelation. It is not the effect or
   product of our own abilities, the best of which are but flesh and
   blood. That faith which renders them blessed in whom it is, is wrought
   in them by the power of God revealing Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their souls. Those
   who have more abilities of their own to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end than Peter had, we
   are not concerned in.
				</p><p>
   2. He speaks to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the confession itself, acquainting his disciples with
   the nature and use of it, which, from the beginning, he principally
   designed: verse 18. "And I say also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> thee, that thou art Peter, and
   upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
   prevail against it."
				</p><p>
   From the speaking of these words to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Peter, there is a controversy
   raised in the world, whether the Lord Christ himself, or the pope of
   Rome, be the rock whereon the church is built. And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that state are
   things come in religion, among them that are called Christians, that
   the greatest number are for the pope and against Christ in this matter.
   And they have good reason for their choice. For if Christ be the rock
   whereon the church is built, whereas he is a living stone, those that
   are laid and built on him must be lively stones also, as this apostle
   assures us, <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.4 1Pet.2.5">1 Peter 2:4-5</reference>, they must be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ himself,
   partaking of his nature, quickened by his Spirit, so, as it were, to be
   bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh: <reference osisRef="Eph.5.30">Ephesians 5:30</reference> Nor can any be
   built on him but by a living faith, effectual in universal obedience.
   These things the generality of men like not at all; and, therefore, the
   fabric of the living temple on this foundation is usually but small,
   seldom conspicuous or outwardly glorious. But if the pope be this rock,
   all the Papists in the world, or all that have a mind so to be -- be
   they ever so wicked and ungodly -- may be built upon him, and be made
   partakers of all that deliverance from the powers of hell which that
   rock can afford them. And all this may be obtained at a very easy rate;
   for the acknowledgment of the pope's sovereign authority in the church
   is all that is required to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. How they bring in the claim of their
   pope by Peter, his being at Rome, being bishop of Rome, dying at Rome,
   fixing his chair at Rome, devoting and transmitting all his right,
   title, power, and authority, every thing but his faith, holiness, and
   labour in the ministry, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the pope, I shall not here inquire; I have
   done it elsewhere. Here is fixed the root of the tree, which is grown
   great, like that in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, until it is become a
   receptacle for the beasts of the field and fowls of the air -- sensual
   men and unclean spirits. I shall, therefore, briefly lay an axe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the root of it, by evidencing that it is not the person of Peter who
   confessed Christ, but the person of Christ whom Peter confessed, that
   is the rock on which the church is built.
				</p><p>
   1. The variation of the expressions proves undeniably that our Saviour
   intended we should not understand the person of Peter to be the rock.
   He takes occasion from his name to declare what he designed, but no
   more: "And I say also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> thee, Thou art Peter." He had given him this
   name before, at his first calling, <reference osisRef="John.1.42">John 1:42</reference> Now he gives the reason
   of his so doing; viz., because of the illustrious confession that he
   should make of the rock of the church; as the name of God under the Old
   Testament was called on persons, and things, and places, because of
   some special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the expression is varied on
   purpose to declare, that whatever be the signification of the name
   Peter, yet the person so called was not the rock intended. The words
   are, Su ei Petros, kai epi taute te petra. Had he intended the person
   of Peter, he would have expressed it plainly, Su ei petros, kai epi
   soi, k. t. l. -- "Thou art a rock, and on thee will I build." At least
   the gender had not been altered, but he would have said, Epi touto to
   petro, which would have given some colour to this imagination. The
   exception which they lay to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, from the use of Cephas in the
   Syriac, which was the name of Peter, and signified a rock or a stone,
   lies not only against the authentic authority of the Greek original,
   but of their own translation of it, which reads the words, "Tu es
   Petrus, et super hanc petram."
				</p><p>
   2. If the church was built on the person of Peter, then when he died
   the church must utterly fail. For no building can possibly abide when
   its foundation is removed and taken away. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> they tell us they
   do not intend by the person of Peter, that singular and individual
   person alone to be this rock; but that he and his successors the
   bishops of Rome are so. But this story of his successors at Rome is a
   shameful fable. If the pope of Rome be a true believer, he succeeds, in
   common with all other believers, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the privileges which belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   this confession; if he be not, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> neither lot nor portion in this
   matter. But the pretence is utterly vain on another account also. The
   apostle, showing the insufficiency of the Aaronical priesthood --
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there was a succession of God's own appointment -- affirms,
   that it could not bring the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a perfect state, because the
   high priests died one after another, and so were many: <reference osisRef="Heb.7.8 Heb.7.23 Heb.7.24">Hebrews 7:8, 23-24</reference> And upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> he shows that the church cannot be consummated or
   perfected, unless it rest wholly in and on him who lives forever, and
   was made a priest "after the power of an endless life." And if the Holy
   Ghost judged the state of the Jewish Church to be weak and imperfect --
   because it rested on high priests that died one after another, although
   their succession was expressly ordained of God himself -- shall we
   suppose that the Lord Christ, who came to consummate the church, and to
   bring it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the most perfect estate of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> in this world it is
   capable, should build it on a succession of dying men, concerning which
   succession there is not the least intimation that it is appointed of
   God? And as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the matter of fact, we know both what interruptions it
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> received, and what monsters it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> produced -- both sufficiently
   manifesting that it is not of God.
				</p><p>
   3. There is but one rock, but one foundation. There is no mention in
   the Scripture of two rocks of the church. In what others invent to this
   purpose we are not concerned. And the rock and the foundation are the
   same; for the rock is that whereon the church is built, that is the
   foundation. But that the Lord Christ is this single rock and foundation
   of the church, we shall prove immediately. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, neither Peter
   himself, nor his pretended successors, can be this rock. As for any
   other rock, it belongs not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our religion; they that have framed it
   may use it as they please. For they that make such things are like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the things they make; so is every one that trusts<note n="trusteth">Auto-modernized</note> in them: <reference osisRef="Ps.115.8">Psalms 115:8</reference> "But their rock is not as our rock, themselves being judges;" unless
   they will absolutely equal the pope to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   4. Immediately after this declaration of our Saviour's purpose to build
   his church on the rock, he reveals to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples the way and
   manner how he would lay its foundation, viz., in his death and
   sufferings, verse 21. And upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> this supposed rock, being a little
   left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own stability, showed himself to be but a "reed shaken
   with the wind." For he is so far from putting himself under the weight
   of the building, that he attempts an obstruction of its foundation. He
   began to rebuke Christ himself for mentioning his sufferings, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   alone the foundation of the Gospel Church was to be laid, verse 22. And
   upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> he received the severest rebuke that ever the Lord Jesus gave
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any of his disciples, verse 23. And so it is known that afterward
   -- through surprisal and temptation -- he did what lay in him to recall
   that confession which here he made, and whereon the church was to be
   built. For, that no flesh might glory in itself, he that was singular
   in this confession of Christ, was so also in the denial of him. And if
   he in his own person manifested how unmeet he was to be the foundation
   of the church, they must be strangely infatuated who can suppose his
   pretended successors so to be. But some men will rather have the church
   to be utterly without any foundation, than that it should not be the
   pope.
				</p><p>
   The vanity of this pretence being removed, the substance of the great
   mystery contained in the attestation given by our Saviour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   confession of Peter, and the promise to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> annexed, may be
   comprised in the ensuing assertions: 
				</p><p>
   1. The person of Christ, the Son of the living God, as vested with his
   offices, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he was called and anointed, is the foundation of the
   church, the rock whereon it is built.
				</p><p>
   2. The power and policy of hell will be always engaged in opposition
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the relation of the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this foundation, or the building
   of it on this rock.
				</p><p>
   3. The church that is built on this rock shall never be disjoined from
   it, or prevailed against by the opposition of the gates of hell.
				</p><p>
   The two former of these I shall speak briefly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, my principal design
   being the demonstration of a truth that arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from the consideration
   of them all.
				</p><p>
   The foundation of the church is twofold: (1.) Real; (2.) Doctrinal. And
   in both ways, Christ alone is the foundation. The real foundation of
   the church he is, by virtue of the mystical union of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, with
   all the benefits of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>, from thence and thereby, it is made partaker.
   For thence alone has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it spiritual life, grace, mercy, perfection, and
   glory: <reference osisRef="Eph.4.15 Eph.4.16">Ephesians 4:15-16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.2.19">Colossians 2:19</reference> And he is the doctrinal foundation
   of it, in that the faith or doctrine concerning him and his offices is
   that divine truth which in a peculiar manner animates and constitutes
   the church of the New Testament: <reference osisRef="Eph.2.19 Eph.2.20 Eph.2.21 Eph.2.22">Ephesians 2:19-22</reference> Without the faith and
   confession of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, no one person belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that church. I know not
   what is now believed, but I judge it will not yet be denied, that the
   external formal cause of the Church of the New Testament, is the
   confession of the faith concerning the person, offices, and grace of
   Christ, with what is of us required upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. In what sense we assert
   these things will be afterwards fully cleared.
				</p><p>
   That the Lord Christ is thus the foundation of the church, is testified
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Isa.28.16">Isaiah 28:16</reference>: "Thus says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion
   for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure
   foundation: he that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> shall not make haste." It is among the
   bold inroads that in this late age have been made on the vitals of
   religion, that some, in compliance with the Jews, have attempted the
   application of this promise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Hezekiah. The violence they have
   offered in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> to the mind of the Holy Ghost, might be evidenced from
   every word of the context. But the interpretation and application of
   the last words of this promise by the apostles, leaves no pretence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   this insinuation. "He that believes on him shall not be ashamed" or
   "confounded," <reference osisRef="Rom.9.33">Romans 9:33</reference>; x. 11; <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.6">1 Peter 2:6</reference>; that is, he shall be
   eternally saved -- which it is the highest blasphemy to apply to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any
   other but Jesus Christ alone. He, therefore, is alone that foundation
   which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> laid in and of the church. See <reference osisRef="Ps.118.22">Psalms 118:22</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.21.42">Matthew 21:42</reference>; <reference osisRef="Mark.12.10">Mark 12:10</reference>; <reference osisRef="Luke.20.17">Luke 20:17</reference>; <reference osisRef="Acts.4.11">Acts 4:11</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.4">1 Peter 2:4</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.2.20 Eph.2.21 Eph.2.22">Ephesians 2:20-22</reference>; <reference osisRef="Zech.3.9">Zechariah 3:9</reference> But this fundamental truth -- of Christ being the
   only foundation of the church -- is so expressly determined by the
   apostle Paul, as not to need any farther confirmation, <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.11">1 Corinthians 3:11</reference>:
   "For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
   Christ."

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 2 Opposition made to the Church as built upon the Person of Christ">
<title>Chapter 2 Opposition made to the Church as built upon the Person of Christ.</title>
<p>   There are in the words of our Saviour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Peter concerning the
   foundation of the church, a promise of its preservation, and a
   prediction of the opposition that should be made to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. And,
   accordingly, all things are come to pass, and carrying on towards a
   complete accomplishment. For (that we may begin with the opposition
   foretold) the power and policy of hell ever were, and ever will be,
   engaged in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church built on this foundation -- that
   is, the faith of it concerning his person, office, and grace, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   it is built on him. This, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what is past, concerns<note n="concerneth">Auto-modernized</note> matter of
   fact, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>, therefore, I must give a brief account; and then we
   shall examine what evidences we have of the same endeavour at present.
				</p><p>
   The gates of hell, as all agree, are the power and policy of it, or the
   actings of Satan, both as a lion and as a serpent, by rage and by
   subtlety. But whereas in these things he acts not visibly in his own
   person, but by his agents, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> always had two sorts of them
   employed in his service. By the one he executes his rage, and by the
   other his craft; he animates the one as a lion, the other as a serpent.
   In the one he acts as the dragon, in the other as the beast that had
   two horns like the lamb, but spake like the dragon. The first is the
   unbelieving world; the other, apostates and seducers of all sorts.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, this work is this kind is of a double nature; -- the one, an
   effect of his power and rage, acted by the world in persecution -- the
   other, of his policy and craft, acted by heretics in seduction. In both
   he designs to separate the church from its foundation.
				</p><p>
   The opposition of the first sort he began against the person of Christ
   immediately in his human nature. Fraud first he once attempted in his
   temptation, (Matt. iv,) but quickly found that that way he could make
   no approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. The prince of this world came, but had nothing in
   him. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he betook himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> open force, and, by all means
   possible, sought his destruction. So also the more at any time the
   church is by faith and watchfulness secured against seduction, the more
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he rage against it in open persecution. And (for the example and
   comfort of the church in its conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ) no means were left
   unattempted that might instigate and prepare the world for his ruin.
   Reproaches, contempt, scorn, false and lying accusations -- by his
   suggestions -- were heaped on him on every hand. Hereby, in the whole
   course of his ministry, he "endured the contradiction of sinners
   against himself:" <reference osisRef="Heb.12.3">Hebrews 12:3</reference> And there is in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> blessed provision
   made of inestimable consolation, for all those who are "predestinated
   to be conformed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his image," when God shall help them by faith to
   make use of his example. He calls them to take up his cross and follow
   him; and he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> showed them what is in it, by his own bearing of it.
   Contempt, reproach, despiteful usage, calumnies, false accusations,
   wrestings of his words, blaspheming of his doctrine, reviling of his
   person, all that he said and did as to his principles about human
   government and moral conversation, encompassed him all his days. And he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> assured his followers, that such, and no other, (at least for the
   most part,) shall be their lot in this world. And some in all ages have
   an experience of it in an eminent manner. But have they any reason to
   complain? Why should the servant look for better measure than the
   Master met withal? To be made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in the worst of evils, for
   his sake, is the best and most honourable condition in this world. God
   help some to believe it! Hereby was way made for his death. But, in the
   whole, it was manifested how infinitely, in all his subtlety and
   malice, Satan falls short of the contrivances of divine wisdom and
   power. For all that he attained by effecting his death, in the hour of
   darkness, was but the breaking of his own head, the destruction of his
   works, with the ruin of his kingdom; and what yet remains to consummate
   his eternal misery, he shall himself work out in his opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the church. His restless malice and darkness will not suffer him to
   give over the pursuit of his rage, until nothing remains to give him a
   full entrance into endless torments -- which he hastens<note n="hasteneth">Auto-modernized</note> every day.
   For when he shall have filled up the measure of his sins, and of the
   sins of the world in being instrumental to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his rage, eternal judgment
   shall put all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their issue. Through that shall he, with the
   world, enter into everlasting flames -- and the whole church, built on
   the rock, into rest and glory.
				</p><p>
   No sooner did the Church of the New Testament begin to arise on this
   foundation, but the whole world of Jews and Gentiles set themselves
   with open force to destroy it. And all that they contended with the
   church about, was their faith and confession of it, that "Jesus was the
   Christ, the Son of the living God." This foundation they would cast it
   from, or exterminate it out of the earth. What were the endeavours of
   the gates of hell in this kind -- with what height of rage, with what
   bloody and inhuman cruelties they were exercised and executed -- we
   have some obscure remembrance, in the stories that remain from the
   martyrdom of Stephen to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the days of Constantine. But although there
   be enough remaining on record, to give us a view of the insatiable
   malice of the old murderer, and an astonishing representation of human
   nature degenerating into his image in the perpetration of all horrid,
   inhuman cruelties -- yet is it all as nothing in comparison of that
   prospect which the last day will give of them, when the earth shall
   disclose all the blood that it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> received, and the righteous Judge
   shall lay open all the contrivances for its effusion, with the rage and
   malice with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> they were attended. The same rage continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> yet
   unallayed in its principles. And although God in many places restrain
   and shut it up in his providence, by the circumstances of human
   affairs, yet -- as it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the least advantage, as it finds any door
   open to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it -- it endeavours to act itself in lesser or higher
   degrees. But whatever dismal appearance of things there may be in the
   world, we need not fear the ruin of the church by the most bloody
   oppositions. Former experiences will give security against future
   events. It is built on the rock, and those gates of hell shall not
   prevail against it.
				</p><p>
   The second way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> Satan attempted the same end, and yet continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note>
   so to do, was by pernicious errors and heresies. For all the heresies
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> the church was assaulted and pestered for some centuries of
   years, were oppositions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their faith in the person of Christ. I
   shall briefly reflect on the heads of this opposition, because they are
   now, after a revolution of so many ages, lifting up themselves again,
   though under new vizards and pretences. And they were of three sorts: 
				</p><p>
   1. That which introduced other doctrines and notions of divine things,
   absolutely exclusive of the person and mediation of Christ. Such was
   that of the Gnostic, begun as it is supposed by Simon the magician. A
   sort of people they were, with whom the first churches, after the
   decease of the apostles, were exceedingly pestered, and the faith of
   many was overthrown. For instead of Christ and God in him reconciling
   the world to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, and the obedience of faith upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> according
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Gospel, they introduced endless fables, genealogies, and
   conjugations of deities, or divine powers; which practically issued in
   this, that Christ was such an emanation of light and knowledge in them
   as made them perfect -- that is, it took away all differences of good
   and evil, and gave them liberty to do what they pleased, without sense
   of sin, or danger of punishment. This was the first way that Satan
   attempted the faith of the church, viz., by substituting a perfecting
   light and knowledge in the room of the person of Christ. And, for aught
   I know, it may be one of the last ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he will endeavour the
   accomplishment of the same design. Nor had I made mention of these
   pernicious imaginations which have lain rotting in oblivion for so many
   generations, but that some again endeavour to revive them, at least so
   far as they were advanced and directed against the faith and knowledge
   of the person of Christ.
				</p><p>
   2. Satan attempted the same work by them who denied his divine nature
   -- that is, in effect, denied him to be the Son of the living God, on
   the faith of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the church is built. And these were of two sorts: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) Such as plainly and openly denied him to have any pre-existence
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his conception and birth of the holy Virgin. Such were the
   Ebionites, Samosatanians, and Photinians. For they all affirmed him to
   be a mere man, and no more, though miraculously conceived and born of
   the Virgin, as some of them granted; (though denied, as it is said, by
   the Ebionites;) on which account he was called the Son of God. This
   attempt lay directly against the everlasting rock, and would have
   substituted sand in the room of it. For no better is the best of human
   nature to make a foundation for the church, if not united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   divine. Many in those days followed those pernicious ways; yet the
   foundation of God stood sure, nor was the church moved from it. But
   yet, after a revolution of so many ages, is the same endeavour again
   engaged in. The old enemy, taking advantage of the prevalence of
   Atheism and profaneness among those that are called Christians, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   again employ the same engine to overthrow the faith of the church --
   and that with more subtlety than formerly -- in the Socinians. For
   their faith, or rather unbelief, concerning the person of Christ, is
   the same with those before mentioned. And what a vain, wanton
   generation admire and applaud in their sophistical reasonings, is no
   more but what the primitive church triumphed over through faith, in the
   most subtle management of the Samosatanians, Photinians, and others. An
   evidence it is that Satan is not unknowing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the workings of that
   vanity and darkness, of those corrupt affections in the minds of men,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they are disposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a contempt of the mystery of the Gospel.
   Who would have thought that the old exploded pernicious errors of the
   Samosatanians, Photinians, and Pelagians, against the power and grace
   of Christ, should enter on the world again with so much ostentation and
   triumph as they do at this day? But many men, so far as I can observe,
   are fallen into such a dislike of the Christ of God, that every thing
   concerning his person, Spirit, and grace, is an abomination to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
   It is not want of understanding to comprehend doctrines, but hatred
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the things themselves, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> such persons are seduced. And there
   is nothing of this nature to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> nature, as corrupted, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   contribute its utmost assistance.
				</p><p>
   (2.) There were such as opposed his divine nature, under pretence of
   declaring it another way than the faith of the church did rest in. So
   was it with the Arians, in whom the gates of hell seemed once to be
   near a prevalency. For the whole professing world almost was once
   surprised into that heresy. In words they acknowledged his divine
   person; but added, as a limitation of that acknowledgment, that the
   divine nature which he had was originally created of God, and produced
   out of nothing; with a double blasphemy, denying him to be the true
   God, and making a god of a mere creature. But in all these attempts,
   the opposition of the gates of hell to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church respected faith in
   the person of Christ as the Son of the living God.
				</p><p>
   (3.) By some his human nature was opposed -- for no stone did Satan
   leave unturned in the pursuit of his great design. And that which in
   all these things he aimed at, was the substitution of a false Christ in
   the room of Him who, in one person, was both the Son of man and the Son
   of the living God. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he infected the minds of men with endless
   imaginations. Some denied him to have any real human nature, but
   [alleged him] to have been a phantasm, an appearance, a dispensation, a
   mere cloud acted by divine power; some, that he was made of heavenly
   flesh, brought from above, and which (as some also affirmed) was a
   parcel of the divine nature. Some affirmed that his body was not
   animated, as ours are, by a rational soul, but was immediately acted by
   the power of the Divine Being, which was to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it in the room of a
   living soul; some, that his body was of an ethereal nature, and was at
   length turned into the sun; with many such diabolical delusions. And
   there yet want not attempts, in these days, of various sorts, to
   destroy the verity of his human nature; and I know not what some late
   fantastical opinions about the nature of glorified bodies may tend
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. The design of Satan, in all these pernicious imaginations, is to
   break the cognation and alliance between Christ in his human nature and
   the church, whereon the salvation of it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> absolutely depend.
				</p><p>
   3. He raised a vehement opposition against the hypostatical union, or
   the union of these two natures in one person. This he did in the
   Nestorian heresy, which greatly, and for a long time, pestered the
   church. The authors and promoters of this opinion granted the Lord
   Christ to have a divine nature, to be the Son of the living God. They
   also acknowledged the truth of his human nature, that he was truly a
   man, even as we are. But the personal union between these two natures
   they denied. A union, they said, there was between them, but such as
   consisted only in love, power, and care. God did, as they imagined,
   eminently and powerfully manifest himself in the man Christ Jesus --
   had him in a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> regard and love, and did act in him more than in
   any other. But that the Son of God assumed our nature into personal
   subsistence with himself -- through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> whole Christ was one person, and
   all his mediatory acts were the acts of that one person, of him who was
   both God and man -- this they would not acknowledge. And this
   pernicious imagination, though it seem to make great concessions of
   truth, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> no less effectually evert the foundation of the church than
   the former. For, if the divine and human nature of Christ do not
   constitute one individual person, all that he did for us was only as a
   man -- which would have been altogether insufficient for the salvation
   of the church, nor had God redeemed it with his own blood. This seems
   to be the opinion of some amongst us, at this day, about the person of
   Christ. They acknowledge the being of the eternal Word, the Son of God;
   and they allow in the like manner the verity of his human nature, or
   own that man Christ Jesus. Only they say, that the eternal Word was in
   him and with him, in the same kind as it is with other believers, but
   in a supreme degree of manifestation and power. But, though in these
   things there is a great endeavour to put a new colour and appearance on
   old imaginations, the design of Satan is one and the same in them all,
   viz., to oppose the building of the church upon its proper, sole
   foundation. And these things shall be afterwards expressly spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   I intend no more in these instances but briefly to demonstrate, that
   the principal opposition of the gates of hell to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church lay
   always to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the building of it, by faith, on the person of Christ.
				</p><p>
   It were easy also to demonstrate that Mohammedanism, which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been so
   sore a stroke to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Christian profession, is nothing but a
   concurrence and combination of these two ways, of force and fraud, in
   opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ.
				</p><p>
   It is true that Satan, after all this, by another way, attempted the
   doctrine of the offices and grace of Christ, with the worship of God in
   him. And this he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> carried so far, as that it issued in a fatal
   antichristian apostasy; which is not of my present consideration.
				</p><p>
   But we may proceed to what is of our own immediate concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>. And the
   one work with that before described is still carried on. The person of
   Christ, the faith of the church concerning it, the relation of the
   church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, the building of the church on it, the life and
   preservation of the church thereby, are the things that the gates of
   hell are engaged in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. For,
				</p><p>
   1. It is known with what subtlety and urgency his divine nature and
   person are opposed by the Socinians. What an accession is made daily
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their incredulity, what inclination of mind multitudes do manifest
   towards their pernicious ways, are also evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all who have any
   concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in or for religion. But this argument I have laboured in on
   other occasions.
				</p><p>
   2. Many, who expressly deny not his divine person, yet seem to grow
   weary of any concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. A natural religion, or none at all,
   pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note> them better than faith in God by Jesus Christ. That any thing
   more is necessary in religion, but what natural light will discover and
   conduct us in, with the moral duties of righteousness and honesty which
   it directs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, there are too many that will not acknowledge. What is
   beyond the line of nature and reason is rejected as unintelligible
   mysteries or follies. The person and grace of Christ are supposed to
   breed all the disturbance in religion. Without them, the common notions
   of the Divine Being and goodness will guide men sufficiently to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   eternal blessedness. They did so before the coming of Christ in the
   flesh, and may do so now he is gone to heaven.
				</p><p>
   3. There are some who have so ordered the frame of objective religion,
   as that it is very uncertain whether they leave any place for the
   person of Christ in it or no. For, besides their denial of the
   hypostatical union of his natures, they ascribe all that to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a light
   within them which God will effect only by Christ as a mediator. What
   are the internal actings of their minds, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faith and trust
   towards him, I know not; but, from their outward profession, he seems
   to be almost excluded.
				</p><p>
   4. There are not a few who pretend high to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> religion and devotion, who
   declare no erroneous conceptions about the doctrine of the person of
   Christ, who yet manifest themselves not to have that regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   which the Gospel prescribes and requires. Hence have we so many
   discourses published about religion, the practical holiness and duties
   of obedience, written with great elegance of style, and seriousness in
   argument, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we can meet with little or nothing in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus
   Christ, his office, or his grace, are concerned. Yea, it is odds but in
   them all we shall meet with some reflections on those who judge them to
   be the life and centre of our religion. The things of Christ, beyond
   the example of his conversation on the earth, are of no use with such
   persons, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the promotion of piety and gospel obedience. Concerning
   many books of this nature, we may say what a learned person did of one
   of old: "There were in it many things laudable and delectable, sed
   nomen Jesu non erat ibi."
				</p><p>
   5. Suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these manifest inclinations of the minds of men to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a
   neglect of Christ, in the religion they frame to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves --
   dangerous and noxious insinuations concerning what our thoughts ought
   to be of him, are made and tendered. As, (1.) It is scandalously
   proposed and answered, "Of what use is the consideration of the person
   of Christ in our religion?" Such are the novel inquiries of men who
   suppose there is any thing in Christian religion in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the person of
   Christ is of no consideration -- as though it were not the life and
   soul that animates the whole of it, that which gives it its special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>
   form as Christian -- as though by virtue of our religion we received
   any thing from God, any benefit in mercy, grace, privilege, or glory,
   and not through the person of Christ -- as though any one duty or act
   of religion towards God could be acceptably performed by us, without a
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, or a consideration of, the person of Christ -- or that
   there were any lines of truth in religion as it is Christian, that did
   not relate to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Such bold inquiries, with futilous answers
   annexed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, sufficiently manifest what acquaintance their
   authors have either with Christ himself, which in others they despise,
   or with his Gospel, which they pretend to embrace. (2.) A mock scheme
   of religion is framed, to represent the folly of them who design to
   learn the mind and will of God in and by him. (3.) Reproachful
   reflections are made on such as plead the necessity of acquaintance
   with him, or the knowledge of him, as though thereby they rejected the
   use of the gospel. (4.) Professed love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ is
   traduced, as a mere fancy and vapour of distempered minds or weak
   imaginations. (5.) The union of the Lord Christ and his church is
   asserted to be political only, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> laws and rules of
   government. And many other things of an alike nature are asserted,
   derogatory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his glory, and repugnant to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the faith of the church;
   such as, from the foundation of Christian religion, were never vented
   by any persons before, who did not openly avow some impious heresy
   concerning his person. And I no way doubt but that men may, with less
   guilt and scandal, fall under sundry doctrinal misapprehensions
   concerning it -- than, by crying hail to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, to despoil it of all
   its glory, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, in our practical obedience
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. Such things have we deserved to see and hear.
				</p><p>
   6. The very name or expression of "preaching Christ" is become a term
   of reproach and contempt; nor can some, as they say, understand what is
   meant thereby, unless it be an engine to drive all rational preaching,
   and so all morality and honesty, out of the world.
				</p><p>
   7. That which all these things tend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and centre in, is that
   horrible profaneness of life -- that neglect of all gospel duties --
   that contempt of all spiritual graces and their effects, which the
   generality of them that are called Christians, in many places, are
   given up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. I know not whether it were not more for the honour of
   Christ, that such persons would publicly renounce the profession of his
   name, rather than practically manifest their inward disregard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   That by these and the like means Satan does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> yet attempt the ruin of the
   church, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its building on the everlasting rock, falls under the
   observation of all who are concerned in its welfare. And (whatever
   others may apprehend concerning this state of things in the world) how
   any that love the Lord Jesus in sincerity -- especially such as are
   called to declare and represent him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men in the office of the
   ministry -- can acquit themselves to be faithful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, without
   giving their testimony against, and endeavouring to stop what lies in
   them, the progress of this prevailing declension from the only
   foundation of the church, I know not; nor will it be easy for
   themselves to declare. And in that variety of conceptions which are
   about him, and the opposition that is made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, there is nothing
   more necessary than that we should renew and attest our confession of
   him -- as the Son of the living God -- the only rock whereon the church
   of them that shall be saved is founded and built.
				</p><p>
   "Pauca ideo de Christo," as Tertullian speaks; some few things
   concerning the person of Christ, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the confession of
   Peter, and the promise to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> annexed -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is declared the
   sole foundation of the church -- will be comprised in the ensuing
   discourse. And He who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordained strength out of the mouths of babes
   and sucklings, as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given ability to express these poor, mean
   contemplations of his glory, can raise by them a revenue of honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   himself in the hearts of them that do believe. And some few things I
   must premise, in general, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what I do design. As,
				</p><p>
   1. The instances which I shall give concerning the use and
   consideration of the person of Christ in Christian religion, or of him
   as he is the foundation whereon the church is built, are but few -- and
   those perhaps not the most signal or eminent which the greater
   spiritual wisdom and understanding of others might propose. And,
   indeed, who shall undertake to declare what are the chief instances of
   this incomprehensible effect of divine wisdom? "What is his name, and
   what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?" <reference osisRef="Prov.30.4">Proverbs 30:4</reference> See <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference> It is enough for us to stand in a holy admiration, at the shore of
   this unsearchable ocean, and to gather up some parcels of that divine
   treasure with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> the Scripture of truth is enriched.
				</p><p>
   2. I make no pretence of searching into the bottom or depths of any
   part of this "great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh."
   They are altogether unsearchable, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the line of the most enlightened
   minds, in this life. What we shall farther comprehend of them in the
   other world, God only knows. We cannot in these things, by our utmost
   diligent search, "find out the Almighty to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfection." The prophets
   could not do so of old, nor can the angels themselves at present, who
   "desire to look into these things:" <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.10 1Pet.1.11 1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:10-12</reference> Only I shall
   endeavour to represent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the faith of them that do believe, somewhat
   of what the Scripture does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> plainly reveal -- evidencing in what sense
   the person of Christ is the sole foundation of the church.
				</p><p>
   3. I shall not, in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, respect them immediately by whom the divine
   person of Christ is denied and opposed. I have formerly treated
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, beyond their contradiction in way of reply. But it is their
   conviction which I shall respect in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, who, under an outward
   confession of the truth, do -- either notionally or practically, either
   ignorantly or designedly, God knows, I know not -- endeavour to weaken
   the faith of the church in its adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this foundation. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>,
   neither the one sort nor the other has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any place in my thoughts, in
   comparison of the instruction and edification of others, who love the
   Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.

<title>Chapter 3 The Person of Christ the most ineffable Effect of Divine Wisdom and Goodness -- Thence the next Cause of all True Religion -- In what sense it is so.</title>
<p>   The person of Christ is the most glorious and ineffable effect of
   divine wisdom, grace, and power; and therefore is the next foundation
   of all acceptable religion and worship. The Divine Being itself is the
   first formal reason, foundation, and object of all religion. It all
   depends on taking God to be our God; which is the first of his
   commands. For religion, and the worship performed in it, is nothing but
   the due respect of rational creatures to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine nature, and its
   infinite excellencies. It is the glorifying of God as God; the way of
   expressing that respect being regulated by the revelation of his will.
   Yet the divine essence is not, in itself, the next and immediate cause
   of religious worship. But it is the manifestation of this Being and its
   excellencies, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> the mind of rational creatures is immediately
   affected, and through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it is obliged to give that religious honour and
   worship which is due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that Being, and necessary from our relation
   to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Upon this manifestation, all creatures capable by an
   intelligent nature of a sense of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, are indispensably obliged to
   give all divine honour and glory to God.
				</p><p>
   The way alone through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> this manifestation may be made, is by outward
   acts and effects. For, in itself, the divine nature is hid from all
   living, and dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in that light to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> no creature can approach.
   This, therefore, God first made, by the creation of all things out of
   nothing. The creation of man himself -- with the principles of a
   rational, intelligent nature, a conscience attesting his subordination
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God -- and the creation of all other things, declaring the glory
   of his wisdom, goodness, and power, was the immediate ground of all
   natural religion, and yet continues so to be. And the glory of it
   answers the means and ways of the manifestation of the Divine Being,
   existence, excellencies, and properties. And where this manifestation
   is despised or neglected, there God himself is so; as the apostle
   discourses<note n="discourseth">Auto-modernized</note> at large, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.18 Rom.1.19 Rom.1.20 Rom.1.21 Rom.1.22">Romans 1:18-22</reference>
				</p><p>
   But of all the effects of the divine excellencies, the constitution of
   the person of Christ as the foundation of the new creation, as "the
   mystery of Godliness," was the most ineffable and glorious. I speak not
   of his divine person absolutely; for his distinct personality and
   subsistence was by an internal and eternal act of the Divine Being in
   the person of the Father, or eternal generation -- which is essential
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine essence -- through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> nothing anew was outwardly wrought
   or did exist. He was not, he is not, in that sense, the effect of the
   divine wisdom and power of God, but the essential wisdom and power of
   God himself. But we speak of him only as incarnate, as he assumed our
   nature into personal subsistence with himself. His conception in the
   womb of the Virgin, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the integrity of human nature, was a
   miraculous operation of the divine power. But the prevention of that
   nature from any subsistence of its own -- by its assumption into
   personal union with the Son of God, in the first instance of its
   conception -- is that which is above all miracles, nor can be designed
   by that name. A mystery it is, so far above the order of all creating
   or providential operations, that it wholly transcends the sphere of
   them that are most miraculous. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> did God glorify all the
   properties of the divine nature, acting in a way of infinite wisdom,
   grace, and condescension. The depths of the mystery of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> are open
   only to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him whose understanding it infinite, which no created
   understanding can comprehend. All other things were produced and
   effected by an outward emanation of power from God. He said, "Let there
   be light, and there was light." But this assumption of our nature into
   hypostatical union with the Son of God, this constitution of one and
   the same individual person in two natures so infinitely distinct as
   those of God and man -- through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the Eternal was made in time, the
   Infinite became finite, the Immortal mortal, yet continuing eternal,
   infinite, immortal -- is that singular expression of divine wisdom,
   goodness, and power, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God will be admired and glorified to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all
   eternity. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> was that change introduced into the whole first
   creation, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the blessed angels were exalted, Satan and his works
   ruined, mankind recovered from a dismal apostasy, all things made new,
   all things in heaven and earth reconciled and gathered into one Head,
   and a revenue of eternal glory raised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, incomparably above what
   the first constitution of all things in the order of nature could yield
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   In the expression of this mystery, the Scripture does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> sometimes draw
   the veil over it, as that which we cannot look into. So, in his
   conception of the Virgin, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this union which
   accompanied it, it was told her, that "the power of the Highest should
   overshadow her:" <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference> A work it was of the power of the Most
   High, but hid from the eyes of men in the nature of it; and, therefore,
   that holy thing which had no subsistence of its own, which should be
   born of her, should "be called the Son of God," becoming one person
   with him. Sometimes it expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the greatness of the mystery, and
   leaves it as an object of our admiration, <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>: "Without
   controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the
   flesh." A mystery it is, and that of those dimensions as no creature
   can comprehend. Sometimes it puts<note n="putteth">Auto-modernized</note> things together, as that the
   distance of the two natures illustrate the glory of the one person,
   <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>: "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." But what
   Word was this? That which was in the beginning, which was with God,
   which was God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not
   any thing made that was made; who was light and life. This Word was
   made flesh, not by any change of his own nature or essence, not by a
   transubstantiation of the divine nature into the human, not by ceasing
   to be what he was, but by becoming what he was not, in taking our
   nature to his own, to be his own, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he dwelt among us. This
   glorious Word, which is God, and described by his eternity and
   omnipotence in works of creation and providence, "was made flesh," --
   which expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the lowest state and condition of human nature.
   Without controversy, great is this mystery of godliness! And in that
   state in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he visibly appeared as so made flesh, those who had eyes
   given them from above, saw "his glory, the glory as of the
   only-begotten of the Father." The eternal Word being made flesh, and
   manifested in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, they saw his glory, the glory of the only-begotten
   of the Father. What heart can conceive, what tongue can express, the
   least part of the glory of this divine wisdom and grace? So also is it
   proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>: "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a child is born, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a son
   is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name
   shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
   Father, The Prince of Peace." He is called, in the first place,
   Wonderful. And that deservedly: <reference osisRef="Prov.30.4">Proverbs 30:4</reference> That the mighty God
   should be a child born, and the everlasting Father a son given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us,
   may well entitle him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the name of Wonderful.
				</p><p>
   Some amongst us say, that if there were no other way for the redemption
   and salvation of the church, but this only of the incarnation and
   mediation of the Son of God, there was no wisdom in the contrivance of
   it. Vain man indeed would be wise, but is like the wild ass's colt. Was
   there no wisdom in the contrivance of that which, when it is effected,
   leaves nothing but admiration to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the utmost of all created wisdom?
   Who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> known the mind of the Lord in this thing, or who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been his
   counsellor in this work, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the mighty God became a child born to
   us, a son given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us? Let all vain imaginations cease: there is
   nothing left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the sons of men, but either to reject the divine
   person of Christ -- as many do to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their own destruction -- or humbly
   to adore the mystery of infinite wisdom and grace in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And it will
   require a condescending charity, to judge that those do really believe
   the incarnation of the Son of God, who live not in the admiration of
   it, as the most adorable effect of divine wisdom.
				</p><p>
   The glory of the same mystery is elsewhere testified to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.1 Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:1-3</reference>:
   "God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by his Son, by whom also he made the worlds;
   who, being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
   person, upholding all things by the word of his power, by himself
   purged our sin." That he purged our sins by his death, and the oblation
   of himself in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, is acknowledged. That this should be done
   by him by whom the worlds were made, who is the essential brightness of
   the divine glory, and the express image of the person of the Father
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> who upholds, rules, sustains all things by the word of his
   power, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God purchased his church with his own blood, <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference>, is that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he will be admired to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity. See <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8 Phil.2.9">Philippians 2:6-9</reference>
				</p><p>
   Isa. vi there is a representation made of him as on a throne, filling
   the temple with the train of his glory. The Son of God it was who was
   so represented, and that as he was to fill the temple of his human
   nature with divine glory, when the fulness of the godhead dwelt in him
   bodily. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the seraphim, which administered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, had six
   wings, with two of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> they covered their faces, as not being able to
   behold or look into the glorious mystery of his incarnation: verses 2,
   3; <reference osisRef="John.12.39 John.12.40 John.12.41">John 12:39-41</reference>; ii. 19; <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference> But when the same ministering
   spirits, under the name of cherubim, attended the throne of God, in the
   administration of his providence as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the disposal and government of
   the world, they had four wings only, and covered not their faces, but
   steadily beheld the glory of it: <reference osisRef="Ezek.1.6">Ezekiel 1:6</reference>; x. 2, 3.
				</p><p>
   This is the glory of the Christian religion -- the basis and foundation
   that bears the whole superstructure -- the root whereon it grows. This
   is its life and soul, that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it differs from, and inconceivably
   excels, whatever was in true religion before, or whatever any false
   religion pretended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Religion, in its first constitution, in the
   estate of pure, uncorrupted nature, was orderly, beautiful and
   glorious. Man being made in the image of God, was fit and able to
   glorify him as God. But whereas, whatever perfection God had
   communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our nature, he had not united it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Himself in a
   personal union, the fabric of it quickly fell to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ground. Want of
   this foundation made it obnoxious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> ruin. God manifested in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>,
   that no gracious relation between him and our nature could be stable
   and permanent, unless our nature was assumed into personal union and
   subsistence with himself. This is the only rock and assured foundation
   of the relation of the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, which, now, can never utterly
   fail. Our nature is eternally secured in that union, and we ourselves
   (as we shall see) thereby. "In him all things consist;" <reference osisRef="Col.1.17 Col.1.18">Colossians 1:17-18</reference>;
   therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, whatever beauty and glory there was in the relation that was
   between God and man, and the relation of all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by man --
   in the preservation of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> natural religion did consist -- it had no
   beauty nor glory in comparison of this which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> excel, or the
   manifestation of God in the flesh -- the appearance and subsistence of
   the divine and human natures in the same single individual person. And
   whereas God in that state had given man dominion "over the fish of the
   sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all
   the earth," <reference osisRef="Gen.1.26">Genesis 1:26</reference>, it was all but an obscure representation of the
   exaltation of our nature in Christ -- as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.6 Heb.2.7 Heb.2.8 Heb.2.9">Hebrews 2:6-9</reference>
				</p><p>
   There was true religion in the world after the fall, both before and
   after the giving of the Law; a religion built upon and resolved into
   divine revelation. And as for the outward glory of it -- the
   administration that it was brought into under the tabernacle and temple
   -- it was beyond what is represented in the institutions of the gospel.
   Yet is Christian religion, our evangelical profession, and the state of
   the church upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, far more glorious, beautiful, and perfect, than
   that state of religion was capable of, or could attain. And as this is
   evident from hence, because God in his wisdom, grace, and love to the
   church, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> removed that state, and introduced this in the room
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; so the apostle proves it -- in all considerable instances --
   in his Epistle to the Hebrews, written to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that purpose. There were
   two things, before, in religion; -- the promise, which was the life of
   it; and the institutions of worship under the Law, which were the
   outward glory and beauty of it. And both these were nothing, or had
   nothing in them, but only what they before proposed and represented of
   Christ, God manifested in the flesh. The promise was concerning him,
   and the institutions of worship did only represent him. So the apostle
   declares it, <reference osisRef="Col.2.17">Colossians 2:17</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as all the religion that was in
   the world after the fact was built on the promise of this work of God,
   in due time to be accomplished; so it is the actual performance of it
   which is the foundation of the Christian religion, and which gives it
   the pre-eminence above all that went before it. So the apostle
   expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> it, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.1 Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:1-3</reference>, "God, who at sundry times, and in divers
   manners, spake in time past to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the fathers by the prophets, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in
   these last days spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by his Son, whom he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed heir
   of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who, being the
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and
   upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself
   purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high."
				</p><p>
   All false religion pretended always to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> things that were mysterious.
   And the more men could invent, or the devil suggest, that had an
   appearance of that nature, as sundry things were so introduced horrid
   and dreadful, the more reverence and esteem were reconciled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it.
   But the whole compass of the craft of Satan and the imaginations of men
   could never extend itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the least resemblance of this mystery.
   And it is not amiss conjectured, that the apostle, in his description
   of it, <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>, did reflect upon and condemn the vanity of the
   Eleusinian mysteries, which were of the greatest vogue and reputation
   among the gentiles.
				</p><p>
   Take away the consideration of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, and we despoil the Christian
   religion of all its glory, debasing it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what Mohammedanism pretends
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what in Judaism was really enjoyed.
				</p><p>
   The faith of this mystery enables the mind in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is -- rendering
   it spiritual and heavenly, transforming it into the image of God.
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> consists the excellency of faith above all other powers and acts
   of the soul -- that it receives, assents to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and rests in, things in
   their own nature absolutely incomprehensible. It is elenchos ou
   blepomenon, <reference osisRef="Heb.11.1">Hebrews 11:1</reference>, -- "The evidence of things not seen" -- that
   which makes evident, as by demonstration, those things which are no way
   objected to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sense, and which reason cannot comprehend. The more
   sublime and glorious -- the more inaccessible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sense and reason --
   the things are which we believe; the more are we changed into the image
   of God, in the exercise of faith upon them. Hence we find this most
   glorious effect of faith, or the transformation of the mind into the
   likeness of God, no less real, evident, and eminent in many, whose
   rationally comprehensive abilities are weak and contemptible, in the
   eye of that wisdom which is of this world, than in those of the highest
   natural sagacity, enjoying the best improvements of reason. For "God
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the
   kingdom:" <reference osisRef="Jas.2.5">James 2:5</reference> However they may be poor, and, as another
   apostle speaks<note n="speaketh">Auto-modernized</note>, "foolish, weak, base, and despised;" <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.27 1Cor.1.28">1 Corinthians 1:27-28</reference>; yet that faith which enables them to assent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and embrace divine
   mysteries, renders them rich in the sight of God, in that it makes them
   like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   Some would have all things that we are to believe to be levelled
   absolutely to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our reason and comprehension -- a principle which, at
   this day, shakes the very foundations of the Christian religion. It is
   not sufficient, they say, to determine that the faith or knowledge of
   any thing is necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our obedience and salvation, that it seems
   to be fully and perspicuously revealed in the Scripture -- unless the
   things so revealed be obvious and comprehensible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our reason; an
   apprehension which, as it arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from the pride which naturally ensues
   on the ignorance of God and ourselves, so it is not only an invention
   suited to debase religion, but an engine to evert the faith of the
   church in all the principal mysteries of the Gospel -- especially of
   the Trinity and the incarnation of the Son of God. But faith which is
   truly divine, is never more in its proper exercise -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> never more
   elevate the soul into conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God -- than when it acts in the
   contemplation and admiration of the most incomprehensible mysteries
   which are proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it by divine revelation.
				</p><p>
   Hence things philosophical, and of a deep rational indagation, find
   great acceptance in the world -- as, in their proper place, they do
   deserve. Men are furnished with proper measures of them, and they find
   them proportionate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the principles of their own understandings. But
   as for spiritual and heavenly mysteries, the thoughts of men for the
   most part recoil, upon their first proposal, nor will be encouraged to
   engage in a diligent inquiry into them -- yea, commonly reject them as
   foolish, or at least that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are not concerned. The reason is
   that given in another case by the apostle: "All men have not faith," <reference osisRef="2Thess.3.2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</reference>, which makes them absurd and unreasonable in the
   consideration of the proper objects of it. But where this faith is, the
   greatness of the mysteries which it embraces<note n="embraceth">Auto-modernized</note> heightens its efficacy,
   in all its blessed effects, upon the soul. Such is this constitution of
   the person of Christ, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of all the holy properties and
   perfections of the divine nature is manifested, and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> shine forth.
   So speaks the apostle, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>: "Beholding as in a glass the
   glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image, from glory to
   glory." This glory which we behold, is the glory of the face of God in
   Jesus Christ, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>, or the glorious representation which is made
   of him in the person of Christ, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we shall treat afterwards. The
   glass in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this glory is represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   view and contemplation -- is divine revelation in the gospel. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> we
   behold it, by faith alone. And those whose view is steadfast, who most
   abound in that contemplation by the exercise of faith, are thereby
   "changed into the same image, from glory to glory" -- or are more and
   more renewed and transformed into the likeness of God, so represented
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
				</p><p>
   That which shall, at last, perfectly effect our utmost conformity to
   God, and, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, our eternal blessedness -- is vision, or sight. "We
   shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is:" <reference osisRef="1John.3.2">1 John 3:2</reference> Here
   faith begins what sight shall perfect hereafter. But yet "we walk by
   faith, and not by sight:" <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.7">2 Corinthians 5:7</reference> And although the life of faith
   and vision differ in degrees -- or, as some think, in kind -- yet have
   they both the same object, and the same operations, and there is a
   great cognation between them. The object of vision is the whole mystery
   of the divine existence and will; and its operation is a perfect
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God -- a likeness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our blessedness
   shall consist. Faith has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the same object, and the same operations in
   its degree and measure. The great and incomprehensible mysteries of the
   Divine Being -- of the will and wisdom of God -- are its proper
   objects; and its operation, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, is conformity and
   likeness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And this it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, in a peculiar manner, in the
   contemplation of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; and
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> we have our nearest approaches to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the life of vision, and the
   effects of it. For in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, "beholding the glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ, we are changed into the same image, from glory to glory;"
   which, perfectly to consummate, is the effect of sight in glory. The
   exercise of faith in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> more raise and perfect the mind -- more
   dispose it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> holy, heavenly frames and affections -- than any other
   duty whatever.
				</p><p>
   To be nigh to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and to be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, are the same. To be
   always with him, and perfectly like him, according to the capacity of
   our nature, is to be eternally blessed. To live by faith in the
   contemplation of the glory of God in Christ, is that initiation into
   both, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are capable in this world. The endeavours of some to
   contemplate and report the glory of God in nature -- in the works of
   creation and providence -- in the things of the greater and the lesser
   world -- do deserve their just commendation; and it is that which the
   Scripture in sundry places calls us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. But for any there to abide,
   there to bound their designs -- when they have a much more noble and
   glorious object for their meditations, viz., the glory of God in Christ
   -- is both to despise the wisdom of God in that revelation of himself,
   and to come short of that transforming efficacy of faith in the
   contemplation of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. For to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>
   alone does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it belong, and not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any natural knowledge, nor to any
   knowledge of the most secret recesses of nature.
				</p><p>
   I shall only say, that those who are inconversant with these objects of
   faith -- whose minds are not delighted in the admiration of, and
   acquiescence in, things incomprehensible, such as is this constitution
   of the person of Christ -- who would reduce all things to the measure
   of their own understandings, or else wilfully live in the neglect of
   what they cannot comprehend -- do not much prepare themselves for that
   vision of these things in glory, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our blessedness does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist.
				</p><p>
   Moreover, this constitution of the person of Christ being the most
   admirable and ineffable effect of divine wisdom, grace, and power, it
   is that alone which can bear the weight of the whole superstructure of
   the mystery of godliness -- that into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole sanctification and
   salvation of the church is resolved -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> alone faith can find
   rest and peace. "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,
   which is Jesus Christ:" <reference osisRef="1Cor.3.11">1 Corinthians 3:11</reference> Rest and peace with God is that
   which we seek after. "What shall we do to be saved?" In this inquiry,
   the acts of the mediatory office of Christ are, in the Gospel, first
   presented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- especially his oblation and intercession. Through
   them is he able to save to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the uttermost those that come to God by
   him. But there were oblations for sin, and intercessions for sinners,
   under the Old Testament; yet of them all does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle affirm, that
   they could not make them perfect that came to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by them, not take
   away conscience condemning for sin: <reference osisRef="Heb.10.1 Heb.10.2 Heb.10.3 Heb.10.4">Hebrews 10:1-4</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it is not
   these things in themselves that can give us rest and peace, but their
   relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ. The oblation and intercession of
   any other would not have saved us. Hence, for the security of our
   faith, we are minded that "God redeemed the church with his own blood:"
   <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference> He did so who was God, as he was manifested in the flesh.
   His blood alone could purge our consciences from dead works, who did
   offer himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, through the eternal Spirit: <reference osisRef="Heb.9.14">Hebrews 9:14</reference> And
   when the apostle -- for our relief against the guilt of sin -- calls<note n="calleth">Auto-modernized</note>
   us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of intercession and propitiation, he minds<note n="mindeth">Auto-modernized</note>
   us peculiarly of his person by whom they are performed, <reference osisRef="1John.2.1 1John.2.2">1 John 2:1-2</reference>: "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
   the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins." And we may
   briefly consider the order of these things.
				</p><p>
   1. We suppose, in this case, conscience to be awakened to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a sense of
   sin, and of apostasy from God thereby. These things are now generally
   looked on as of no great concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- by some made a mock of
   -- and, by the most, thought easy to be dealt withal -- at time
   convenient. But when God fixes<note n="fixeth">Auto-modernized</note> an apprehension of his displeasure for
   them on the soul -- if it be not before it be too late -- it will cause
   men to look out for relief.
				</p><p>
   2. This relief is proposed in the gospel. And it is the death and
   mediation of Christ alone. By them peace with God must be obtained, or
   it will cease for ever. But,
				</p><p>
   3. When any person comes practically to know how great a thing it is
   for an apostate sinner to obtain the remission of sins, and an
   inheritance among them that are sanctified, endless objections through
   the power of unbelief will arise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his disquiet<note n="disquietment">Auto-modernized</note>. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>,
				</p><p>
   4. That which is principally suited to give him rest, peace, and
   satisfaction -- and without which nothing else can so do -- is the due
   consideration of, and the acting of faith upon, this infinite effect of
   divine wisdom and goodness, in the constitution of the person of
   Christ. This at first view will reduce the mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that conclusion,
   "If thou canst believe, all things are possible." For what end cannot
   be effected hereby? What end cannot be accomplished that was designed
   in it? Is any thing too hard for God? Did God ever do any thing like
   this, or make use of any such means for any other end whatever? Against
   this no objection can arise. On this consideration of him, faith
   apprehends Christ to be -- as he is indeed -- the power of God, and the
   wisdom of God, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the salvation of them that do believe; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it find rest with peace.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 4 The Person of Christ the Foundation of all the Counsels of God">
<title>Chapter 4 The Person of Christ the Foundation of all the Counsels of God.</title>
<p>   Secondly, The person of Christ is the foundation of all the counsels of
   God, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own eternal glory in the vocation, sanctification, and
   salvation of the church. That which I intend is what the apostle
   expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.9 Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:9-10</reference>: "Having made known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us the mystery of
   his will, according to his good pleasure, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> purposed in
   himself: that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might
   gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven,
   and which are on earth; even in him." The "mysteries of the will of
   God, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself" --
   are his counsels concerning his own eternal glory, in the
   sanctification and salvation of the church here below, to be united
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that above. The absolute original of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> was in his own good
   pleasure, or the sovereign acting of his wisdom and will. But it was
   all to be effected in Christ -- which the apostle twice repeats: he
   would gather "all things into a head in Christ, even in him" -- that
   is, in him alone.
				</p><p>
   Thus it is said of him, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his future incarnation and
   work of mediation, that the Lord possessed him in the beginning of his
   way, before his works of old; that he was set up from everlasting, from
   the beginning, or ever the earth was: <reference osisRef="Prov.8.22 Prov.8.23">Proverbs 8:22-23</reference> The eternal
   personal existence of the Son of God is supposed in these expressions,
   as I have elsewhere proved. Without it, none of these things could be
   affirmed of him. But there is a regard in them, both to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his future
   incarnation, and the accomplishment of the counsels of God thereby.
   With respect to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, God "possessed him in the beginning of his way,
   and set him up from everlasting." God possessed him eternally as his
   essential wisdom -- as he was always, and is always, in the bosom of
   the Father, in the mutual ineffable love of the Father and Son, in the
   eternal bond of the Spirit. But he signally possessed him "in the
   beginning of his way" -- as his wisdom, acting in the production of all
   the ways and works that are outwardly of him. The "beginning of God's
   ways," before his works, are his counsels concerning them -- even as
   our counsels are the beginning of our ways, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> future
   works. And he "set him up from everlasting," as the foundation of all
   the counsels of his will, in and by whom they were to be executed and
   accomplished.
				</p><p>
   So it is expressed: verses 30, 31, "I was by him, as one brought up
   with him; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
   rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with
   the sons of men." And it is added, that thus it was before the
   foundation of the world was laid, or the chiefest part of the dust of
   the earth was made -- that is, [before] man was created. Not only was
   the delight of the Father in him, but his delight was in the habitable
   part of the earth, and among the sons of men -- before the creation of
   the world. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the eternal prospect of the work he had to do for
   the children of men is intended in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>. In and with him, God laid the
   foundation of all his counsels concerning his love towards the children
   of men. And two things may be observed in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   1. That the person of the Son "was set up," or exalted in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>. "I was
   set up," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "from everlasting." This cannot be spoken absolutely
   of the person of the Son himself -- the Divine nature being not capable
   of being so set up. But there was a peculiar glory and honour belonging
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of the Son, as designed by the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   execution of all the counsels of his will. Hence was that prayer of his
   upon the accomplishment of them: (<reference osisRef="John.17.5">John 17:5</reference>:) "And now, O Father,
   glorify me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee
   before the world was." To suppose that the Lord Christ prays<note n="prayeth">Auto-modernized</note>, in
   these words, for such a real communication of the properties of the
   divine nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human as should render it immense, omniscient,
   and unconfined to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any space -- is to think that he prayed for the
   destruction, and not the exaltation of it. For, on that supposition, it
   must necessarily lose all its own essential properties, and
   consequently its being. Nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he seem to pray only for the
   manifestation of his divine nature, which was eclipsed in his
   exinanition or appearance in the form of a servant. There was no need
   to express this by -- the "glory which he had with the Father before
   the world was." For he had it not, in any special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner, before the
   world was; but equally from eternity, and in every moment of time.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, he had a peculiar glory of his own, with the Father, before
   the world was. And this was no other but that special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> exaltation which
   he had when he was "set up from everlasting," as the foundation of the
   counsels of God, for the salvation of the church. In those eternal
   transactions that were between the Father and the Son, with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his incarnation and mediation -- or his undertaking to execute and
   fulfill the eternal counsels of the wisdom and grace of the Father --
   there was a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> glory which the Son had with him -- the "glory
   which he had with the Father before the world was." For the
   manifestation of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> he now prays and that the glory of his goodness,
   grace, and love -- in his peculiar undertaking of the execution of the
   counsels of God -- might be made to appear. And this is the principal
   design of the gospel. It is the declaration, as of the grace of God the
   Father, so of the love, grace, goodness, and compassion of the Son, in
   undertaking from everlasting the accomplishment of God's counsels, in
   the salvation of the church. And hereby does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he hold up the pillars of
   the earth, or support this inferior creation, which otherwise, with the
   inhabitants of it, would by sin have been dissolved. And those by whom
   the eternal, divine pre-existence, in the form of God -- antecedent
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his incarnation -- is denied, do what lies in them expressly to
   despoil him of all that glory which he had with the Father before the
   world was. So we have in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the whole of our design. "In the beginning
   of God's ways, before his works of old" that is, in his eternal
   counsels with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the children of men, or the sanctification
   and salvation of the church -- the Lord possessed, enjoyed the Son, as
   his eternal wisdom -- in and with whom they were laid, in and by whom
   they were to be accomplished, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> his delights were with the sons
   of men.
				</p><p>
   2. That there was an ineffable delight between the Father and the Son
   in this his setting up or exaltation. "I was," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "daily his
   delight, rejoicing always before him." It is not absolutely the mutual,
   eternal delight of the Father and the Son -- arising from the
   perfection of the same divine excellencies in each person -- that is
   intended. But respect is plainly had to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the counsels of God
   concerning the salvation of mankind by him who is his power and wisdom
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end. This counsel of peace was originally between Jehovah and
   the Branch, (<reference osisRef="Zech.6.13">Zechariah 6:13</reference>,) or the Father and the Son -- as he was to
   be incarnate. For in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> was he "fore-ordained before the foundation
   of the world;" (<reference osisRef="1Pet.1.20">1 Peter 1:20</reference>,) viz., to be a Saviour and a deliverer,
   by whom all the counsels of God were to be accomplished; and this by
   his own will, and concurrence in counsel with the Father. And such a
   foundation was laid of the salvation of the church in these counsels of
   God -- as transacted between the Father and the Son -- that it is said,
   that "eternal life was promised before the world began:" <reference osisRef="Titus.1.2">Titus 1:2</reference>
   For, although the first formal promise was given after the fall, yet
   was there such a preparation of grace and eternal life in these
   counsels of God, with his unchangeable purpose to communicate them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, that all the faithfulness of God was engaged in them. "God, that
   cannot lie, promised before the world began." There was eternal life
   with the Father -- that is, in his counsel treasured up in Christ, and
   in him afterwards manifested to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us: <reference osisRef="1John.1.2">1 John 1:2</reference> And, to show the
   stability of this purpose and counsel of God, with the infallible
   consequence of his actual promise, and efficacious accomplishment
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, "grace" is said to be "given us in Christ Jesus before the
   world began:" <reference osisRef="2Tim.1.9">2 Timothy 1:9</reference>
				</p><p>
   In these counsels did God delight -- or in the person of Christ, as his
   eternal wisdom in their contrivance, and as the means of their
   accomplishment in his future incarnation. Hence he so testifies<note n="testifieth">Auto-modernized</note> of
   him: "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
   delights<note n="delighteth">Auto-modernized</note>;" (<reference osisRef="Isa.42.1">Isaiah 42:1</reference>;) as he also proclaims the same delight in
   him, from heaven, in the days of his flesh: <reference osisRef="Matt.3.17">Matthew 3:17</reference>; xvii. 5. He
   was the delight of God, as he in whom all his counsel for his own
   glory, in the redemption and salvation of the church were laid and
   founded: "My servant, in whom I will be glorified;" (<reference osisRef="Isa.49.3">Isaiah 49:3</reference>;)
   that is, "by raising the tribes of Jacob, restoring the preserved of
   Israel, in being a light to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Gentiles, and the salvation of God
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ends of the earth:" verse 6.
				</p><p>
   We conceive not aright of the counsels of God, when we think of nothing
   but the effect of them, and the glory that arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from their
   accomplishment. It is certainly true that they shall all issue in his
   glory, and the demonstration of it shall fill up eternity. The
   manifestative glory of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity, consists in the effects and
   accomplishment of his holy counsels. Heaven is the state of the actual
   accomplishment of all the counsels of God, in the sanctification and
   salvation of the church. But it is not with God as it is with men. Let
   men's counsels be ever so wise, it must needs abate of their
   satisfaction in them, because their conjectures (and more they have
   not) of their effects and events are altogether uncertain. But all the
   counsels of God having their entire accomplishment through revolutions
   perplexing and surpassing all created understandings, enclosed in them
   infallibly and immutably, the great satisfaction, complacency, and
   delight of the Divine Being is in these counsels themselves.
				</p><p>
   God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> delight in the actual accomplishment of his works. He made not
   this world, nor any thing in it, for its own sake. Much less did he
   make this earth to be a theatre for men to act their lusts upon -- the
   use which it is now put to, and groans under. But he made "all things
   for himself," <reference osisRef="Prov.16.4">Proverbs 16:4</reference>; he "made them for his pleasure," <reference osisRef="Rev.4.11">Revelation of John 4:11</reference>; that is, not only by an act of sovereignty, but to his own delight
   and satisfaction. And a double testimony did he give to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, with
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the works of creation. (1.) In the approbation which he
   gave of the whole upon its survey: and "God saw all that he had made,
   and, behold, it was very good:" <reference osisRef="Gen.1.31">Genesis 1:31</reference> There was that impression
   of his divine wisdom, power, and goodness upon the whole, as manifested
   his glory; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was well pleased. For immediately upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, all
   creatures capable of the conception and apprehension of his glory,
   "sang forth his praise:" <reference osisRef="Job.38.6 Job.38.7">Job 38:6-7</reference> (2.) In that he rested from
   his works or in them, when they were finished: <reference osisRef="Gen.2.2">Genesis 2:2</reference> It was not a
   rest of weariness from the labour of his work -- but a rest of
   complacency and delight in what he had wrought -- that God entered
   into.
				</p><p>
   But the principal delight and complacency of God, is in his eternal
   counsels. For all his delight in his works is but in the effects of
   those divine properties whose primitive and principal exercise is in
   the counsels themselves, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they proceed. Especially is it so
   as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these counsels of the Father and the Son, as to the redemption
   and salvation of the church, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they delight, and mutually rejoice
   in each other on their account. They are all eternal acts of God's
   infinite wisdom, goodness, and love -- a delight and complacency
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> is no small part of the divine blessedness. These things are
   absolutely inconceivable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and ineffable by us; we cannot find
   the Almighty out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfection. However, certain it is, from the
   notions we have of the Divine Being and excellencies, and from the
   revelation he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of himself, that there is an infinite delight
   in God -- in the eternal acting of his wisdom, goodness, and love --
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, according to our weak and dark apprehensions of things, we may
   safely place no small portion of divine blessedness. Self-existence in
   its own immense being -- thence self-sufficiency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> itself in all
   things -- and upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> self-satisfaction -- is the principal notion we
   have of divine blessedness.
				</p><p>
   1. God delights<note n="delighteth">Auto-modernized</note> in these his eternal counsels in Christ, as they are
   acts of infinite wisdom, as they are the highest instance in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it
   will exert itself. Hence, in the accomplishment of them, Christ is
   emphatically said to be the "Wisdom of God," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.24">1 Corinthians 1:24</reference>, he in whom
   the counsels of his wisdom were to be fulfilled. And in him is the
   manifold wisdom of God made known: <reference osisRef="Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:10</reference> Infinite wisdom being
   that property of the divine nature through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> all the actings of it are
   disposed and regulated, suitably to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own glory, in all his divine
   excellencies -- he cannot but delight in all the acts of it. Even
   amongst men -- whose wisdom compared with that of God is folly itself
   -- yet is there nothing in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they have a real rational complacency,
   suitable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the principles of their nature, but in such actings of
   that wisdom which they have (and such as it is) towards the proper ends
   of their being and duty. How much more does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> God delight himself in the
   infinite perfection of his own wisdom, and its eternal acting for the
   representation of all the glorious excellencies of his nature! Such are
   his counsels concerning the salvation of the church by Jesus Christ;
   and because they were all laid in him and with him, therefore is he
   said to be his "delight continually before the world was." This is that
   which is proposed as the object of our admiration, <reference osisRef="Rom.11.33 Rom.11.34 Rom.11.35 Rom.11.36">Romans 11:33-36</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. They are acts of infinite goodness, whereon the divine nature cannot
   but be infinitely delighted in them. As wisdom is the directive
   principle of all divine operations, so goodness is the communicative
   principle that is effectual in them. He is good, and he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> good --
   yea, he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> good because he is good, and for no other reason -- not by
   the necessity of nature, but by the intervention of a free act of his
   will. His goodness is absolutely infinite, essentially perfect in
   itself; which it could not be if it belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, naturally and
   necessarily, to act and communicate itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any thing without God
   himself. The divine nature is eternally satisfied in and with its own
   goodness; but it is that principle which is the immediate fountain of
   all the communications of good to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others, by a free act of the will
   of God. So when Moses desired to see his glory, he tells him that "he
   will cause all his goodness to pass before him, and would be gracious
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom he would be gracious:" <reference osisRef="Exod.33.19">Exodus 33:19</reference> All divine
   operations -- in the gracious communication of God himself -- are from
   his goodness, by the intervention of a free act of his will. And the
   greatest exercise and emanation of divine goodness, was in these holy
   counsels of God for the salvation of the church by Jesus Christ. For
   whereas in all other effects of his goodness he gives of his own,
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he gave himself, in taking our nature upon him. And thence, as
   he expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> the design of man in his fall, as upbraiding him with
   folly and ingratitude, "Behold, the man is become as one of us," <reference osisRef="Gen.3.22">Genesis 3:22</reference>, we may, with all humble thankfulness, express the means of our
   recovery, "Behold, God is become like one of us," as the apostle
   declares it at large, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:6-8</reference> It is the nature of sincere
   goodness -- even in its lowest degree -- above all other habits or
   principles of nature, to give a delight and complacency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the mind
   in the exercise of itself, and communication of its effects. A good man
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> both delight in doing good, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> an abundant reward for the
   doing it, in the doing of it. And what shall we conceive concerning
   eternal, absolute, infinite, perfect, immixed goodness, acting itself
   in the highest instance (in an effect cognate and like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it) that it
   can extend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>! So was it in the counsels of God, concerning the
   incarnation of his Son and the salvation of the church thereby. No
   heart can conceive, no tongue can express, the least portion of that
   ineffable delight of the holy, blessed God, in these counsels, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   he acted and expressed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the utmost his own essential goodness.
   Shall a liberal man devise liberal things, because they are suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his inclination? Shall a good man find a secret refreshment and
   satisfaction in the exercise of that low, weak, imperfect, minced
   goodness, that his nature is inlaid withal? -- And shall not He whose
   goodness is essential to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- whose being it is, and in whom it is
   the immediate principle of communicating himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others -- be
   infinitely delighted in the highest exercise of it which divine wisdom
   did direct?
				</p><p>
   The effect of these eternal counsels of God in future glory is reserved
   for them that do believe; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> will there be the nearest
   manifestation of the glory of God himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, when he "shall be
   glorified in his saints," and eternally "admired in all that believe."
   But the blessed delight and satisfaction of God, was, and is, in those
   counsels themselves, as they were acts of his infinite wisdom and
   goodness. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> was the Lord Christ his "delight continually before
   the foundation of the world," -- in that in him were all these counsels
   laid, and through him were they all to be accomplished. The
   constitution of his person was the only way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom and
   goodness would act and communicate of themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mankind -- in
   which actings are the eternal delight and complacency of the Divine
   Being.
				</p><p>
   3. Love and grace have the same influence into the counsels of God, as
   wisdom and goodness have. And, in the Scripture notion of these things,
   they superadd to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> goodness this consideration -- that their object is
   sinners, and those that are unworthy. God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> universally communicate
   of his goodness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all his creatures, though there be a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>
   exercise of it towards them that believe. But as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his love and
   grace, as they are peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his elect -- the church chosen in
   Christ before the foundation of the world -- so they respect them
   primarily in a lost, undone condition by sin. "God commends<note n="commendeth">Auto-modernized</note> his love
   towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us:"
   <reference osisRef="Rom.5.8">Romans 5:8</reference> "God is love," says the apostle. His nature is essentially
   so. And the best conception of the natural internal acting of the holy
   persons, is love; and all the acts of it are full of delight. This is,
   as it were, the womb of all the eternal counsels of God, which renders
   his complacency in them ineffable. Hence does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he so wonderfully express
   his delight and complacency in the acting of his love towards the
   church: "The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save,
   he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will
   joy over thee with singing:" <reference osisRef="Zeph.3.17">Zephaniah 3:17</reference> The reason why, in the
   salvation of the church, he rejoices<note n="rejoiceth">Auto-modernized</note> with joy and joys<note n="joyeth">Auto-modernized</note> with singing
   -- the highest expression of divine complacency -- is because he
   rests<note n="resteth">Auto-modernized</note> in his love, and so is pleased in the exercise of its effects.
				</p><p>
   But we must return to manifest in particular how all these counsels of
   God were laid in the person of Christ -- to which end the things
   ensuing may be distinctly considered.
				</p><p>
   1. God made all things, in the beginning, good, exceeding good. The
   whole of his work was disposed into a perfect harmony, beauty, and
   order, suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that manifestation of his own glory which he
   designed in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And as all things had their own individual existence,
   and operations suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their being, and capable of an end, a rest,
   or a blessedness, congruous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their natures and operations -- so, in
   the various respects which they had each to other, in their mutual
   supplies, assistances, and co-operation, they all tended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that
   ultimate end -- his eternal glory. For as, in their beings and
   existence, they were effects of infinite power -- so were their mutual
   respects and ends disposed in infinite wisdom. Upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> were the eternal
   power and wisdom of God glorified in them; the one in their production,
   the other in their disposal into their order and harmony. Man was a
   creature that God made, that by him he might receive the glory that he
   aimed at in and by the whole inanimate creation -- both that below,
   which was for his use, and that above, which was for his contemplation.
   This was the end of our nature in its original constitution. To which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>
   are we again restored in Christ: <reference osisRef="Jas.1.18">James 1:18</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.104.24">Psalms 104:24</reference>; cxxxvi. 5;
   <reference osisRef="Rom.1.20">Romans 1:20</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. God was pleased to permit the entrance of sin, both in heaven above
   and in earth beneath, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> this whole order and harmony was
   disturbed. There are yet characters of divine power, wisdom, and
   goodness, remaining on the works of creation, and inseparable from
   their beings. But the primitive glory that was to redound to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by
   them -- especially as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all things here below -- was from the
   obedience of man, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom they were put in subjection. Their good
   estate depended on their subordination to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in a way of natural
   use, as his did on God in the way of moral obedience: <reference osisRef="Gen.1.26 Gen.1.28">Genesis 1:26, 28</reference>;
   <reference osisRef="Ps.8.6 Ps.8.7 Ps.8.8">Psalms 8:6-8</reference> Man, as was said, is a creature which God made, that by
   him he might receive the glory that he aimed at in and by the whole
   inanimate creation. This was the end of our nature in its original
   constitution. To which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> are we again restored in Christ: <reference osisRef="Jas.1.18">James 1:18</reference>
   But the entrance of sin cast all this order into confusion, and brought
   the curse on all things here below. Hereby were they deprived of that
   estate in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they were declared exceeding good, and cast into that of
   vanity -- under the burden of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> they groan, and will do so to the
   end: <reference osisRef="Gen.3.17 Gen.3.18">Genesis 3:17-18</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.8.20 Rom.8.21">Romans 8:20-21</reference> And these things we must
   again consider afterwards.
				</p><p>
   3. Divine wisdom was no way surprised with this disaster. God had, from
   all eternity, laid in provisions of counsels for the recovery of all
   things into a better and more permanent estate than what was lost by
   sin. This is the anapsuxis, the apokatastasis panton, the
   revivification, the restitution of all things, <reference osisRef="Acts.3.19 Acts.3.21">Acts 3:19, 21</reference>; the
   anakephalaiosis, or the gathering all things in heaven and earth into a
   new head in Christ Jesus: <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference> For although, it may be, there is
   more of curiosity than of edification in a scrupulous inquiry into the
   method or order of God's eternal decrees or counsels, and the disposal
   of them into a subserviency one to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another; yet this is necessary
   from the infinite wisdom, prescience, and immutability of God -- that
   he is surprised with nothing, that he is put to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> no new counsels, by
   any events in the works of creation. All things were disposed by him
   into those ways and methods -- and that from eternity -- which conduce
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and certainly issue in, that glory which is ultimately intended.
   For as we are careful to state the eternal decrees of God, and the
   actual operations of his providence, so as that the liberty of the will
   of man, as the next cause of all his moral actions, be not infringed
   thereby -- so ought we to be careful not to ascribe such a sacrilegious
   liberty to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the wills of any creatures, as that God should be
   surprised, imposed on, or changed by any of their acting whatever. For
   "known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him are all his works from the foundation of the world,"
   and with him there is neither "variableness nor shadow of turning."
				</p><p>
   4. There were, therefore, eternal counsels of God, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he disposed
   all things into a new order, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own glory, in the sanctification
   and salvation of the church. And of them two things may be considered:
   (1.) Their original; (2.) The design of their accomplishment.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Their first spring or original was in the divine will and wisdom
   alone, without respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any external moving cause. No reason can be
   given, no cause be assigned, of these counsels, but the will of God
   alone. Hence are they called or described, by -- the "good pleasure
   which he purposed in himself," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.9">Ephesians 1:9</reference>, "the purpose of him who
   works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> all things according to the counsel of his own will:"verse 11.
   "Who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> known the mind of the Lord? Or who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been his counsellor?
   Or who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> first given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and it shall be recompensed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   again? For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things:" <reference osisRef="Rom.11.34 Rom.11.35 Rom.11.36">Romans 11:34-36</reference> The incarnation of Christ, and his mediation upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, were
   not the procuring cause of these eternal counsels of God, but the
   effects of them, as the Scripture constantly declares. But, (2.) The
   design of their accomplishment was laid in the person of the Son alone.
   As he was the essential wisdom of God, all things were at first created
   by him. But upon a prospect of the ruin of all by sin, God would in and
   by him -- as he was fore-ordained to be incarnate -- restore all
   things. The whole counsel of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end centred in him alone.
   Hence their foundation is rightly said to be laid in him, and is
   declared so to be by the apostle: <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</reference> For the spring of the
   sanctification and salvation of the church lies in election, the decree
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> comprises<note n="compriseth">Auto-modernized</note> the counsels of God concerning them. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, God
   from the beginning "chooses<note n="chooseth">Auto-modernized</note> us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> salvation through sanctification
   of the Spirit;" (<reference osisRef="2Thess.2.13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</reference>;) the one being the end he designs<note n="designeth">Auto-modernized</note>,
   the other the means and way of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. But this he did in Christ; "he
   chooses<note n="chooseth">Auto-modernized</note> us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should
   be holy and without blame before him in love;" that is, "to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> salvation
   through sanctification of the Spirit." In him we were not actually, nor
   by faith, before the foundation of the world; yet were we then chosen
   in him, as the only foundation of the execution of all the counsels of
   God concerning our sanctification and salvation.
				</p><p>
   Thus as all things were originally made and created by him, as he was
   the essential wisdom of God -- so all things are renewed and recovered
   by him, as he is the provisional wisdom of God, in and by his
   incarnation. Therefore are these things put together and compared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his glory. He "is the image of the invisible God, the first born of
   every creature: for by him were all things created that are in heaven,
   and that are in earth, visible and invisible; ... all things were
   created by him and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all
   things consist: and he is the head of the body, the church; who is the
   beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might
   have the pre-eminence:" <reference osisRef="Col.1.15 Col.1.16 Col.1.17 Col.1.18">Colossians 1:15-18</reference>
				</p><p>
   Two things, as the foundation of what is ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ
   in the ensuing discourse, are asserted: verse 15. -- (1.) That he is
   "the image of the invisible God." (2.) That he is "the firstborn of
   every creature;" things seeming very distant in themselves, but
   gloriously united and centring in his person.
				</p><p>
   (1.) He is "the image of the invisible God;" or, as it is elsewhere
   expressed, he is "in the form of God" -- his essential form, for other
   form there is none in the divine nature -- the "brightness of the
   glory, and the express image of the Father's person." And he is called
   here the "invisible God," not absolutely with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his essence,
   though it be most true -- the divine essence being absolutely
   invisible, and that equally, whether considered as in the Father or in
   the Son -- but he is called so with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his counsels, his
   will, his love, and his grace. For so none has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen him at any time;
   but the only-begotten, which is in the bosom of the Father, he declares
   him: <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference> As he is thus the essential, the eternal image of the
   invisible God, his wisdom and power -- the efficiency of the first
   creation, and its consistence being created, is ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him: "By
   him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth,
   visible and invisible:" <reference osisRef="Col.1.17">Colossians 1:17</reference> And because of the great notions
   and apprehensions that were then in the world -- especially among the
   Jews, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom the apostle had respect in this epistle -- of the
   greatness and glory of the invisible part of the creation in heaven
   above, he mentions them in particular, under the most glorious titles
   that any could, or then did, ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them -- "Whether they be
   thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were
   created by him, and for him;" -- the same expression that is used of
   God absolutely: <reference osisRef="Rom.11.36">Romans 11:36</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rev.4.11">Revelation of John 4:11</reference> Add to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> those other
   places to this purpose, <reference osisRef="John.1.1 John.1.2 John.1.3">John 1:1-3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.1 Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:1-3</reference>; and those that are
   not under the efficacy of spiritual infatuations, cannot but admire at
   the power of unbelief, the blindness of the minds of men, and the craft
   of Satan, in them who deny the divine nature of Jesus Christ. For
   whereas the apostle plainly affirms, that the works of the creation do
   demonstrate the eternal power and Godhead of him by whom they were
   created; <reference osisRef="Rom.1.19 Rom.1.20">Romans 1:19-20</reference>, and not only so, but it is uncontrollably
   evident in the light of nature: it being so directly, expressly,
   frequently affirmed, that all things whatever, absolutely, and in their
   distributions into heaven and earth, with the things contained
   respectively in them, were made and created by Christ -- is the highest
   rebellion against the light and teachings of God, to disbelieve his
   divine existence and power.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Again it is added, that he is "the firstborn of every creature;"
   which principally respects the new creation, as it is declared: (verse
   18) "He is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the
   first born from the dead; that in all things he might have the
   pre-eminence." For in him were all the counsels of God laid for the
   recovery of all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself -- as he was to be incarnate. And
   the accomplishment of these counsels of God by him the apostle declares
   at large in the ensuing verses. And these things are both conjoined and
   composed in this place. As God the Father did nothing in the first
   Creation but by him -- as his eternal wisdom; (<reference osisRef="John.1.3">John 1:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.1.2">Hebrews 1:2</reference>;
   Prov. viii.;) so he designed nothing in the new creation, or
   restoration of all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his glory, but in him -- as he was to be
   incarnate. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> in his person were laid all the foundation of the
   counsels of God for the sanctification and salvation of the church.
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he is glorified, and that in a way unspeakably exceeding all
   that glory which would have accrued to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him from the first creation,
   had all things abode in their primitive constitution.
				</p><p>
   His person, therefore, is the foundation of the church -- the great
   mystery of godliness, or the religion we profess -- the entire life and
   soul of all spiritual truth -- in that all the counsels of the wisdom,
   grace, and goodness of God, for the redemption, vocation,
   sanctification, and salvation of the church, were all laid in him, and
   by him were all to be accomplished.

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 5 The Person of Christ the great Representative of God and his Will">
<title>Chapter 5 The Person of Christ the great Representative of God and his Will.</title>
<p>   What may be known of God, is, -- his nature and existence, with the
   holy counsels of his will. A representation of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us is the
   foundation of all religion, and the means of our conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him --
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our present duty and future blessedness do consist. For to know
   God, so as thereby to be made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, is the chief end of man.
   This is done perfectly only in the person of Christ, all other means of
   it being subordinate to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, and none of them of the same nature
   with that<note n="therewithal">Auto-modernized</note>. The end of the Word itself, is to instruct us in the
   knowledge of God in Christ. That, therefore, which I shall now
   demonstrate, is, that in the person and mediation of Christ (which are
   inseparable, in all the respects of faith to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him) there is made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us a blessed representation of the glorious properties of the divine
   nature, and of the holy counsels of the will of God. The first of these
   I shall speak to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in this chapter -- the other, in that which ensues;
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we shall manifest how all divine truths do centre in the person
   of Christ and the consideration of sundry things is necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   explication of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   1. God, in his own essence, being, and existence, is absolutely
   incomprehensible. His nature being immense, and all his holy properties
   essentially infinite, no creature can directly or perfectly comprehend
   them, or any of them. He must be infinite that can perfectly comprehend
   that which is infinite; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> God is perfectly known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself
   only -- but as for us, how little a portion is heard of him! Hence he
   is called "The invisible God," and said to dwell in "light
   inaccessible." The subsistence of his most single and simple nature in
   three distinct persons, though it raises and ennobles faith in its
   revelation, yet it amazes<note n="amazeth">Auto-modernized</note> reason which would trust to itself in the
   contemplation of it -- from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> men grow giddy who will own no other
   guide, and are carried out of the way of truth. "No man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen God
   at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father,
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> declared him:" <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Tim.6.16">1 Timothy 6:16</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. Therefore, we can have no direct intuitive notions or apprehensions
   of the divine essence, or its properties. Such knowledge is too
   wonderful for us. Whatever is pleaded for an intellectual vision of the
   essence of God in the light of glory, yet none pretend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a
   possibility of an immediate, full comprehension of it. But, in our
   present state, God is to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as he was to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Moses under all the
   external manifestations of his glory, "in thick darkness:" <reference osisRef="Exod.20.21">Exodus 20:21</reference> All the rational conceptions of the minds of men are swallowed up
   and lost, when they would exercise themselves directly on that which is
   absolutely immense, eternal, infinite. When we say it is so, we know
   not what we say, but only that it is not otherwise. What we deny of
   God, we know in some measure -- but what we affirm we know not; only we
   declare what we believe and adore. "Neque sensus est ejus, neque
   phantsia, neque opinio, nec ratio, nec scientia," says Dionys.De Divin.
   Nomine, 1. We have no means -- no corporeal, no intellectual instrument
   or power -- for the comprehension of him; nor has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> any other creature:
   Epei auto hoper estin ho Theos, ou monon prophetai, all? oude angeloi
   eidon, oute archanngeloi; all? ean eroteses autous, akouse peri men tes
   ousias ouden apokrinomenous; doxa de en hupsistois monon adontas to
   Theo; kan para ton Cheroubim e ton Seraphim epithumeses ti mathein, to
   mustikon tou hagiasmou melos akouse, kai hoti pleres ho ouranos kai he
   ge tes doxes autou. -- "For that which is God" (the essence of God)
   "not only have not the prophets seen, but neither the angels nor the
   archangels. If thou wilt inquire of them, thou shalt hear nothing of
   the substance of God, but only hear them say, glory to God in the
   highest.' If thou askest the cherubim and seraphim, thou shalt only
   hear the praise of holiness, The whole earth is full of his glory,' "
   says Chrysostom, on <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference> That God is in himself absolutely
   incomprehensible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, is a necessary effect of our infinite
   distance from him. But as he externally represents himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and
   by the notions which are in generated in us by the effects of his
   properties, are our conceptions of him: <reference osisRef="Ps.19.1">Psalms 19:1</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.1.20">Romans 1:20</reference> This is
   declared in the answer given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that request of Moses: "I beseech
   thee, show me thy glory:" <reference osisRef="Exod.33.18">Exodus 33:18</reference> Moses had heard a voice
   speaking to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, but he that spoke was "in thick darkness" -- he saw
   him not. Glorious evidences he gave of his majestatical presence, but
   no appearance was made of his essence or person. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> Moses desires<note n="desireth">Auto-modernized</note>,
   for the full satisfaction of his soul, (as the nearer any one is to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God the more earnest will be his desire after the full fruition of
   him,) that he might have a sight of his glory -- not of that created
   glory in the tokens of his presence and power which he had beheld, but
   of the glory of his essence and being. Through a transport of love to
   God, he would have been in heaven while he was on the earth; yea,
   desired more than heaven itself will afford, if he would have seen the
   essence of God with his corporeal eyes. In answer to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> God tells
   him, that he cannot see his face and live; none can have either bodily
   sight or direct mental intuition of the Divine Being. But this I will
   do, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> God, "I will make my glory pass before thee, and thou shalt
   see my back parts:" <reference osisRef="Exod.33.18 Exod.33.19 Exod.33.20 Exod.33.21 Exod.33.22 Exod.33.23">Exodus 33:18-23</reference>, etc.. This is all that God would
   grant, viz., such external representations of himself, in the
   proclamation of his name, and created appearances of his glory, as we
   have of a man whose back parts only we behold as he passes<note n="passeth">Auto-modernized</note> by us. But
   as to the being of God, and his subsistence in the Trinity of persons,
   we have no direct intuition into them, much less comprehension of them.
				</p><p>
   3. It is evident, therefore, that our conceptions of God, and of the
   glorious properties of his nature, are both ingenerated in us and
   regulated, under the conduct of divine revelation, by reflections of
   his glory on other things, and representations of his divine
   excellencies in the effects of them. So the invisible things of God,
   even his eternal power and Godhead, are clearly seen, being manifested
   and understood by the things that are made: <reference osisRef="Rom.1.20">Romans 1:20</reference> Yet must it be
   granted that no mere creature, not the angels above, not the heaven of
   heavens, are meet or able to receive upon them such characters of the
   divine excellencies, as to be a complete, satisfactory representation
   of the being and properties of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. They are all finite and
   limited and so cannot properly represent that which is infinite and
   immense. And this is the true reason why all worship or religious
   adoration of them is idolatry. Yet are there such effects of God's
   glory in them, such impressions of divine excellencies upon them, as we
   cannot comprehend nor search out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfection. How little do we
   conceive of the nature, glory, and power of angels! So remote are we
   from an immediate comprehension of the uncreated glory of God, as that
   we cannot fully apprehend nor conceive aright the reflection of it on
   creatures in themselves finite and limited. Hence, they thought of old,
   when they had seen an angel, that so much of the divine perfections had
   been manifested to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> they must die: <reference osisRef="Judg.13.21 Judg.13.22">Judges 13:21-22</reference> Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, they [the angels] come infinitely short of making any
   complete representation of God; nor is it otherwise with any creature
   whatever.
				</p><p>
   4. Mankind seem to have always had a common apprehension that there was
   need of a nearer and more full representation of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them than was
   made in any of the works of creation or providence. The heavens indeed
   declared his glory, and the firmament always showed his handy-work --
   the invisible things of his eternal power and Godhead were continually
   made known by the things that are made; but men generally miscarried
   and missed it in the contemplation of them, as the apostle declares,
   Rom i. For still they were influenced by a common presumption, that
   there must be a nearer and more evident manifestation of God -- that
   made by the works of creation and providence being not sufficient to
   guide them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. But in the pursuit of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> they utterly ruined
   themselves; they would do what God had not done. By common consent they
   framed representations of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves; and were so besotted
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, that they utterly lost the benefit which they might have
   received by the manifestation of him in the works of the creation, and
   took up with most foolish imaginations. For whereas they might have
   learned from thence the being of God, his infinite wisdom, power, and
   goodness -- viz., in the impressions and characters of them on the
   things that were made -- in their own representations of him, they
   "changed the glory of the invisible God into an image made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
   things:" <reference osisRef="Rom.1.23">Romans 1:23</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> this common presumption -- that there
   was no way to attain a due sense of the Divine Being but by some
   representation of it -- though true in itself, yet, by the craft of
   Satan, and foolish superstitions of the minds of men, became the
   occasion of all idolatry and flagitious wickedness in the world. Hence
   were all those epiphaneiai, or supposed "illustrious appearances" of
   their gods, which Satan deluded the Gentiles by; and hence were all the
   ways which they devised to bring God into human nature, or the likeness
   of it. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, in all the revelations that ever God made of himself,
   his mind and will, he always laid this practice of making
   representations of him under the most severe interdict and prohibition.
   And this he did evidently for these two reasons: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) Because it was a bold and foolish entrenching upon his provisional
   wisdom in the case. He had taken care that there should be a glorious
   image and representation of himself, infinitely above what any created
   wisdom could find out. But as, when Moses went into the mount, the
   Israelites would not wait for his return, but made a calf in his stead;
   so mankind -- refusing to wait for the actual exhibition of that
   glorious image of himself which God had provided -- broke in upon his
   wisdom and sovereignty, to make some of their own. For this cause was
   God so provoked, that he gave them up to such stupid blindness, that in
   those things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they thought to show themselves wise, and to bring
   God nearer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, they became contemptibly foolish -- abased their
   nature, and all the noble faculties of their minds to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> hell, and
   departed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the utmost distance from God, whom they sought to bring
   near to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Because nothing that can fall into the invention or imagination of
   men could make any other but false representations of him, and so
   substitute an idol in his place. His own immediate works have great
   characters of his divine excellencies upon them, though to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us obscure
   and not clearly legible without the light of revelation. Somewhat he
   did, of old, represent of his glorious presence -- though not of his
   being -- in the visible institutions of his worship. But all men's
   inventions to this end, which are neither divine works of nature, nor
   divine institutions of worship, are all but false representations of
   God, and therefore accursed by him.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> it is granted, that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> placed many characters of his
   divine excellencies upon his works of creation and providence -- many
   [characters] of his glorious presence upon the tabernacle and temple of
   old -- but none of these things ever did or could give such a
   representation of him as in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of men might fully
   acquiesce, or obtain such conceptions of him as might enable them to
   worship and honour him in a due manner. They cannot, I say -- by all
   that may be seen in them, and learned from them -- represent God as the
   complete object of all our affections, of all the actings of our souls
   in faith, trust, love, fear, obedience, in that way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he may be
   glorified, and we may be brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the everlasting fruition of him.
   This, therefore, is yet to be inquired after. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> --
				</p><p>
   5. A mere external doctrinal revelation of the divine nature and
   properties, without any exemplification or real representation of them,
   was not sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of God in the manifestation of himself.
   This is done in the Scripture. But the whole Scripture is built on this
   foundation, or proceeds on this supposition -- that there is a real
   representation of the divine nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, which it declares and
   describes. And as there was such a notion on the minds of all men, that
   some representation of God, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he might be near to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, was
   necessary -- which arose from the consideration of the infinite
   distance between the divine nature and their own, which allowed of no
   measures between them -- so, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the event, God himself has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   declared that, in his own way, such a representation was needful --
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end of the manifestation of himself which he designed. For --
				</p><p>
   6. All this is done in the person of Christ. He is the complete image
   and perfect representation of the Divine Being and excellencies. I do
   not speak of it absolutely, but as God proposes<note n="proposeth">Auto-modernized</note> himself as the object
   of our faith, trust, and obedience. Hence it is God, as the Father, who
   is so peculiarly represented in him and by him; as he says: "He that
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen me has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen the Father:" <reference osisRef="John.14.9">John 14:9</reference>
				</p><p>
   To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> such a representation two things are required:  (1.) That all the
   properties of the divine nature -- the knowledge of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is necessary
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our present obedience and future blessedness -- be expressed in
   it, and manifested to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. (2.) That there be, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, the nearest
   approach of the divine nature made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> it is capable, and
   which we can receive. And both these are found in the person of Christ,
   and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> alone.
				</p><p>
   In the person of Christ we consider both the constitution of it in the
   union of his natures, and the respect of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his work of mediation,
   which was the end of that constitution. And --
				</p><p>
   (1.) In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, as so considered, is there a blessed representation made
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us of all the holy properties of the nature of God -- of his
   wisdom, his power, his goodness, grace, and love, his righteousness,
   truth, and holiness, his mercy and patience. As this is affirmed
   concerning them all in general, or the glory of God in them, which is
   seen and known only in the face of Christ, so it were easy to manifest
   the same concerning every one of them in particular, by express
   testimonies of Scripture. But I shall at present confine myself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the proofs of the whole assertion which do ensue.
				</p><p>
   (2.) There is, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, the most incomprehensible approach of the
   divine nature made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> ours, such as all the imaginations of men did
   ever infinitely fall short of -- as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been before declared. In the
   assumption of our nature into personal union with himself, and our
   cognition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God thereby, with the union which believers obtain with
   him upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> -- being one in the Father and the Son, as the Father is in
   the Son, and the Son in the Father, (<reference osisRef="John.17.20 John.17.21">John 17:20-21</reference>,) -- there is
   the nearest approach of the Divine Being to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us that the nature of
   things is capable of. Both these ends were designed in those
   representations of God which were of human invention; but in both of
   them they utterly failed. For, instead of representing any of the
   glorious properties of the nature of God, they debased it, dishonoured
   it, and filled the minds of men with vile conceptions of it; and
   instead of bringing God nearer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, they put themselves at an
   infinite moral distance from him. But my design is the confirmation of
   our assertions from the Scripture.
				</p><p>
   "He is the image of the invisible God:" <reference osisRef="Col.1.15">Colossians 1:15</reference> This title or
   property of "invisible," the apostle here gives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, to show what
   need there was of an image or representation of him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as well as
   of one in whom he would declare the counsels of his will. For he
   intends not only the absolute invisibility of his essence, but his
   being unknown to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in himself. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, (as was before observed,)
   mankind was generally prone to make visible representations of this
   invisible God, that, in them, they might contemplate on him and have
   him present with them, as they foolishly imagined. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the craft of
   Satan abusing this inclination of mankind, idolatry owes its original
   and progress in the world: nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, necessary it was that this
   invisible God should be so represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by some image of him, as
   that we might know him, and that in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> he might be worshipped
   according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own mind and will. But this must be of his own
   contrivance -- an effect of his own infinite wisdom. Hence, as he
   absolutely rejects<note n="rejecteth">Auto-modernized</note> all images and representations of him of men's
   devisings, (for the reasons before mentioned,) and declares that the
   honour that any should think would thereby redound to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him was not
   given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, but to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the devil; so that which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided
   himself, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own holy ends and purposes, is every way approved of
   him. For he will have "all men honour the Son, even as they honour the
   Father;" and so as that "he who honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> not the God, honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   the Father:" <reference osisRef="John.5.23">John 5:23</reference>
				</p><p>
   This image, therefore, is the person of Christ; "he is the image of the
   invisible God." This, in the first place, respects the divine person
   absolutely, as he is the essential image of the Father: which must
   briefly be declared.
				</p><p>
   1. The Son is sometimes said to be en Patri, "in the Father," and the
   Father in the Son: "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the
   Father in me?" <reference osisRef="John.14.10">John 14:10</reference> This is from the unity or sameness of
   their nature -- for he and the Father are one: <reference osisRef="John.10.30">John 10:30</reference> Thence all
   things that the Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> are his, <reference osisRef="John.16.15">John 16:15</reference>, because their
   nature is one and the same. With respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine essence
   absolutely considered, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the Father is in the Son, and the Son in
   the Father, the one cannot be said to be the image of the other. For he
   and the Father are one; and one and the same thing cannot be the image
   of itself, in that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is one.
				</p><p>
   2. The Son is said not only to be en Patri, "in the Father," in the
   unity of the same essence; but also pros ton Patera or Theon, "with the
   Father," or "with God," in the distinction of his person: "The Word was
   with God, and the Word was God:" <reference osisRef="John.1.1">John 1:1</reference> "The Word was God," in the
   unity of the divine essence -- and "the Word was with God," in its
   distinct personal subsistence. "The Word" -- that is, the person of the
   Son, as distinct from the Father -- "was with God," or the Father. And
   in this respect he is the essential image of the Father, as he is
   called in this place, and <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>; and that because he partakes of
   all the same divine properties with the Father.
				</p><p>
   But although the Father, on the other side, be partaker of all the
   essential divine properties of the Son, yet is not he said to be the
   image of the Son. For this property of an image respects not the things
   themselves, but the manner of the participation of them. Now the Son
   receives all from the Father, and the Father nothing from the Son.
   Whatever belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of the Son, as the person of the Son,
   he receives it all from the Father by eternal generation: "For as the
   Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> life in himself, so has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son to have life
   in himself:" <reference osisRef="John.5.26">John 5:26</reference> He is therefore the essential image of the
   Father, because all the properties of the divine nature are
   communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him together with personality -- from the Father.
				</p><p>
   3. In his incarnation, the Son was made the representative image of God
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- as he was, in his person, the essential image of the Father,
   by eternal generation. The invisible God -- whose nature and divine
   excellencies our understandings can make no approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> in
   him represent, exhibit, or make present to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our faith and spiritual
   sense, both himself and all the glorious excellencies of his nature.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, may be considered
   three ways.
				</p><p>
   1. Merely with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his divine nature. This is one and the same
   with that of the Father. In this respect the one is not the image of
   the other, for both are the same.
				</p><p>
   2. With respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his divine person as the Son of the Father, the
   only-begotten, the eternal Son of God. Thus he receives, as his
   personality, so all divine excellencies, from the Father; so he is the
   essential image of the Father's person.
				</p><p>
   3. As he took our nature upon him, or in the assumption of our nature
   into personal union with himself, in order to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the work of his
   mediation. So is he the only representative image of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- in
   whom alone we see, know, and learn all the divine excellencies -- so as
   to live to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and be directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of him. All this
   himself instructs us in.
				</p><p>
   He reflects it on the Pharisees, as an effect of their blindness and
   ignorance, that they had neither heard the voice of God at any time,
   nor seen his shape: <reference osisRef="John.5.37">John 5:37</reference> And in opposition to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he tells his
   disciples, that they had known the Father, and seen him: <reference osisRef="John.14.7">John 14:7</reference>
   And the reason he gives of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> is, because they that knew him, knew
   the Father also. And when one of his disciples, not yet sufficiently
   instructed in this mystery, replied, "Lord, show us the Father, and it
   suffices<note n="sufficeth">Auto-modernized</note> us," verse 8, his answer is, "Have I been so long time with
   you, and yet hast thou not known me? he that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen me has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen the
   Father:" verse 9.
				</p><p>
   Three things are required to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the justification of this assertion.
				</p><p>
   1. That the Father and he be of the same nature, have the same essence
   and being. For otherwise it would not follow that he who had seen him
   had seen the Father also. This ground of it he declares in the next
   verse: "The Father is in me, and I am in the Father" namely, because
   they were one in nature and essence. For the divine nature being simply
   the same in them all, the divine persons are in each other, by virtue
   of the oneness of that nature.
				</p><p>
   2. That he be distinct from him. For otherwise there cannot be a seeing
   of the Father by the seeing of him. He is seen in the Son as
   represented by him -- as his image -- the Word -- the Son of the
   Father, as he was with God. The unity of nature and the distinction of
   persons is the ground of that assertion of our Saviour: "He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   seen me, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen the Father also."
				</p><p>
   3. But, moreover, the Lord Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a respect in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself,
   in his entire person as he was incarnate, and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   discharge of his mediatory work. "Have I been so long time with you,
   and hast thou not known me?" Whilst he was with them, dwelt among them,
   conversed with them, he was the great representative of the glory of
   God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. And, notwithstanding this particular mistake, they did
   then see his glory, "the glory of the only-begotten of the Father:"
   <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference> And in him was manifested the glory of the Father. He "is
   the image of the invisible God." In him God was, in him he dwelt, in
   him is he known, in him is he worshipped according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own will,
   in him is there a nearer approach made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by the divine nature
   than ever could enter into the heart of man to conceive. In the
   constitution of his person -- of two natures, so infinitely distinct
   and separate in themselves -- and in the work it was designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, the
   wisdom, power, goodness, love, grace, mercy, holiness, and faithfulness
   of God, are manifested to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. This is the one blessed "image of the
   invisible God," in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we may learn, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we may contemplate and
   adore, all his divine perfections.
				</p><p>
   The same truth is testified to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference> God spoke to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the
   Son, who is "the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
   person." His divine nature is here included, as that without which he
   could not have made a perfect representation of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. For the
   apostle speaks of him, as of him "by whom the worlds were made," and
   who "upholds<note n="upholdeth">Auto-modernized</note> all things by the word of his power." Yet does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he not
   speak of him absolutely as he was God, but also as he who "in himself
   purged our sins, and sat down at the right hand of the majesty on
   high;" that is, in his whole person. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he is apaugasma tes doxes,
   the effulgency, the resplendency of divine glory, that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   divine glory shines forth in an evident manifestation of itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us. And as a farther explication of the same mystery, it is added, that
   he is the character or "express image" of the person of the Father.
   Such an impression of all the glorious properties of God is on him, as
   that thereby they become legible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all them that believe.
				</p><p>
   So the same apostle affirms again that he is the "image of God," <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.4">2 Corinthians 4:4</reference>; in what sense, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what end, he declares, verse 6: "We have
   the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Still
   it is supposed that the glory of God, as essentially in him, is
   invisible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and incomprehensible by us. Yet is there a knowledge
   of it necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, that we may live to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   enjoyment of him. This we obtain only in the face or person of Christ
   -- en prosopo tou Christou; for in him that glory is represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us.
				</p><p>
   This was the testimony which the apostles gave concerning him, when he
   dwelt among them in the days of his flesh. They saw "his glory, the
   glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth:"
   <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference> The divine glory was manifest in him, and in him they saw
   the glory of the Father. So the same apostle witnesses again, who
   recorded this testimony: "For the life was manifested, and we have seen
   it, and bear witness, and show to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you that eternal life which was
   with the Father, and was manifested to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us:" <reference osisRef="1John.1.2">1 John 1:2</reference> In the Son
   incarnate, that eternal life which was originally in and with the
   Father was manifest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   It may be said, that the Scripture itself is sufficient for this end of
   the declaration of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, so that there is no need of any other
   representation of him; and [that] these things serve only to turn the
   minds of men from learning the mind and will of God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, to seek
   for all in the person of Christ. But the true end of proposing these
   things is, to draw men to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the diligent study of the Scripture,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> alone they are revealed and declared. And in its proper use,
   and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its proper end, it is perfect and most sufficient. It is logos
   tou Theou -- "the word of God;" nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> it is not logos ousiodes, the
   internal, essential Word of God -- but logos prophorikos, the external
   word spoken by him. It is not, therefore, nor can be, the image of God,
   either essential or representative; but is the revelation and
   declaration of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, without which we can know nothing of it.
				</p><p>
   Christ is the image of the invisible God, the express image of the
   person of the Father; and the principal end of the whole Scripture,
   especially of the gospel, is to declare him so to be, and how he is so.
   What God promised by his prophets in the holy Scriptures concerning his
   Son, Jesus Christ, that is fully declared in the Gospel: <reference osisRef="Rom.1.1 Rom.1.2 Rom.1.3 Rom.1.4">Romans 1:1-4</reference>
   The gospel is the declaration of Christ as "the power of God, and the
   wisdom of God," <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.23 1Cor.1.24">1 Corinthians 1:23-24</reference>; or an evident representation of God
   in his person and mediation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us: <reference osisRef="Gal.3.1">Galatians 3:1</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> three
   things are in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> to be considered.
				</p><p>
   1. "Objectum reale et formale fidei" -- "the real, formal object of our
   faith in this matter. This is the person of Christ, the Son of God
   incarnate, the representative image of the glory of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; as in
   the testimonies insisted on.
				</p><p>
   2. "Medium revelans", or "lumen deferens" -- the means of its
   revelation, or the objective light through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the perception and knowledge
   of it is conveyed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our minds. This is the gospel; compared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a
   glass because of the prospect which we have of the image of God
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>: <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> But without it -- by any other means, and not
   by it -- we can behold nothing of this image of God.
				</p><p>
   3. "Lumen pr�parans, elevans, disponens subjectum" -- "the internal
   light of the mind in the saving illumination of the Holy Spirit,
   enabling us -- by that means, and in the use of it -- spiritually to
   behold and discern the glory of God in the face of Christ: <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   Through both these, in their several ways of operation, there
   proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> -- from the real object of our faith, Christ, as the image
   of God -- a transforming power, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the soul is changed into the
   same image, or is made conformable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ; which is that to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>
   we are predestinated. But we may yet a little farther contemplate on
   these things, in some instances in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God and our own
   duty are concerned.
				</p><p>
   1. The glory of God's wisdom is exalted, and the pride of the
   imaginations of men is proportionally debased. And in these two
   consists the real foundation of all religion in our souls. This God
   designed in the dispensation of himself and his will, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.29 1Cor.1.31">1 Corinthians 1:29, 31</reference>;
   this he calls us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Isa.2.22">Isaiah 2:22</reference>; <reference osisRef="Zech.2.13">Zechariah 2:13</reference> As this frame of
   heart is prevalent in us, so do all other graces shine and flourish.
   And it is that which influences all our duties, so far as they are
   acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. And there is no truth more instructive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it
   than that before us. It is taken for granted -- and the event has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   demonstrated it to be so -- that some express representation should be
   made of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we might contemplate the glorious
   excellencies of his nature, and he might draw nigh to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and be
   present with us. This, therefore, men attempted to effect and
   accomplish; and this God alone has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> performed, and could so do. And
   their several ways for this end are in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> manifest. As the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done it is the principal exaltation of his infinite wisdom and
   goodness, (as shall be immediately more fully declared,) so the way
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> men attempted it was the highest instance of wickedness and
   folly. It is, as we have declared, in Christ alone that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done
   it. And that in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> exalted and manifested the riches, the
   treasures of his infinite wisdom and goodness, is that which the
   Gospel, the Spirit, and the church, do give testimony to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. A more
   glorious effect of divine wisdom and goodness, a more illustrious
   manifestation of them, there never was, nor ever shall be, than in the
   finding out and constitution of this way of the representation of God
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. The ways of men, for the same end, were so far from giving a
   right representation of the perfections of the divine nature, that they
   were all of them below, beneath, and unworthy of our own. For in
   nothing did the blindness, darkness, and folly of our nature, in its
   depraved condition, ever so exert and evidence themselves, as in
   contriving ways for the representation of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- that is, in
   idolatry, the worst and vilest of evils: so <reference osisRef="Ps.115.4 Ps.115.5 Ps.115.6 Ps.115.7 Ps.115.8">Psalms 115:4-8</reference>; Isa. xliv.;
   <reference osisRef="Rev.9.19 Rev.9.20">Revelation of John 9:19-20</reference>, etc.. This pride and folly of men was that which lost
   all knowledge of God in the world, and all obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. The ten
   commandments are but a transcript of the light and law of nature. The
   first of these required that God -- the only true God -- the Creator
   and Governor of all -- should be acknowledged, worshipped, believed in,
   and obeyed. And the second was, that we should not make to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> ourselves
   any image or representation of him. Whatever he would do himself, yet
   he strictly forbade that we should make any such to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> ourselves. And
   here began the apostasy of the world from God. They did not absolutely
   reject him, and so cast off the first fundamental precept of the law of
   nature -- but they submitted not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his wisdom and authority in the
   next, which was evidently educed from it. They would make images and
   representations of him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves; and by this invention of their
   own, they first dishonoured him, and then forsook him, giving
   themselves up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the rule and service of the devil. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as the
   way that God in infinite wisdom found out for the representation of
   himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, was the only means of recovery from the first apostasy
   -- the way found out by men, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same end, was the great means of
   casting the generality of mankind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the farthest degree of a new
   apostasy from God of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> our nature is capable. And of the same kind
   will all our contrivances be found to be -- in what belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   worship and glory -- though, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, they may appear both pious and
   necessary. This, therefore, should lead us into a continual admiration
   of the wisdom and grace of God, with a due sense of our own vileness
   and baseness by nature. For we are in nothing better or wiser than they
   who fell into the utmost folly and wickedness, in their designs for the
   highest end, or the representation of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. The more we dwell on
   such considerations, the more fear and reverence of God, with faith,
   trust, and delight in him, will be increased -- as also humility in
   ourselves, with a sense of divine grace and love.
				</p><p>
   2. There is a peculiar ground of the spiritual efficacy of this
   representation of God. The revelations that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of himself,
   and of the glorious properties of his nature, in the works of creation
   and providence, are, in themselves, clear, plain, and manifest: <reference osisRef="Ps.19.1 Ps.19.2">Psalms 19:1-2</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.1.19 Rom.1.20">Romans 1:19-20</reference> Those which are made in Christ are sublime
   and mysterious. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, the knowledge we have of him as he is
   represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in Christ is far more clear, certain, steady,
   effectual and operative, than any we can attain in and by all other
   ways of revelation. The reason of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is, not only because there is a
   more full and extensive revelation made of God, his counsels and his
   will, in Christ and the Gospel, than in all the works of creation and
   providence; but because this revelation and representation of God is
   received by faith alone, the other by reason only: and it is faith that
   is the principle of spiritual light and life in us. What is received
   thereby is operative and effectual, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the ends of the life of
   God. For we live by faith here, as we shall by sight hereafter. Reason
   alone -- especially as it is corrupted and depraved -- can discern no
   glory in the representation of God by Christ; yea, all that is spoken
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, or declared in the Gospel, is foolishness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. Hence many
   live in a profession of the faith of the letter of the Gospel, yet --
   having no light, guide, nor conduct, but that of reason -- they do not,
   they cannot, really behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ; nor has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the revelation of it any efficacy upon their souls.
   The manifestation of him in the light of nature, by the works of
   creation and providence, is suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their reason, and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> affect
   it: for that [manifestation] which is made in Christ, they say of it,
   as the Israelites did of manna, that came down from heaven, "What is
   it?" we know not the meaning of it. For it is made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faith alone,
   and all men have not faith. And where God shines into the heart, by
   that faith which is of divine operation -- there, with "open face, we
   behold the glory of God, as in a glass;" or have the knowledge of the
   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. There is not the meanest
   believer, but -- in the real exercise of faith in Christ -- has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> more
   glorious apprehensions of God, his wisdom, goodness, and grace, of all
   his glorious excellencies, than the most learned and wise in the world
   can attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, in the exercise of reason on the proper objects of it.
   So are these things opposed by the apostle, 1 Cor. i. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, faith
   in Christ is the only means of the true knowledge of God; and the
   discoveries which are made of him and his excellencies thereby are
   those alone which are effectual to conform us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his image and
   likeness. And this is the reason why some men are so little affected
   with the Gospel -- notwithstanding the continual preaching of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them, and their outward profession of it. It does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not inwardly affect
   them, it produces<note n="produceth">Auto-modernized</note> no blessed effects in them. Some sense they have of
   the power of God in the works of creation and providence, in his rule
   and government, and in the workings of natural conscience. Beyond
   these, they have no real sense of him. The reason is, because they have
   not faith -- through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> alone the representation that is made of God in
   Christ, and declared in the gospel, is made effectual to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of
   men. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> --
				</p><p>
   3. It is the highest degeneracy from the mystery of the Christian
   religion, for men to satisfy themselves in natural discoveries of the
   Divine Being and excellencies, without an acquaintance with that
   perfect declaration and representation of them which is made in the
   person of Christ, as he is revealed and declared in the Gospel. It is
   confessed that there may be good use made of the evidence which reason
   gives or takes from its own innate principles -- with the consideration
   of the external works of divine wisdom and power -- concerning the
   being and rule of God. But to rest in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> -- to esteem it the best and
   most perfective knowledge of God that we can attain -- not to rise up
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the more full, perfect, and evident manifestation of himself that
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made in Christ -- is a declaration of our unbelief, and a
   virtual renunciation of the Gospel. This is the spring of that
   declension to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a mere natural religion which discovers itself in many,
   and usually ends in the express denial of the divine person of Christ.
   For when the proper use of it is despised, on what grounds can the
   notion of it be long retained? But a supposition of his divine person
   is the foundation of this discourse. Were he not the essential image of
   the Father in his own divine person, he could not be the representative
   image of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us as he is incarnate. For if he were a man only --
   however miraculously produced and gloriously exalted, yet the angels
   above, the glorious heavens, the seat and throne of God, with other
   effects of creating power and wisdom, would no less represent his glory
   than it could be done in him. Yet are they nowhere, nowhere, jointly
   nor separately, styled "the image of the invisible God" -- "the
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person;" nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   God shine into our hearts to give us the knowledge of his glory in the
   face of them. And it argues the woeful enmity of the carnal mind
   against God and all the effects of his wisdom, that, whereas he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   granted us such a glorious image and representation of himself, we like
   it not, we delight not in the contemplation of it, but either despise
   it or neglect it, and please ourselves in that which is incomparably
   beneath it.
				</p><p>
   4. Because God is not thus known it is -- that the knowledge of him is
   so barren and fruitless in the world, as it manifests itself to be. It
   were easy to produce, yea, endless to number the testimonies that might
   be produced out of heathen writers, given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the being and existence
   of God, his authority, monarchy, and rule; yet what were the effects of
   that knowledge which they had? Besides that wretched idolatry in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   they were all immersed, as the apostle declares, Rom. i., it rescued
   them from no kind of wickedness and villany; as he there also
   manifests. And the virtues which were found among them were evidently
   derived from other causes, and not from the knowledge they had of God.
   The Jews have the knowledge of God by the letter of the Old Testament;
   but they -- not knowing him in Christ, and having lost all sense and
   apprehension of those representations which were made of his being in
   him, in the Law -- they continue universally a people carnal,
   obstinate, and wicked. They have neither the virtues of the heathens
   among them, nor the power of the truth of religion. As it was with them
   of old, so it, yet continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> to be; "they profess that they know God,
   but in works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and to
   every good work reprobate:" <reference osisRef="Titus.1.16">Titus 1:16</reference> So is it among many that are
   called Christians at this day in the world: great pretence there is
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the knowledge of God -- yet did flagitious sins and wickedness
   scarce ever more abound among the heathens themselves. It is the
   knowledge of "God in Christ" alone that is effectually powerful to work
   the souls of men into a conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Those alone who behold the
   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ are changed into the same
   image, from glory to glory.

<title>Chapter 6 The Person of Christ the great Repository of Sacred Truth -- Its Relation to that.</title>
<p>   Divine supernatural truth is called by the apostle, "The truth which is
   after godliness:" <reference osisRef="Titus.1.1">Titus 1:1</reference> Whereas, therefore, the person of Christ
   is the great mystery of godliness, we must, in the next place, inquire
   -- What is the relation of spiritual supernatural truth to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>? And
   this I shall do, in pursuit of what was proposed in the foregoing
   chapter, viz., that he is the great representative to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, of
   God, his holy properties, and the counsels of his will?
				</p><p>
   All divine truth may be referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> two heads. First, that which is
   essentially so; and then that which is so declaratively. The first is
   God himself, the other is the counsel of his will.
				</p><p>
   First, God himself is the first and only essential Truth, in whose
   being and nature the springs of all truth do lie. Whatever is truth --
   so far as it is so, derives from him, is an emanation from that eternal
   fountain of it. Being, truth, and goodness, is the principal notion of
   God; and in him they are all the same. How this is represented in
   Christ -- as in himself he is the essential image of the Father, and as
   incarnate the representative image of him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   declared.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, The counsels of God are the next spring and cause -- as also
   the subject-matter or substance -- of all truth that is so
   declaratively. Divine truth is "the declaration of the counsel of God:"
   <reference osisRef="Acts.20.27">Acts 20:27</reference> Of them all the person of Christ is the sacred repository
   and treasury -- in him are they to be learned. All their efficacy and
   use depend on their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. He is the centre and
   circumference of all the lines of truth -- that is, which is divine,
   spiritual, and supernatural. And the beauty of it is presented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us
   only in his face or person. We see it not, we know it not, but as God
   shines into our hearts to give us the knowledge of it in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>: <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   So he testifies<note n="testifieth">Auto-modernized</note> of himself, "I am the truth:" <reference osisRef="John.14.6">John 14:6</reference> He is so
   essentially -- as he is one with the Father, the God of truth: <reference osisRef="Deut.32.4">Deuteronomy 32:4</reference> He is so efficiently -- as by him alone it is fully and
   effectually declared; for "no man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen God at any time; the
   only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> declared
   him:" <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference> He is so substantially -- in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   types and shadows of the Old Testament; for in him dwelt "the fulness
   of the godhead bodily:" <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference> "The body is of Christ:" verse 17.
   He is so subjectively -- for all divine truth, relating to the saving
   knowledge of God, is treasured up in him. "In him are hid all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge:"verse 3 . That is, the wisdom and
   knowledge of God -- in his counsels concerning the vocation,
   sanctification, and salvation, of the church -- concerning which the
   apostle falls into that holy admiration, "O the depth of the riches
   both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" <reference osisRef="Rom.11.33">Romans 11:33</reference> And they are
   called "treasures" on a twofold account, both mentioned together by the
   Psalmist. "How precious are thy thoughts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> me, O Lord; how great is
   the sum of them!" They are treasures, because precious and invaluable
   -- and are therefore usually preferred above all earthly treasures
   which men most highly esteem: <reference osisRef="Prov.3.14 Prov.3.15">Proverbs 3:14-15</reference> And they are so,
   because of the greatness of the sum of them; and therefore also called
   "unsearchable riches:" <reference osisRef="Eph.3.8">Ephesians 3:8</reference> These precious, unsearchable
   treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God -- that is, all divine
   supernatural truths -- are hid, or safely deposited, in Christ -- in
   and from whom alone they are to be learned and received.
				</p><p>
   So we are said to learn the truth as it is in Jesus: <reference osisRef="Eph.4.21">Ephesians 4:21</reference> And
   the knowledge of all evangelical sacred truth is, in the Scripture,
   most frequently expressed by the knowledge of Him: <reference osisRef="John.8.19">John 8:19</reference>; xvii.
   3; <reference osisRef="2Cor.2.14">2 Corinthians 2:14</reference>; iv. 5, 6; <reference osisRef="Eph.1.17">Ephesians 1:17</reference>; <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8 Phil.3.10">Philippians 3:8, 10</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.1.1 1John.1.2">1 John 1:1-2</reference>; ii. 4, ii. 13, 14; v. 20<reference osisRef="2Pet.2.20">2 Peter 2:20</reference>
				</p><p>
   Setting aside what we have discoursed and proved before -- concerning
   the laying of the foundation of all the counsels of God in the person
   of Christ, and the representation of them in the ineffable constitution
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> -- I shall give some few instances of this relation of all
   supernatural truths to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- manifesting that we cannot learn them,
   nor know them, but with a due respect to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   1. There are two things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of truth does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist. (1.)
   Its light. (2) Its efficacy or power. And both these do all
   supernatural truths derive from this relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ.
				</p><p>
   (1.) No truth whatever brings any spiritual light to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the mind, but by
   virtue of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. "In him is life, and the life is the light of men:"
   <reference osisRef="John.1.4">John 1:4</reference> He is "the true Light, which lights<note n="lighteth">Auto-modernized</note> every man that comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note>
   into the world:" verse 9. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as truth is the only means of
   illumination, so it cannot communicate any light to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the mind, but
   only as it is a beam from him, as it is an organ to convey it from that
   fountain. Separated from him and its relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, it will not
   retain, it cannot communicate, any real spiritual light or
   understanding to the souls of men. How should it, if all light be
   originally in him -- as the Scripture testifies<note n="testifieth">Auto-modernized</note>? Then alone is the
   mind irradiated with heavenly truth, when it is received as proceeding
   from, and leading to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, the Sun of Righteousness -- the blessed spring
   of all spiritual light -- which is Christ himself. Whatever notional
   knowledge men may have of divine truths, as they are doctrinally
   proposed in the Scripture, yet -- if they know them not in their
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ as the foundation of the counsels of
   God -- if they discern not how they proceed from him, and centre in him
   -- they will bring no spiritual, saving light to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their understanding.
   For all spiritual life and light is in him, and from him alone. An
   instance of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> we have in the Jews. They have the Scriptures of the
   Old Testament, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the substance of all divine truth is revealed
   and expressed; and they are diligent in the study of them; nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>
   their minds are not at all illuminated nor irradiated by the truths
   contained in them, but they live and walk in horrible darkness. And the
   only reason of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is, because they know not, because they reject, the
   relation of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ -- without which they are deprived of all
   enlightening power.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Efficacy or power is the second property of divine truth. And the
   end of this efficacy is to make us like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God: <reference osisRef="Eph.4.20 Eph.4.21 Eph.4.22 Eph.4.23 Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:20-24</reference> The
   mortification of sin, the renovation of our natures, the sanctification
   of our minds, hearts, and affections, the consolation of our souls,
   with their edification in all the parts of the life of God, and the
   like, are the things that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> designed to effect by his truth;
   (<reference osisRef="John.17.17">John 17:17</reference>;) from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it is able to "build us up, and give us an
   inheritance among all them that are sanctified:" <reference osisRef="Acts.20.32">Acts 20:32</reference> But it is
   from their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ that they have any thing
   of this power and efficacy. For they have it no otherwise but as they
   are conveyances of his grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of men. So <reference osisRef="1John.1.1 1John.1.2">1 John 1:1-2</reference>
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as professors of the truth, if separated from Christ as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   real union, are withering branches -- so truths professed, if
   doctrinally separated from him, or their respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, have no
   living power or efficacy in the souls of men. When Christ is formed in
   the heart by them, when he dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> plentifully in the soul through
   their operation, then, and not else, do they put forth their proper
   power and efficacy. Otherwise, they are as waters separated from the
   fountain -- they quickly dry up or become a noisome puddle; or as a
   beam interrupted from its continuity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the sun -- it is immediately
   deprived of light.
				</p><p>
   2. All divine spiritual truths are declarative, either of the grace and
   love of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, or [of] our duty, obedience, and gratitude to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him. But, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these things, Christ is all and in all; we can have
   no due apprehensions of the love and grace of God, no understanding of
   the divine truths of the Word -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are revealed, and through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   they are exhibited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that believe -- but in the exercise of
   faith on Christ himself. For in, by, and from him alone, it is that
   they are proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, that we are made partakers of them. It is
   from his fulness that all grace is received. No truth concerning them
   can, by any imagination, be separated from him. He is the life and soul
   of all such truths -- without which, they, as they are written in the
   Word, are but a dead letter, and that of such a character as is
   illegible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any real discovery of the grace and love of
   God. And as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those of the other sort, which are instructive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us
   in our duty, obedience, and gratitude -- we cannot come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a
   practical compliance with any one of them, but by the aids of grace
   received from him. For without him we can do nothing; (<reference osisRef="John.15.5">John 15:5</reference>;) and
   he alone understands divine truth who does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note> it: <reference osisRef="John.7.17">John 7:17</reference> There is
   not, therefore, any one text of Scripture which presses<note n="presseth">Auto-modernized</note> our duty to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, that we can so understand as to perform that duty in an acceptable
   manner, without an actual regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, from whom alone we
   receive ability for the performance of it, and in or through whom alone
   it is accepted with God.
				</p><p>
   3. All the evidence of divine spiritual truth, and all the foundation
   of our real interest in the things of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> it is a declaration -- as to
   benefit, advantage, and comfort -- depend on their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ. We may take an instance in one article of divine truth, which
   seems to be most disengaged from any such relation, namely, the
   resurrection of the dead. But there is no man who rightly believes or
   comprehends this truth, who does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it not upon the evidence given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it, and example of it, in the person of Christ rising from the dead.
   Nor can any man have a comfortable expectation or faith of a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>
   interest in a blessed resurrection, (which is our whole concern in that
   truth, <reference osisRef="Phil.3.11">Philippians 3:11</reference>,) but by virtue of a mystical union to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, as
   the head of the church that shall be raised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> glory. Both these the
   apostle inserts upon at large, 1 Cor. xv. So is it with all other
   truths whatever.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, all divine supernatural truths revealed in the Scripture,
   being nothing but the declaration of these counsels of God, whose
   foundation was laid in the person of Christ; and whereas they are all
   of them expressive of the love, wisdom, goodness, and grace of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, or instructive in our obedience and duty to him -- all the actings
   of God towards us, and all ours towards him, being in and through him
   alone; and whereas all the life and power of these truths, all their
   beauty, symmetry, and harmony in their union and union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note>, which is
   expressive of divine wisdom, is all from him, who, as a living spirit
   diffused through the whole system, both acts and animates it -- all the
   treasures of truth, wisdom, and knowledge, may be well said to be hid
   in him. And we may consider some things that ensue upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   1. Hence it is, that those who reject the divine person of Christ --
   who believe it not, who discern not the wisdom, grace, love, and power
   of God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> -- do constantly reject or corrupt all other spiritual
   truths of divine revelation. Nor can it otherwise be. For they have a
   consistency only in their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the mystery of godliness --
   "God manifest in the flesh" -- and from thence derive their sense and
   meaning. This being removed -- the truth, in all other articles of
   religion, immediately falls to the ground. An instance of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> we have
   in the Socinians. For, although they retain the common notions of the
   unity and existence of the divine nature, which are indelibly fixed on
   the minds of men, yet is there no one truth that belongs peculiarly
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Christian religion, but they either deny it or horribly
   deprave it. Many things concerning God and his essential properties --
   as his immutability, immensity, prescience -- they have greatly
   perverted. So is that fulfilled in them which was spoken by Jude the
   apostle, verse 10. They "speak evil of those things which they know
   not: and what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
   they corrupt themselves." So they do in the things mentioned, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   there are natural notions in the minds of men; but of evangelical
   truths -- which they know not -- they speak evil, and deride them. The
   holy Trinity they blaspheme -- the incarnation of the Son of God they
   scorn -- the work of his mediation in his oblation and intercession,
   with the satisfaction and merit of his obedience and suffering, they
   reject. So do they [reject] whatever we are taught of the depravation
   of our natures by the fall, of the renovation of them by the Holy
   Ghost; and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all other articles of our faith do they offer violence,
   to corrupt them. The beginning of their transgression or apostasy, is
   in a disbelief of the divine person of Christ. That being rejected, all
   other sacred truths are removed from their basis and centre, [from]
   that which gives them their unity and harmony. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> they fluctuate up
   and down in the minds of men, and, appearing to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them under various
   deceiving colours, are easily misapprehended or disbelieved. Yea, there
   can no direct, proper representation be made of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   understandings of men. Dissolve the knot, centre, and harmony in the
   most beautiful composition or structure -- and every part will
   contribute as much to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the deformity and ruin of the whole, as it did
   before to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its beauty and consistency. So is it with every doctrine --
   so is it with the whole system of evangelical truths. Take the person
   of Christ out of them, dissolve their harmony in relation to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> --
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we no longer hold the Head in the faith and profession of them
   -- and the minds of men cannot deliver them from an irreconcilable
   difference among themselves. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> some of them are immediately
   rejected, and some of them corrupted; for they lose their native light
   and beauty. They will neither agree nor consist any where but in
   Christ. Hence it is that no instance can be given of any, who, from the
   original of the Christian religion, rejected the divine person of
   Christ, and preserved any one evangelical truth besides, pure and
   uncorrupted. And I do freely confess, that all which we believe
   concerning the holy Trinity, the eternal counsels of God, the efficacy
   of the mediation of Christ, his satisfaction and merit, the way which
   we own of the sanctification, justification, and salvation of the
   church -- are to be esteemed fables, as the Socinians contend, if what
   we believe concerning the person of Christ be so also.
				</p><p>
   2. Hence it is that the knowledge and profession of the truth, with
   many, is so fruitless, inefficacious, and useless. It is not known, it
   is not understood nor believed -- in its relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ; on which
   account alone it conveys either light or power to the soul. Men profess
   they know the truth; but they know it not in its proper order, in its
   harmony and use. It leads them not to Christ, it brings not Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them; and so is lifeless and useless. Hence, ofttimes, none are more
   estranged from the life of God than such as have much notional
   knowledge of the doctrines of the Scripture. For they are all of them
   useless, and subject to be abused, if they are not improved to form
   Christ in the soul, and transform the whole person into his likeness
   and image. This they will not effect where their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him is
   not understood -- where they are not received and learned as a
   revelation of him, with the mystery of the will and wisdom of God in
   him. For whereas he is our life, and in our living to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God we do not
   so much live as he lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note> in us, and the life which we lead in the
   flesh is by the faith of him -- so that we have neither principle nor
   power of spiritual life, but in, by, and from him -- whatever knowledge
   we have of the truth, if it do not effect a union between him and our
   souls, it will be lifeless in us, and unprofitable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. It is
   learning the truth as it is in Jesus, which alone renews<note n="reneweth">Auto-modernized</note> the image of
   God in us: <reference osisRef="Eph.4.21 Eph.4.22 Eph.4.23 Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:21-24</reference> Where it is otherwise -- where men have
   notions of evangelical truths, but know not Christ in them -- whatever
   they profess, when they come really to examine themselves, they will
   find them of no use to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, but that all things between God and
   their souls are stated on natural light and common presumptions.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 7 Power and Efficacy Communicated to the Office of Christ for the Salvation of the Church from his Person">
<title>Chapter 7 Power and Efficacy Communicated to the Office of Christ, for the Salvation of the Church, from his Person.</title>
<p>   It is by the exercise and discharge of the office of Christ -- as the
   king, priest, and prophet of the church -- that we are redeemed,
   sanctified, and saved. Thereby does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he immediately communicate all
   Gospel benefits to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- give us an access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God here by grace,
   and in glory hereafter; for he saves us, as he is the mediator between
   God and man. But upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> an inquiry may be made -- from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it is that the
   acts and duties of this office of Christ, in their exercise and
   discharge, should have such a power and efficacy, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   their supernatural and eternal ends; for the things which depend upon
   them, which are effected by them, are all the principal means of the
   glory of God, and the only concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of the souls of men. And this,
   I say, is his holy, mysterious person; from thence alone all power and
   efficacy is derived, and transfused into his offices, and into all that
   is due in the discharge of them.
				</p><p>
   A truth this is, of that importance, that the declaration and
   demonstration of it is the principal design of one entire book of the
   holy Scriptures, viz., of the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Hebrews. That the glorious excellency of the person of Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   enable him, in the discharge of his offices, to accomplish those ends,
   -- which none other, though vested with the same offices, could, in the
   exercise of them, attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> -- is the sum and substance of the
   doctrinal part of that discourse. Here, therefore, we must a little fix
   our meditations -- and our interest calls us to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. For if it be
   so, it is evident that we can receive no good, no benefit, by virtue of
   any office of Christ, nor any fruits of their exercise, without an
   actual respect of faith to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> all their life and
   power is derived.
				</p><p>
   God gave of old both kings, priests, and prophets, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church. He
   both anointed them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their offices, directed them in their
   discharge, was present with them in their work, and accepted of their
   duties; yet by none of them, nor by all of them together, was the
   church supernaturally enlightened, internally ruled, or eternally
   saved: nor could it so be. Some of them -- as Moses in particular --
   had as much power, and as great a presence of God with him, as any mere
   man could be made partaker of; yet was he not, in his ministry, the
   saviour of the church -- nor could he be so any otherwise than
   typically and temporally. The ministry of them all was subservient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   that end which, by its own power, it could not attain.
				</p><p>
   It is evident, therefore, that the redemption and salvation of the
   church do not depend merely on this -- that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given one to be
   the king, priest, and prophet of the church, by the actings of which
   offices it is redeemed and saved; but on the person of him who was so
   given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us: as is fully attested, <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6 Isa.9.7">Isaiah 9:6-7</reference>
				</p><p>
   This must be declared.
				</p><p>
   Two things were required, in general, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, that
   his offices might be effectual to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the salvation of the church, and
   without which they could not so have been. And they are such, as that
   their contrivance in the constitution of one and the same person, no
   created wisdom could reach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the infinite wisdom of God
   is most gloriously manifested in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   I. The first of these is, that he should have a nature provided for
   him, which originally was not his own. For in his divine nature, singly
   considered, he had no such relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them for whom he was to
   discharge his offices, as was necessary to communicate the benefit of
   them, nor could he discharge their principal duties. God could not die,
   nor rise again, nor be exalted to be a prince and a saviour, in his
   divine nature. Nor was there that special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> alliance between it and
   ours, as should give us a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> interest in what was done thereby.
				</p><p>
   It was mankind in whose behalf he was to exercise these offices. He was
   not to bear them with respect immediately to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the angels; and,
   therefore, he took not their nature on him. Ou gar depou angelon
   epilambanetai -- "He took not the nature of angels to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him;" (<reference osisRef="Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:16</reference>;) because he was not to be a mediator for them, a saviour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
   Those of them who had sinned were left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> everlasting ruin; and those
   who retained their original righteousness needed no redemption. But God
   prepared a body for him -- that is, a human nature: <reference osisRef="Heb.10.5">Hebrews 10:5</reference> The
   promise of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> -- viz., that he should be of the seed of the woman --
   was the foundation of the church; that is, he was made so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   church in and by that promise: <reference osisRef="Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</reference> In the accomplishment
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> he was "made of a woman," that so he might be "made under the
   law;" (<reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference>;) and "took upon him the seed of Abraham". For
   because the children were partakers of flesh and blood, "he also
   himself took part of the same:" <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference> For "in all things it
   behoved him to be made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his brethren, that he might be a
   merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God:" verse
   17. And this was absolutely necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the discharge of his
   offices, on the twofold account before mentioned. For --
				</p><p>
   (1.) Those acts of his offices, whereon the sanctification and
   salvation of the church do principally depend, could not be performed
   but in and by that nature. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> alone could he yield obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the law, that it might be fulfilled in us -- without which we could not
   stand in judgment before God. See <reference osisRef="Rom.8.3">Romans 8:3</reference>x. 3, 4. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> alone
   could he undergo the curse of the law, or be made a curse for us, that
   the blessing might come upon us: <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13 Gal.3.14">Galatians 3:13-14</reference> It was necessary
   that, as a priest, he should have something of his own to offer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, to make atonement for sin: <reference osisRef="Heb.8.3">Hebrews 8:3</reference> The like may be said of
   his whole ministry on the earth -- of all the effects of his
   incarnation.
				</p><p>
   (2.) In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> that cognation and alliance between him and the church,
   which were necessary to entitle it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a participation of the benefits
   of his mediation, do depend. For hereby he became our g�el -- the next
   of kin -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom belonged the right of redemptions and from whom
   alone we could claim relief and succour in our lost condition. This is
   divinely and at large declared by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.10 Heb.2.11 Heb.2.12 Heb.2.13 Heb.2.14 Heb.2.15 Heb.2.16 Heb.2.17 Heb.2.18">Hebrews 2:10-18</reference> Having
   at large explained this context in our exposition of that chapter, and
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> declared both the necessity and benefit of the cognation
   between the church and its High Priest, I shall not here farther insist
   upon it. See to the same purpose, <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25 Eph.5.26 Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:25-27</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, had he not
   been partaker of our nature, we could have received no benefit -- not
   that without which we must eternally perish -- by any office that he
   could have undertaken. This, therefore, was necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   constitution of his person, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his offices. But --
				</p><p>
   II. There was yet more required to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, or to render his offices
   effectual to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their proper ends. Not one of them could have been so,
   had he been no more than a man -- had he had no nature but ours. This I
   shall particularly demonstrate, considering them in their usual
   distribution -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of his divine person, and our own
   edification in believing.
				</p><p>
   (1.) He could not have been the great and singular prophet of the
   church, had he been a man only, though ever so excellent and glorious;
   and that for these three reasons: 
				</p><p>
   [1.] He was to be the prophet of the whole catholic church; that is, of
   all the elect of God, of all that shall be saved in all ages and
   places, from the beginning of the world to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. He had a
   personal ministry for the instruction of the church, whilst he was on
   the earth; but his prophetical office was not confined to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. For
   that was limited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one nation, <reference osisRef="Matt.15.24">Matthew 15:24</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.15.8">Romans 15:8</reference>, and was for
   a short season only. But the church was never without a prophet -- that
   is, one on whom it was incumbent to reveal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and instruct it in,
   the will of God -- nor can be so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consummation of all things.
   This is Christ alone. For --
				</p><p>
   1^st, I take it for granted that, from the beginning, from the giving
   of the first promise, the Son of God did, in a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner,
   undertake the care of the church -- as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the ends of the wisdom,
   will, and grace of God; and I take it for granted here, because I have
   proved it at large elsewhere. It evidently follows<note n="followeth">Auto-modernized</note> on the eternal
   compact between the Father and him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end. In the work which
   belonged to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> -- that which concerned its instruction in the will
   of God, its saving illumination and spiritual wisdom, is of such
   importance, as that, without it, none can be partaker of any other
   blessings whatever. In this instruction and illumination consists the
   discharge of the prophetical office of Christ.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, Upon the account of his susception of his office even before his
   incarnation, considered as God; he is said to act in it so as to be
   sent of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his work, <reference osisRef="Mic.5.2">Micah 5:2</reference>, "The Ruler of Israel, whose
   goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." His goings forth
   are not his eternal generation, which consists in one individual
   eternal act of the Father; but it is the egress, the exercise of his
   power and care for the church, that is so expressed. These were from
   the beginning the first foundation of the church, in answer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   everlasting counsels, <reference osisRef="Zech.2.8 Zech.2.9">Zechariah 2:8-9</reference>, "Thus says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord of hosts,
   After the glory has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he sent me to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the nations which spoiled you;"
   and "I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to
   their servants: and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent me."
   He who is sent calls<note n="calleth">Auto-modernized</note> himself "The Lord of hosts," and affirms that he
   will destroy the nations by the shaking of his hand; who can be no
   other but God himself. That is, it was the Son of God, who was to be
   incarnate, as is declared in the next words: "Sing and rejoice, O
   daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of
   thee, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord. And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in
   that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of
   thee; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent me to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   thee," verses 10, 11. He promises<note n="promiseth">Auto-modernized</note> that he will dwell in the midst of
   the people; which was accomplished when "the Word was made flesh, and
   dwelt among us," <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>; which was the time of the calling of the
   Gentiles, when many nations were to be joined to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord; and those
   that were so called were to be his people: "They shall be my people."
   And yet in all this he was sent by the Lord of hosts: "Thou shalt know
   that the Lord of hosts has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent me to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> thee." Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his susception of his offices towards the church, the Lord of
   hosts in the person of the Son is said to be sent by the Lord of hosts;
   that is, in the person of the Father. So was he the prophet of the
   church even before his incarnation, sent or designed by the Father to
   instruct it -- to communicate spiritual and saving light to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. So he
   testified concerning himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Jews, "Before Abraham was, I am,"
   <reference osisRef="John.8.58">John 8:58</reference> Which, as it invincibly proves his eternal pre-existence
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his incarnation, so it is not only intended. He was so before
   Abraham, as that the care of the church was then and always from the
   beginning on him. And he discharged this office four ways: 
				</p><p>
   (1^st,) By personal appearances in the likeness of human nature, in the
   shape of a man, as an indication of his future incarnation; and under
   those appearances instructing the church. So he appeared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Abraham,
   to Jacob, to Moses, to Joshua, as I have proved elsewhere. And those
   peculiar appearances of the person of the Son for the instruction of
   believers, are a full demonstration that the care and work of it were
   committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in a peculiar manner. And I am not without thoughts,
   although I see some difficulty in it, that the whole Old Testament,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God perpetually treats with men by an assumption of human
   affections to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, so to draw us with the cords of a man,
   proceeded from the person of the Son, in a preparation for, and
   prospect of, his future incarnation.
				</p><p>
   (2^dly,) By the ministry of angels upon his undertaking to be the
   mediator for the church with God, the angels were in a peculiar manner
   put into dependence on him, even as he became a new and immediate head
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole creation. This belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> glory which
   he had with the Father "before the world was," of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we have treated
   before. All things were to be anew gathered into a head in him, "both
   which are in heaven, and which are on earth," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference> And he became
   "the firstborn of every creature," <reference osisRef="Col.1.15">Colossians 1:15</reference>, the Lord and proprietor
   of them. Hence the whole ministry of angels was subordinate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him;
   and whatever instruction was thereby given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church in the mind
   and will of God, it was immediately from him, as the great prophet of
   the church.
				</p><p>
   (3^dly,) By sending his Holy Spirit to inspire, act, and guide the
   prophets, by whom God would reveal himself. God spoke to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them by the
   "mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began,"
   <reference osisRef="Luke.1.70">Luke 1:70</reference> But it was the Spirit of Christ that was in them that spoke
   by them, that revealed the things which concerned the redemption and
   salvation of the church, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11 1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:11-12</reference> And by this Spirit he
   himself preached to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those that were disobedient in the days of Noah,
   who are now in prison for their disobedience, <reference osisRef="1Pet.3.19 1Pet.3.20">1 Peter 3:19-20</reference> For
   he was so the prophet of the church always as to tender manifold
   instructions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the perishing, unbelieving world. Hence is he said to
   lighten "every man that comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note> into the world," <reference osisRef="John.1.9">John 1:9</reference>, by one way
   or other communicating to them some notices of God and his will; for
   his light shines<note n="shineth">Auto-modernized</note> in, or irradiates darkness itself -- that darkness
   which is come on the minds of men by sin -- though the "darkness
   comprehend it not," verse 5.
				</p><p>
   (4^thly,) By the ministry of holy men, acted and moved by his Spirit.
   So he gave forth the word that was written for an everlasting rule of
   faith and obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church.
				</p><p>
   Thus were the office and work of instructing and illuminating of the
   church on his hand alone from the beginning, and thus were they by him
   discharged. This was not a work for him who was no more but a man. His
   human nature had no existence until the fulness of time, the latter
   days, and therefore could effect or operate nothing before. And whereas
   the apostle distinguishes<note n="distinguisheth">Auto-modernized</note> between the speaking of God in the Son and
   his speaking in the prophets, opposing the one to the other, (<reference osisRef="Heb.1.1 Heb.1.2">Hebrews 1:1-2</reference>,) he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his personal ministry to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Church of the Jews, and not with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his being the peculiar
   fountain of life and light to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole church in all ages.
				</p><p>
   It is true, we have under the Gospel many unspeakable advantages from
   the prophetical office of Christ, above what they enjoyed under the Old
   Testament; but he was the prophet of the church equally in all ages.
   Only he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given out the knowledge of the mind of God in different
   degrees and measures; that which was most perfect being for many
   reasons reserved to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the times of the Gospel; the sum of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is, that
   God designed him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a pre-eminence above all in his own personal
   ministry.
				</p><p>
   If any shall now inquire how the Lord Christ could be the prophet of
   the church before he took our nature on him and dwelt among us; I shall
   also ask how they suppose him to be the prophet of the church now he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> left the world and is gone to heaven, so as that we neither see
   him nor hear him anymore? If they shall say that he is so by his
   Spirit, his Word, and the ministry which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordained; I say, so
   was he the prophet of the church before his incarnation also. To
   confine the offices of Christ, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their virtue, power and
   efficacy, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the times of the Gospel only, is utterly to evacuate the
   first promise, with the covenant of grace founded upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. And their
   minds are secretly influenced by a disbelief of his divine person, who
   suppose that the respect of the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, in faith, love,
   trust, and instruction, commences<note n="commenceth">Auto-modernized</note> from the date of his incarnation.
				</p><p>
   [2.] The full comprehension of the mind and will of God, of the whole
   divine counsel concerning his glory in the sanctification and salvation
   of the church, could not at once reside in the mind of any mere
   creature. Yet was this necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who was to be the prophet of
   the church; that is, the fountain of truth, life, and knowledge to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it. Hence is his name "Wonderful, Counsellor," as he who was
   participant of all the eternal counsels of God; whereon in him as
   incarnate all the treasures of divine wisdom and knowledge were hid,
   <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference> In him this could be alone, in whom was life, and "the life
   was the light of men," <reference osisRef="John.1.4">John 1:4</reference> God did reveal his mind and will by
   angels and men. But as he did it at sundry times, so he did it by
   several parts, or various parcels -- not only as the church was fit to
   receive it, but as they were able to communicate it. The whole of the
   divine counsels could not be comprehended, and so not declared, by any
   of them. Hence the angels themselves -- notwithstanding their residence
   in the presence of God, beholding his face, and all the glorious
   messages in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they were employed -- learned more of his mind after
   the personal ministry of Christ, and the revelation of the mysteries of
   his counsel in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, than ever they knew before, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.8 Eph.3.9">Ephesians 3:8-9</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.3.8 Eph.3.9 Eph.3.11">Ephesians 3:8-9, 11</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference> And on the account of their imperfection
   in the comprehension of his counsels, it is said that "he charged his
   angels with folly," <reference osisRef="Job.4.18">Job 4:18</reference> And the best of the prophets not only
   received divine truth by parcel, but comprehended not the depths of the
   revelations made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11 1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:11-12</reference>
				</p><p>
   To this purpose is that divine testimony, <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference>, "No man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen
   God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the
   Father, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> declared him." It is of all the prophets concerning
   whom it is affirmed, that no man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen God at any time. So is it
   evident in the antithesis between Moses the principal of them, and the
   Lord Christ, in the verse foregoing: "For the law was given by Moses,
   but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> no man, no other
   man or prophet whatever has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen God at any time; that is, had a
   perfect comprehension of his counsels, his mind and will, as they were
   to be declared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church. This is the privilege of the
   only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father; not only as being
   his eternal delight and love, but also as one acquainted with all his
   secret counsels -- as his fellow and participant of all his bosom
   thoughts.
				</p><p>
   He says that "all that ever came before him were thieves and robbers,
   but the sheep did not hear them," <reference osisRef="John.10.8">John 10:8</reference> This some of old impiously
   applied to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the prophets of the Old Testament; whereas he intended it
   only of those false prophets who pretended of themselves that they, any
   of them, were the Messiah, the great Shepherd of the sheep, whom his
   elect sheep would not attend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. But it is true that all who went
   before him, neither separately nor jointly, had the knowledge of God,
   so as to declare him fully to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church.
				</p><p>
   It is the most fond and wicked imagination of the Socinians, invented
   to countenance their disbelief and hatred of his divine person, that
   during the time of his flesh he was taken up into heaven, and there
   taught the doctrine of the Gospel, as Mohammed feigned concerning
   himself and his Alkoran. The reason and foundation of his perfect
   knowledge of God was, his being the only-begotten Son in the bosom of
   the Father, and not a fictitious rapture of his human nature.
				</p><p>
   To this purpose have we his own testimony, <reference osisRef="John.3.13">John 3:13</reference>, "And no man
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the
   Son of man which is in heaven." The matter of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he treats is the
   revelation of heavenly things. For, finding Nicodemus slow in the
   understanding of the doctrine and necessity of regeneration, which yet
   was plain and evident in comparison of some other heavenly mysteries,
   he asks of him, "If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe
   not," (things wrought in the earth and in your own breasts,) "how shall
   ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?" if I declare to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you the
   deep counsels of the will of God above, verse 12. But upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> a question
   might arise, how he should himself come to the knowledge of these
   heavenly things of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> they had never heard before, and which no other
   man could tell them of, especially considering what he had said before,
   verse 11, "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen."
   Of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> he gives an account in these words. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the ascending into
   heaven, which he denies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all men whatever -- "No man has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ascended
   up to heaven" -- is an entrance into all the divine, heavenly counsels
   of God; no man either has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> or ever had a full comprehension of these
   heavenly things but he himself alone. And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him it is ascribed on a
   double account: first, That he came down from heaven; secondly, That
   when he did so, he yet still continued in heaven: which two properties
   give us such a description of the person of Christ as declare him a
   full possessor of all the counsels of God. He descended from heaven in
   his incarnation, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he became the Son of man; and he is and was
   then in heaven in the essence and glory of his divine nature. This is
   the full of what we assert. In the knowledge and revelation of heavenly
   mysteries, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the calling, sanctification, and salvation of the
   church, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the prophetical office of Christ consist. This he
   positively affirms could not otherwise be, but that he who came down
   from heaven was also at the same instant in heaven. This is that
   glorious person of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak. He who, being always in heaven in the
   glory and essence of his divine nature, came down from heaven, not
   locally, by a mutation of his residence, but by dispensation in the
   assumption of our nature into personal union with himself -- he alone
   is meet and able to be the prophet of the church in the revelation of
   the heavenly mysteries of the counsels of the will of God. In him alone
   were "hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference>,
   because in him alone "dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily," verse
   9.
				</p><p>
   I do not hereby ascribe the infusion of omniscience, of infinite
   understanding, wisdom, and knowledge, into the human nature of Christ.
   It was and is a creature, finite and limited, nor is a capable subject
   of properties absolutely infinite and immense. Filled it was with light
   and wisdom to the utmost capacity of a creature; but it was so, not by
   being changed into a divine nature or essence, but by the communication
   of the Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it without measure. The Spirit of the Lord did rest
   upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel
   and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord, and
   made him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord, <reference osisRef="Isa.11.2 Isa.11.3">Isaiah 11:2-3</reference>
				</p><p>
   [3.] The Spirit of God dwelling in him, in all the fullness of his
   graces and gifts, gave him an understanding peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself; as
   above that of all creatures, so beneath the essential omniscience of
   the divine nature. Hence some things, as he was a man, he knew not,
   (<reference osisRef="Mark.13.32">Mark 13:32</reference>,) but as they were given him by revelation, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.1">Revelation of John 1:1</reference>
   But he is the prophet of the church in his whole entire person, and
   revealed the counsel of God, as he was in heaven in the bosom of the
   Father. Cursed be he that trusts<note n="trusteth">Auto-modernized</note> in man, that makes<note n="maketh">Auto-modernized</note> flesh his arm,
   as to the revelations of the counsels of God. Here lies the safety, the
   security, the glory of the church. How deplorable is the darkness of
   mankind, in their ignorance of God and heavenly things! In what ways of
   vanity and misery have the generality of them wandered ever since our
   first apostasy from God! Nothing but hell is more full of horror and
   confusion than the minds and ways of men destitute of heavenly light.
   How miserably did those among them who boasted themselves to be wise,
   wax foolish in their imaginations! How woefully did all their inquiries
   after the nature and will of God, their own state, duty, and happiness,
   issue in curiosity, uncertainty, vanity, and falsehood! He who is
   infinitely good and compassionate, did from the beginning give some
   relief in this woeful state, by such parcels of divine revelations as
   he thought meet to communicate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them by the prophets of old -- such
   as they were able to receive. By them he set up a light shining in a
   dark place, as the light of stars in the night. But it was the rising
   of the Sun of Righteousness alone that dispelled the darkness that was
   on the earth, the thick darkness that was on the people, bringing life
   and immortality to light by the Gospel. The divine person of the Son of
   God, in whom were hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, who is
   in the bosom of the Father, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> now made known all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   church, giving us the perfect idea and certainty of all sacred truth,
   and the full assurance of things invisible and eternal.
				</p><p>
   Three things are necessary, that we may have the benefit and comfort of
   divine light or truth -- 1^st, The fulness of its revelation; 2^dly,
   The infallibility of it; and, 3^dly, The authority from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   proceed. If either of these be wanting, we cannot attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> stability
   and assurance in the faith of it, or obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it.
				</p><p>
   1^st, Full it must be, to free us from all attempt of fear that any
   thing is detained or hidden from us that were needful for us to know.
   Without this the mind of man can never come to rest in the knowledge of
   truth. All that he knows may be useless to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, for the want of that
   which he neither does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> nor can know, because not revealed.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, And it must be infallible also. For this divine truth of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we
   treat, being concerning things unseen -- heavenly, eternal mysteries,
   transcending the reach of human reason -- nothing but the absolute
   infallibility of the revealer can bring the mind of man to assurance
   and acquiescency. And whereas the same truth enjoins to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us duties,
   many of them contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our inclinations and cross to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our several
   interests -- the great guides of corrupted nature -- the revelation of
   it must proceed from sovereign authority, that the will may comply with
   the mind in the embracement of it. All these are absolutely secured in
   the divine person of the great prophet of the church. His infinite
   wisdom, his infinite goodness, his essential veracity, his sovereign
   authority over all, give the highest assurance of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> a created
   understanding is capable, that nothing is detained from us -- that
   there is no possibility of error or mistake in what is declared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, nor any pretence left of declining obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the commands of
   the truth that we do receive. This gives the soul assured rest and
   peace in the belief of things which "eye has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not seen, nor ear heard,
   nor can enter into the heart of man to conceive." Upon the assurance of
   this truth alone can it with joy prefer things invisible and eternal
   above all present satisfactions and desires. In the persuasion of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   can it forego the best of present enjoyments, and undergo the worst of
   present evils; namely, in the experience of its present efficacy, and
   choice of that future recompense which it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> secure. And he believes
   not the Gospel to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own advantage, or the glory of God, whose faith
   rests not in the divine person of Jesus Christ, the great prophet of
   the church. And he who there finds rest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his soul, dares not admit
   of any copartners with him as to instruction in the mind of God.
				</p><p>
   3^dly, It was requisite to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the office of this great prophet of the
   church, and the discharge of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, that he should have power and
   authority to send the Holy Spirit to make his revelations of divine
   truth effectual to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the minds of men. For the church which he was to
   instruct, was not only in darkness, by reason of ignorance and want of
   objective light or divine revelations, but was incapacitated to receive
   spiritual things in a due manner when revealed. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it was the
   work of this prophet, not only to make known and declare the doctrines
   of truth, which are our external directive light, but also to irradiate
   and illuminate our minds, so that we might savingly apprehend them. And
   it is no wonder if those who are otherwise minded, who suppose
   themselves able to receive spiritual things, the things of God, in a
   due manner, upon their external proposal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, are regardless of
   the divine person of Christ as the prophet of the church. But upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note>
   they will never have experience of the life and power of the doctrine
   of the Gospel, if the apostle is to be believed, <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.9 1Cor.2.10 1Cor.2.11 1Cor.2.12">1 Corinthians 2:9-12</reference> Now,
   this internal illumination of the minds of men to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the acknowledgment
   of the truth can be wrought in them only by the Holy Spirit of God,
   <reference osisRef="Eph.1.17 Eph.1.18 Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:17-19</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> None, therefore, could be the prophet of
   the church, but he who had the power to send the Holy Spirit to enable
   it to receive his doctrine by the saving illumination of the minds of
   men. And this alone he could do, whose Spirit he is, proceeding from
   him; whom he therefore frequently promised so to send.
				</p><p>
   Without a respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these things, we cannot really be made partakers
   of the saving benefits and fruits of the prophetical office of Christ.
   And this we can have only in the exercise of faith on his divine
   person, which is the eternal spring from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> this office derives all
   life and efficacy.
				</p><p>
   The command of God, in respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as the prophet of the church,
   is, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him."
   Unless we actually regard him by faith as the only begotten Son of God,
   we can perform no duty aright in the hearing of him, nor shall we learn
   the truth as we ought. Hence it is that those who deny his divine
   person, though they pretend to attend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as the teacher of the
   church, do yet learn no truth from him, but embrace pernicious errors
   in the stead of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. So it is with the Socinians, and all that follow
   them. For whereas they scarcely own any other office of Christ but his
   prophetical -- looking on him as a man sent to teach the mind of God,
   and to confirm his doctrine by his sufferings, whereon he was afterward
   highly exalted of God -- they learn nothing from him in a due manner.
				</p><p>
   But this respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ is that which will
   ingenerate in us all those holy qualifications that are necessary to
   enable us to know the mind and will of God. For hence do reverence,
   humility, faith, delight, and assurance, arise and flow; without whose
   continual exercise, in vain shall men hope to learn the will of God by
   the utmost of their endeavours. And the want of these things is the
   cause of much of that lifeless, unsanctified knowledge of the doctrine
   of the Gospel which is amongst many. They learn not the truth from
   Christ, so as to expect all teachings from his divine power. Hence they
   never come to know it, either in its native beauty drawing the soul
   into the love and delight of what they know, or in its transforming
   efficacy changing the mind into its own image and likeness.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The same also is the state of things with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his kingly
   office and power. But this I have at large treated on elsewhere, and
   that much to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same purpose; namely, in the exposition of the 3d
   verse of the 1^st chapter of the Epistle to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Hebrews. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> I
   shall not here enlarge upon it.
				</p><p>
   Some seem to imagine, that the kingly power of Christ towards the
   church consists only in external rule by the Gospel and the laws
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, requiring obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the officers and rulers that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   appointed in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. It is true, that this also belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his kingly
   power and rule; but to suppose that it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> solely in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, is an
   ebullition from the poisonous fountain of the denial of his divine
   person. For if he be not God over all, whatever in words may be
   pretended or ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, he is capable of no other rule or
   power. But indeed no one act of his kingly office can be aright
   conceived or acknowledged, without a respect had to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his divine
   person. I shall instance only to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this purpose in two things in
   general.
				</p><p>
   [1.] The extent of his power and rule gives evidence to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. It is
   over the whole creation of God. "All power is given him in heaven and
   earth," <reference osisRef="Matt.28.18">Matthew 28:18</reference> "All things are put under his feet, he only
   excepted who put all things under him," <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.27">1 Corinthians 15:27</reference>; and he is made
   "head over all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.22">Ephesians 1:22</reference> Not only those who
   are above the rule of external law, as the holy angels; and those who
   have cast off all such rule, as the devils themselves; but all things
   that in their own nature are not capable of obedience to an external
   law or rule, as the whole inanimate creation, heaven, and earth, and
   the sea, with all things in them and under them, (<reference osisRef="Phil.2.10">Philippians 2:10</reference>,) with
   the dead bodies of men, which he shall raise at the last day.
				</p><p>
   For this power over the whole creation is not only a moral right to
   rule and govern it; but it is also accompanied with virtue, force, or
   almighty power, to act, order, and dispose of it at his pleasure. So is
   it described by the apostle from the Psalmist, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.10 Heb.1.11 Heb.1.12">Hebrews 1:10-12</reference>, "Thou,
   Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the
   heavens are the works of thine hands: they shall perish, but thou
   remainest; and they all shall wax old as does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> a garment; and as a
   vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou
   art the same, and thy years shall not fail." That power is required
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his kingly office through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he created all things in the beginning,
   and shall change them all, as a man folds up a vesture, in the end.
   Omnipotence, accompanied with eternity and immutability, are required
   to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   It is a vain imagination, to suppose that this power can reside in a
   mere creature, however glorified and exalted. All essential divine
   properties are concurrent with it, and inseparable from it. And where
   are the properties of God, there is the nature of God; for his being
   and his properties are one and the same.
				</p><p>
   If the Lord Christ, as king of the church, be only a mere man, and be
   as such only to be considered, however he may be exalted and glorified
   -- however he may be endowed with honour, dignity, and authority -- yet
   he cannot put forth or act any real physical power immediately and
   directly, but where he is present. But this is in heaven only; for the
   heaven must receive him "until the times of the restitution of all
   things," <reference osisRef="Acts.3.21">Acts 3:21</reference> And upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> his rule and power would be the
   greatest disadvantage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church that could befall it. For suppose
   it immediately under the rule of God, even the Father; his omnipotence
   and omnipresence, his omniscience and infinite wisdom -- through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he
   could be always present with every one of them, know all their wants,
   and give immediate relief according to the counsel of his will -- were
   a stable foundation for faith to rest upon, and an everlasting spring
   of consolation. But now, whereas all power, all judgment, all rule, is
   committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, and the Father does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> nothing towards the church
   but in and by him, if he have not the same divine power and properties
   with him, the foundation of the church's faith is cast down, and the
   spring of its consolation utterly stopped up.
				</p><p>
   I cannot believe in him as my heavenly king, who is not able by
   himself, and by the virtue of his presence with me, to make what
   changes and alterations he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note> in the minds of men, and in the
   whole creation of God, to relieve, preserve, and deliver me, and to
   raise my body at the last day.
				</p><p>
   To suppose that the Lord Christ, as the king and head of the church,
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not an infinite, divine power, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he is able always to
   relieve, succour, save, and deliver it -- if it were to be done by the
   alteration of the whole or any part of God's creation, so as that the
   fire should not burn, nor the water overwhelm them, nor men be able to
   retain their thoughts or ability one moment to afflict them; and that
   their distresses are not always effects of his wisdom, and never from
   the defect of his power -- is utterly to overthrow all faith, hope, and
   the whole of religion itself.
				</p><p>
   Ascribe therefore to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, in the exercise of his kingly
   office, only a moral power, operative by rules and laws, with the help
   of external instruments -- deprive him of omnipresence and omniscience,
   with infinite, divine power and virtue, to be acted at his pleasure in
   and over the whole creation -- and you rase the foundation of all
   Christian faith and hope to the ground.
				</p><p>
   There are no true believers who will part with their faith in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> for
   the whole world; namely, that the Lord Jesus Christ is able, by his
   divine power and presence, immediately to aid, assist, relieve, and
   deliver them in every moment of their surprisals, fears, and dangers,
   in every trial or duty they may be called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, in every difficulty
   they have to conflict withal. And to expect these things any otherwise
   but by virtue of his divine nature, is woefully to deceive our own
   souls. For this is the work of God.
				</p><p>
   [2.] The rule of Christ, as king of the church, is internal and
   spiritual, over the minds, souls, and consciences of all that do
   believe. There is no one gracious acting of soul in any one believer,
   at any time in the whole world, either in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sin or the
   performance of duty, but it is influenced and under the guidance of the
   kingly power of Christ. I suppose we have in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> not only the common
   faith, but also the common spiritual sense and experience, of them all.
   They know that in their spiritual life it is he that lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note> in them as
   the efficient cause of all its acts and that without him they can do
   nothing. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him they have respect in every the most secret and
   retired acting of grace, not only performed as under his eye, but by
   his assistance; on every occasion do they immediately, in the internal
   acting of their minds, look to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, as one more present with their
   souls than they are with themselves; and have no thoughts of the least
   distance of his knowledge or power. And two things are required hereto.
				</p><p>
   1^st, That he be kardiognostes -- that he have an actual inspection
   into all the frames, dispositions, thoughts, and internal actings, of
   all believers in the whole world, at all times, and every moment.
   Without this, he cannot bear that rule in their souls and consciences
   which we have described, nor can they act faith in him, as their
   occasions do require. No man can live by faith on Christ, no man can
   depend on his sovereign power, who is not persuaded that all the frames
   of his heart, all the secret groans and sighs of his spirit, all the
   inward labourings of his soul against sin, and after conformity to
   himself, are continually under his eye and cognizance. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> it is
   said, that all things are naked and opened to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his eyes, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.13">Hebrews 4:13</reference>
   And he says of himself, that he "searches<note n="searcheth">Auto-modernized</note>" (that is, knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note>) "the
   hearts and reins of men," <reference osisRef="Rev.2.23">Revelation of John 2:23</reference> And if these things are not the
   peculiar properties of the divine nature, I know nothing that may be so
   esteemed.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, There is required to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> an influence of power into all the
   acting of the souls of believers; -- all intimate, efficacious
   operation with them in every duty, and under every temptation. These
   all of them do look for, expect, and receive from him, as the king and
   head of the church. This also is an effect of divine and infinite
   power. And to deny these things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, is to rase the
   foundation of Christian religion. Neither faith in, nor love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him,
   nor dependence on him, nor obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his authority, can be
   preserved one moment, without a persuasion of his immediate intuition
   and inspection into the hearts, minds, and thoughts of all men, with a
   real influence into all the acting of the life of God in all them that
   believe. And the want of the faith of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is that which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> disjoined
   the minds of many from adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> produced a lifeless
   carcass of the Christian religion, instead of the saving power of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   (3.) The same may be said concerning his sacerdotal office, and all the
   acts of it. It was in and by the human nature that he offered himself a
   sacrifice for us. He had somewhat of his own to offer, <reference osisRef="Heb.8.3">Hebrews 8:3</reference>;
   and to this end a body was prepared for him, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.5">Hebrews 10:5</reference> But it was not
   the work of a man, by one offering, and that of himself, to expiate the
   sins of the whole church, and forever to perfect them that are
   sanctified, which he did, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.14">Hebrews 10:14</reference> God was to purchase his church
   "with his own blood," <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference> But this also I have spoken to at
   large elsewhere.
				</p><p>
   This is the sum of what we plead for: We can have no due consideration
   of the offices of Christ, can receive no benefit by them, nor perform
   any act of duty with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, or any of them, unless faith in
   his divine person be actually exercised as the foundation of the whole.
   For that is it from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> all their glory, power, and efficacy are derived.
   Whatever, therefore, we do with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his rule, whatever we
   receive by the communication of his Spirit and grace, whatever we learn
   from his Word by the teachings of his Spirit, whatever benefit we
   believe, expect, and receive, by his sacrifice and intercession on our
   behalf; our faith in them all, and concerning them all, is terminated
   on his divine person. The church is saved by his offices, because they
   are his. This is the substance of the testimony given concerning him,
   by God, even the Father, <reference osisRef="1John.5.10 1John.5.11">1 John 5:10-11</reference> "This is the record" that
   God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> testified concerning his Son, "that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given to us
   eternal life, and this life is in his Son." Eternal life is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, as it was wrought out and procured by the mediation of Christ on
   our behalf. But yet in him it was originally, and from him do we
   receive it in the discharge of his office; for this life is in the Son
   of God.
				</p><p>
   Hence it is that all those by whom the divine person of Christ is
   denied, are forced to give such a description of his offices, as that
   it is utterly impossible that the church should be saved by the
   discharge of them.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 8 The Faith of the Church under the Old Testament in and concerning the Person of Christ">
<title>Chapter 8 The Faith of the Church under the Old Testament in and concerning the Person of Christ.</title>
<p>   A brief view of the faith of the church under the Old Testament
   concerning the divine person of Christ, shall close these discourses,
   and make way for those that ensue, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our own duty with respect
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> shall be declared.
				</p><p>
   That the faith of all believers, from the foundation of the world, had
   a respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, I shall afterwards demonstrate; and to deny it, is
   to renounce both the Old Testament and the New. But that this faith of
   theirs did principally respect his person, is what shall here be
   declared. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> they knew was laid the foundation of the counsels of
   God for their deliverance, sanctification, and salvation. Otherwise it
   was but little they clearly understood of his office, or the way
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he would redeem the church.
				</p><p>
   The apostle Peter, in the confession he made of him, <reference osisRef="Matt.16.16">Matthew 16:16</reference>,
   exceeded the faith of the Old Testament in this, that he applied the
   promise concerning the Messiah to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that individual person: "Thou art
   the Christ, the Son of the living God" -- he that was to be the
   Redeemer and Saviour of the church. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> Peter then knew little of
   the way and manner through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he was principally so to be. And therefore,
   when he began to declare them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples -- namely, that they
   should be by his death and sufferings -- he in particular was not able
   to comply with it, but, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "Master, that be far from thee,"
   verse 22. As "flesh and blood" -- that is, his own reason and
   understanding -- did not reveal or declare Him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Peter to be the
   Christ, the Son of the living God, but the Father which is in heaven;
   so he stood in need of fresh assistance from the same almighty hand to
   believe that He should redeem and save his church by his death. And
   therefore he did refuse the external revelation and proposition of it,
   though made by Christ himself, until he received internal aid from
   above. And to suppose that we have faith now in Christ or his death on
   any other terms, is an evidence that we have no faith at all.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the faith of the saints under the Old Testament did
   principally respect the person of Christ -- both what it was, and what
   it was to be in the fulness of time, when he was to become the seed of
   the woman. What his special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> work was to be, and the mystery of the
   redemption of the church thereby, they referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own wisdom and
   grace; -- only, they believed that by him they should be saved from the
   hand of all their enemies, or all the evil that befell them on the
   account of the first sin and apostasy from God.
				</p><p>
   God gave them, indeed, representations and prefigurations of his office
   and work also. He did so by the high priest of the law, the tabernacle,
   with all the services and services to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> belonging. All that Moses
   did, as a faithful servant in the house of God, was but a "testimony of
   those things which were to be spoken after," <reference osisRef="Heb.3.5">Hebrews 3:5</reference> Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> the
   apostle tells us that all those things had but a "shadow of good things
   to come, and not the very image of the things themselves," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.1">Hebrews 10:1</reference>
   And although they are now to us full of light and instruction,
   evidently expressing the principal works of Christ's mediation, yet
   were they not so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. For the veil is now taken off from them in
   their accomplishment, and a declaration is made of the counsels of God
   in them by the Gospel. The meanest believer may now find out more of
   the work of Christ in the types of the Old Testament, than any prophets
   or wise men could have done of old. Therefore they always earnestly
   longed for their accomplishment -- that the day might break, and the
   shadows fly away by the rising of the Sun of Righteousness with healing
   in his wings. But as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person, they had glorious revelations
   concerning it; and their faith in him was the life of all their
   obedience.
				</p><p>
   The first promise, which established a new intercourse between God and
   man, was concerning his incarnation -- that he should be the seed of
   the woman, <reference osisRef="Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</reference>; that is, that the Son of God should be "made
   of a woman, made under the law," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference> From the giving of that
   promise the faith of the whole church was fixed on him whom God would
   send in our nature, to redeem and save them. Other way of acceptance
   with him there was none provided, none declared, but only by faith in
   this promise. The design of God in this promise -- which was to reveal
   and propose the only way which in his wisdom and grace he had prepared
   for the deliverance of mankind from the state of sin and apostasy
   into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> they were cast, with the nature of the faith and obedience of
   the church -- will not admit of any other way of salvation, but only
   faith in him who was thus promised to be a saviour. To suppose that men
   might fall off from faith in God by the revelation of himself in this
   promise, and yet be saved by attending to instructions given by the
   works of creation and providence, is an imagination that will no longer
   possess the minds of men than whilst they are ignorant of, or do
   forget, what it is to believe and to be saved.
				</p><p>
   The great promise made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Abraham was, that He should take his seed
   upon him, in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed, <reference osisRef="Gen.12.3">Genesis 12:3</reference>; xv. 18; xxii. 18; which promise is explained by the apostle,
   and applied to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.8">Galatians 3:8</reference> Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> "Abraham believed on the
   Lord, and it was counted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for righteousness," <reference osisRef="Gen.15.6">Genesis 15:6</reference>; for
   he saw the day of Christ, and rejoiced, <reference osisRef="John.8.56">John 8:56</reference>
				</p><p>
   The faith that Jacob instructed his sons in was -- that the Shiloh
   should come, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him should be the gathering of the nations, <reference osisRef="Gen.49.10">Genesis 49:10</reference> Job's faith was -- that his Redeemer was the Living One, and
   that he should stand on the earth in the latter day, <reference osisRef="Job.19.25">Job 19:25</reference>
				</p><p>
   The revelations made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> David principally concerned His person, and
   the glory of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. See Ps. ii., xlv., lxviii., lxviii., cx., cxviii.,
   especially Ps. xlv. and lxxii. compared, which give an account of their
   apprehensions concerning him.
				</p><p>
   The faith of Daniel was, that God would show mercy, for the Lord's
   sake, <reference osisRef="Dan.9.17">Daniel 9:17</reference>; and of all the prophets that the "Redeemer should
   come to Zion, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that turn from transgression in Jacob,"
   <reference osisRef="Isa.59.20">Isaiah 59:20</reference>
				</p><p>
   Of the same nature were all his personal appearances under the Old
   Testament, especially that most illustrious representation made of him
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the prophet Isaiah chap. vi., and the glorious revelation of his
   name, <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>
				</p><p>
   It is true that both these and other prophets had revelations
   concerning his sufferings also. For "the Spirit of Christ that was in
   them testified beforehand of his sufferings, and the glory that should
   follow," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11">1 Peter 1:11</reference>; -- an illustrious testimony to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> we have
   given us Ps. xxii., and Isa. liii. Nevertheless their conceptions
   concerning them were dark and obscure. It was his person that their
   faith principally regarded. Thence were they filled with desires and
   expectations of his coming, or his exhibition and appearance in the
   flesh. With the renewed promises of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> did God continually refresh the
   church in its straits and difficulties. And hereby did God call off the
   body of the people from trust in themselves, or boasting in their
   present privileges, which they were exceedingly prone to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   In process of time this faith, which wrought effectually in the Church
   of Israel, degenerated into a lifeless opinion, that proved the ruin of
   it. Whilst they really lived in the faith of him as the Saviour and
   Redeemer of the church from all its spiritual adversaries, as he who
   was to make "an end of sin, and bring in everlasting righteousness,"
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom all their present ordinances were subservient and directive;
   all grace, love, zeal, and patient waiting for the accomplishment of
   the promise, flourished among them. But in process of time, growing
   carnal, trusting in their own righteousness, and the privileges which
   they had by the law, their faith concerning the person of Christ
   degenerated into a corrupt, obstinate opinion, that he should be only a
   temporal king and deliverer; but as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> righteousness and salvation
   they were to trust to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves and the law. And this prejudicate
   opinion, being indeed a renunciation of all the grace of the promises
   of God, proved their utter ruin. For when he came in the flesh, after
   so many ages, filled up with continued expectations, they rejected and
   despised him as one that had neither form nor comeliness for which he
   should be desired. So does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it fall out in other churches. That which
   was faith truly spiritual and evangelical in their first planting,
   becomes a lifeless opinion in succeeding ages. The same truths are
   still professed, but that profession springs not from the same causes,
   nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it produce the same effects in the hearts and lives of men.
   Hence, in process of time, some churches continue to have an appearance
   of the same body which they were at first, but -- being examined -- are
   like a lifeless, breathless carcass, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the animating Spirit of
   grace does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not dwell. And then is any church, as it was with that of
   the Jews, nigh to destruction, when it corrupts formerly professed
   truths, to accommodate them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the present lusts and inclinations of
   men.

<title>Chapter 9 Honour due to the Person of Christ -- The Nature and Causes of it.</title>
<p>   Many other considerations of the same nature with those foregoing,
   relating to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory and honour of the person of Christ, may be
   taken from all the fundamental principles of religion. And our duty it
   is in them all, to "consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
   profession" -- "the Author and Finisher of our faith". I shall not
   insist on more, but proceed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those principles of truth which are
   immediately directive of our duty towards him; without diligent
   attendance to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, we do but in vain bear the name of Christians.
   And the substance of what is designed may be included in the following
   assertion: 
				</p><p>
     "The glory, life, and power of Christian religion, as Christian
     religion, and as seated in the souls of men, with all the acts and
     duties which properly belong to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, and are, therefore,
     peculiarly Christian, and all the benefits and privileges we receive
     by it, or by virtue of it, with the whole of the honour and glory
     that arise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God thereby, have all of them their formal nature
     and reason from their respect and relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of
     Christ; nor is he a Christian who is otherwise minded."
				</p><p>
   In the confirmation of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> it will appear what judgment ought to be
   passed on that inquiry -- which, after the uninterrupted profession of
   the catholic church for so many ages of a faith to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the contrary, is
   begun to be made by some amongst us -- namely, Of what use is the
   person of Christ in religion? For it proceeds on this supposition, and
   is determined accordingly -- that there is something in religion
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ is of no use at all; -- a vain
   imagination, and such as is destructive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole real intercourse
   between God and man, by the one and only Mediator!
				</p><p>
   The respect which we have in all acts of religion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of
   Christ may be reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these four heads: I. Honour. II. Obedience.
   III. Conformity. IV. The use we make of him, for the attaining and
   receiving of all Gospel privileges -- all grace and glory. And to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the whole of our religion, as it is Christian or evangelical, may be
   reduced.
				</p><p>
   I. The person of Christ is the object of divine honour and worship. The
   formal object and reason of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is the divine nature, and its essential
   infinite excellencies. For they are nothing but that respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Divine Being which is due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it from all rational creatures,
   regulated by revelation, and enforced by divine operations. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>
   the person of Christ is primarily the object of divine honour and
   worship, upon the account of his divine nature and excellencies. And
   those who, denying that nature in him, do yet pretend to worship him
   with divine and religious adoration, do but worship a golden calf of
   their own setting up; for a Christ who is not over all, God blessed
   forever, is not better. And it implies a contradiction, that any
   creature should, on any accounts be the immediate, proper object of
   divine worship; unless the divine essential excellencies be
   communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, or transfused into it, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it would cease to
   be a creature. For that worship is nothing but the ascription of divine
   excellencies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what is so worshipped.
				</p><p>
   But we now consider the Lord Christ in his whole entire person, the Son
   of God incarnate, "God manifest in the flesh." His infinite
   condescension, in the assumption of our nature, did no way divest him
   of his divine essential excellencies. For a time, they were shadowed
   and veiled thereby from the eyes of men; when "he made himself of no
   reputation, and took on him the form of a servant." But he eternally
   and unchangeably continued "in the form of God," and "thought it not
   robbery to be equal with God," <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7">Philippians 2:6-7</reference> He can no more really
   and essentially, by any act of condescension or humiliation, cease to
   be God, than God can cease to be. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, his being clothed with our
   nature derogates nothing from the true reason of divine worship due
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, but adds an effectual motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. He is, therefore, the
   immediate object of all duties of religion, internal and external; and
   in the dispensation of God towards us, none of them can be performed in
   a due manner without a respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   This, then, in the first place, is to be confirmed; namely, that all
   divine honour is due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son of God incarnate -- that is, the
   person of Christ.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="John.5.23">John 5:23</reference>: It is the will of the Father, "That all men should honour
   the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Son,
   honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Father which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent him." Some considerations on
   this divine testimony will confirm our position. It is of the Son
   incarnate that the words are spoken -- as all judgment was committed
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by the Father, as he was "sent" by him, verse 22 -- that is,
   of the whole person of Christ in the exercise of his mediatory office.
   And with respect to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> it is that the mind of God is peculiarly
   revealed. The way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God manifests<note n="manifesteth">Auto-modernized</note> his will, that all men should
   thus honour the Son, as they honour the Father, is by committing all
   power, authority, and judgment to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, verses 20-22, "For the Father
   loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, and shows<note n="showeth">Auto-modernized</note> him all things that himself does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note>: and he
   will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the
   Father raises<note n="raiseth">Auto-modernized</note> up the dead, and quickens<note n="quickeneth">Auto-modernized</note> them; even so the Son
   quickens<note n="quickeneth">Auto-modernized</note> whom he will. For the Father judges<note n="judgeth">Auto-modernized</note> no man, but has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   committed all judgment to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son." Not that these things are the
   formal reason and cause of the divine honour which is to be given him;
   but they are reasons of it, and motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, in that they are
   evidences of his being the Son of God.
				</p><p>
   But it may be said, What need is there that the Father should so
   interpose an act of his will and sovereign pleasure as to this
   honouring of the Son, seeing the sole cause and reason of this divine
   honour is the divine nature, which the Son is no less partaker of than
   the Father? I answer --
				</p><p>
   (1.) He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not in this command intend the honour and worship of
   Christ absolutely as God, but distinctly as the Son; which peculiar
   worship was not known under the Old Testament, but was now declared
   necessary in the committing all power, authority, and judgment to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him. This is the honour of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we speak.
				</p><p>
   (2.) He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it, lest any should conceive that "as he was now sent of
   the Father," and that in the "form of a servant," this honour should
   not be due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And the world was then far from thinking that it
   was so; and many, I fear, are yet of the same mind. He is, therefore,
   to be honoured by us, according to the will of God, kathos, "in like
   manner," as we honour the Father.
				</p><p>
   [1.] With the same honour; that is, divine, sacred, religious, and
   supreme. To honour the Father with other honour, is to dishonour him.
   When men design to give glory and honour to God which is not truly
   divine, it is idolatry; for this honour, in truth, is nothing but the
   ascription of all infinite, divine excellencies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Whereon, when
   men ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that which is not so, they fall into idolatry, by
   the worship of their own imaginations. So was it with the Israelites,
   when they thought to have given glory to God by making a golden calf,
   whereon they proclaimed a feast to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jehovah, <reference osisRef="Exod.32.5">Exodus 32:5</reference> And so
   was it with the heathen in all their images of God, and the glory which
   they designed to give him thereby, as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.23 Rom.1.24 Rom.1.25">Romans 1:23-25</reference> This is one kind of idolatry -- as the other is -- the ascribing
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> creatures anything that is proper and peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, any
   divine excellency. And we do not honour God the Father with one kind of
   honour, and the Son with another. That were not to honour the Son
   kathos, "as" we honour the Father, but in a way infinitely different
   from it.
				</p><p>
   [2.] In the same manner, with the same faith, love, reverence, and
   obedience, always, in all things, in all acts and duties of religion
   whatever.
				</p><p>
   This distinct honour is to be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of the Son by
   virtue of this command of the Father, though originally on the account
   of his oneness in nature with the Father. And our duty in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is
   pressed with the highest enforcement; he that honours not the Son,
   honours not the Father. He who denies<note n="denieth">Auto-modernized</note> the Son (in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>) "has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not the
   Father; [but he that acknowledges<note n="acknowledgeth">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the Father also,]" <reference osisRef="1John.2.23">1 John 2:23</reference> "And this is the record, that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given to us eternal
   life; and this life is in his Son. He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> life; and
   he that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not the Son of God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not life," <reference osisRef="1John.5.11 1John.5.12">1 John 5:11-12</reference> . If we
   are wanting in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, whatever we pretend, we do not worship nor honour
   God at all.
				</p><p>
   And there is reason to give this caution -- reason to fear that this
   great fundamental principle of our religion is, if not disbelieved, yet
   not much attended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in the world. Many, who profess a respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the Divine Being and the worship of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, seem to have little regard
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of the Son in all their religion; for although they may
   admit of a customary interposition of his name in their religious
   worship, yet the same distinct veneration of him as of the Father, they
   seem not to understand, or to be exercised in. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, all the
   acceptance of our persons and duties with God depends on this one
   conditions -- "That we honour the Son, even as we honour the Father."
   To honour the Son as we ought to honour the Father, is that which makes
   us Christians, and which nothing else will so do.
				</p><p>
   This honour of the person of Christ may be considered -- in the duties
   of it, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist; and in the principle, life, or spring,
   of those duties.
				</p><p>
   The duties through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we ascribe and express divine honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ may
   be reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> two heads, 1^st, Adoration; 2^dly, Invocation.
				</p><p>
   1^st, Adoration is the prostration of soul before him as God, in the
   acknowledgment of his divine excellencies and the ascription of them
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. It is expressed in the Old Testament by hshtchvh; that is,
   humbly to bow down ourselves or our souls to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. The LXX. render it
   constantly by proskuneo; which is the word used in the New Testament
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same purpose. The Latins expressed it usually by adoro . And
   these words, though of other derivations, are of the same signification
   with that in the Hebrew; and they do all of them include some external
   sign of inward reverence, or a readiness to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. Hence is that
   expression, "He bowed down his head and worshipped," [<reference osisRef="Gen.24.26">Genesis 24:26</reference>;]
   see [also] <reference osisRef="Ps.95.6">Psalms 95:6</reference> And these external signs are of two sorts
   (1^st,) Such as are natural and occasional; (2^dly,) Such as are
   solemn, stated, or instituted. Of the first sort are the lifting up of
   our eyes and hands towards heaven upon our thoughts of him, and
   sometimes the casting down of our whole persons before him; which deep
   thoughts with reverence will produce. Outward instituted signs of this
   internal adoration are all the ordinances of evangelical worship. In
   and by them do we solemnly profess and express our inward veneration of
   him. Other ways may be invented to the same purpose, but the Scripture
   knows them not, yea, condemns them. Such are the veneration and
   adoration of the pretended images of him, and of the Host, as they call
   it, among the Papists.
				</p><p>
   This adoration is due continually to the person of Christ, and that --
   as in the exercise of the office of mediation. It is due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him from
   the whole rational creation of God. So is it given in charge to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   angels above. For when he brought the First-begotten into the world, he
   said, Proskunesatosan autoo pantes angeloi Theou; that is, hshtchvvlv
   kl'lhym, "Worship him, all ye gods," <reference osisRef="Ps.97.7">Psalms 97:7</reference> "Let all the angels
   of God worship him," adore him, bow down before him, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.6">Hebrews 1:6</reference> See our
   exposition of that place; -- the design of the whole chapter being to
   express the divine honour that is due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, with
   the grounds of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. This is the command given also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church,
   "He is thy Lord, and worship thou him," <reference osisRef="Ps.45.11">Psalms 45:11</reference>
				</p><p>
   A glorious representation of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> -- whether in the church above, or in
   that militant here on the earth -- is given us, <reference osisRef="Rev.5.6 Rev.5.7 Rev.5.8 Rev.5.9 Rev.5.10 Rev.5.11 Rev.5.12 Rev.5.13 Rev.5.14">Revelation of John 5:6-14</reference>, "And I
   beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and
   in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having
   seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent
   forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the
   right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the
   book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the
   Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours,
   which are the prayers of saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou
   art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>: for thou
   wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every
   kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld,
   and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the
   beasts, and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times
   ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice,
   Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and
   wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every
   creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and
   such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
   Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note>
   upon the throne, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb, for ever and ever. And the four
   beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and
   worshipped him that lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note> for ever and ever."
				</p><p>
   The special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> object of divine adoration, the motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and the
   nature of it, or what it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in, are here declared.
				</p><p>
   The object of it is Christ, not separately, but distinctly from the
   Father, and jointly with him. And he is proposed, 1^st, As having
   fulfilled the work of his mediation in his incarnation and oblation --
   as a Lamb slain. 2^dly, In his glorious exaltation -- "in the midst of
   the throne of God." The principal thing that the heathen of old
   observed concerning the Christian religion, was, that in it "praises
   were sung to Christ as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God."
				</p><p>
   The motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this adoration are the unspeakable benefits which we
   receive by his mediation, "Thou art worthy, for thou wast slain, and
   hast redeemed us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God," etc..
				</p><p>
   Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> the same glory, the same honour, is ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God the Father: "Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note> upon the throne, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb, for ever and
   ever."
				</p><p>
   The nature of this adoration is described to consist in three things.
   1^st, Solemn prostration: "And the four living creatures said, Amen.
   And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note>
   for ever and ever." So also is it described, <reference osisRef="Rev.4.10 Rev.4.11">Revelation of John 4:10-11</reference> 2^dly,
   In the ascription of all divine honour and glory, as is at large
   expressed, <reference osisRef="Rev.5.11 Rev.5.12 Rev.5.13">Revelation of John 5:11-13</reference> 3^dly, In the way of expressing the design
   of their souls in this adoration, which is by the praises: "They sung a
   new song" -- that is, of praise; for so are all those psalms which have
   that title of a new song. And in these things -- namely, solemn
   prostration of soul in the acknowledgment of divine excellencies,
   ascriptions of glory and honour with praise -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> religious adoration
   consist. And they belong not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the great holy society of them who
   worship above and here below -- whose hearts are not always ready to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   this solemn adoration of the Lamb, and who are not on all occasions
   exercised in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   And this adoration of Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> differ from the adoration of God,
   absolutely considered, and of God as the Father, not in its nature, but
   merely on the account of its special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> motives. The principal motive
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the adoration of God, absolutely considered, is the work of
   creation -- the manifestation of his glory in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> -- with all the
   effects of his power and goodness upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> ensuing. So it is declared,
   <reference osisRef="Rev.4.11">Revelation of John 4:11</reference>, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour,
   and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they
   are and were created." And the principal motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the adoration and
   worship of God as the Father, is that eternal love, grace, and
   goodness, which he is the fountain of in a peculiar manner, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.4 Eph.1.5">Ephesians 1:4-5</reference> But the great motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the adoration of Christ is the work of
   redemption, <reference osisRef="Rev.5.12">Revelation of John 5:12</reference>, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
   power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
   blessing." The reason of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is given, verses 9, 10, , "For thou wast
   slain, and hast redeemed us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by thy blood; and made us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   God kings and priests." The adoration is the same, verse 13, "Blessing,
   and honour, and glory, and power, be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note> upon the
   throne, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb, for ever and ever." But the immediate
   motives of it are different, as its objects are distinct.
				</p><p>
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> no small part of the life of the Christian religion does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   consist. The humbling of our souls before the Lord Christ, from an
   apprehension of his divine excellencies -- the ascription of glory,
   honour, praise, with thanksgiving to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, on the great motive of the
   work of redemption with the blessed effects of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> -- are things
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the life of faith is continually exercised; nor can we have any
   evidence of an interest in that blessedness which consists in the
   eternal assignation of all glory and praise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in heaven, if we
   are not exercised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this worship of him here on earth.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, Invocation is the second general branch of divine honour -- of
   that honour which is due and paid to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father.
   This is the first exercise of divine faith -- the breath of the
   spiritual life. And it consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in two things, or has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> two parts.
   (1^st,) An ascription of all divine properties and excellencies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him whom we invocate. This is essential to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> prayer, which without it
   is but vain babbling. Whoever comes to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God hereby, "must believe that
   he is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
   (2^dly,) There is in it also a representation of our wills, affections,
   and desires of our souls, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him on whom we call, with an expectation
   of being heard and relieved, by virtue of his infinitely divine
   excellencies. This is the proper acting of faith with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   ourselves; and hereby it is our duty to give honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of
   Christ.
				</p><p>
   When he himself died in the flesh, he committed his departing soul by
   solemn invocation into the hands of his Father, <reference osisRef="Ps.31.5">Psalms 31:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Luke.23.46">Luke 23:46</reference>, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit." And to evidence
   that it is the will of God that we should honour the Son, as we honour
   the Father, even as the Son himself in his human nature, who is our
   example, honoured the Father -- he who first died in the faith of the
   Gospel, bequeathed his departing soul into the hands of Jesus Christ by
   solemn invocation, <reference osisRef="Acts.7.59">Acts 7:59</reference>, "They stoned Stephen, epikaloumenon,
   solemnly invocating, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." And
   having by faith and prayer left his own soul safe in the hands of the
   Lord Jesus, he adds one petition more to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he died:
   "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge," verse 60. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> did he give
   divine honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ in the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> invocation of his name, in
   the highest instances that can be conceived. In his first request,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he committed his departing soul into his hands, he ascribed
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him divine omniscience, omnipresence, love, and power; and in the
   latter, for his enemies, divine authority and mercy, to be exercised in
   the pardon of sin. In his example is the rule established for the
   special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> invocation of Christ for the effects of divine power and
   mercy.
				</p><p>
   Hence the apostle describes<note n="describeth">Auto-modernized</note> the church, or believers, and
   distinguishes<note n="distinguisheth">Auto-modernized</note> it, or them, from all others, by the charge of this
   duty, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.2">1 Corinthians 1:2</reference>, "With all that call on the name of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, both their Lord and ours." To call on the name of the Lord
   Jesus expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> solemn invocation in the way of religious worship. The
   Jews did call on the name of God. All others in their way called on the
   names of their gods. This is that through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the church is distinguished
   from them all -- it calls on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   He requires that, as we believe on God, that is, the Father, so we
   should believe on him also; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> honour the Son, as we honour
   the Father, <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference> The nature of this faith, and the manner how
   it is exercised on Christ, we shall declare afterwards. But the
   apostle, treating of the nature and efficacy of this invocation,
   affirms, that we cannot call on him in whom we have not believed, <reference osisRef="Rom.10.14">Romans 10:14</reference> From where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it follows, on the contrary, that he on whom we are bound
   to believe, on him it is our duty to call. So the whole Scripture is
   closed with a prayer of the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, expressing
   their faith in him: "Even so, come, Lord Jesus," <reference osisRef="Rev.22.20">Revelation of John 22:20</reference>
				</p><p>
   There is not any one reason of prayer -- not any one motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it --
   not any consideration of its use or efficacy -- but renders this
   peculiar invocation of Christ a necessary duty. Two things in general
   are required to render the duty of invocation lawful and useful. First,
   That it have a proper object. Secondly, That it have prevalent motives
   and encouragements to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. These in concurrence are the formal reason
   and ground of all religious worship in general, and of prayer in
   particular. So are they laid down as the foundation of all religion,
   <reference osisRef="Exod.20.2 Exod.20.3">Exodus 20:2-3</reference>, "I am the Lord thy God" -- that is, the proper object
   of all religious worship -- "which brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt, out of the house of bondage;" which being summarily and
   typically representative of all divine benefits, temporal, spiritual,
   and eternal, is the great motive to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. The want of both these in
   all mere creatures, saints and angels, makes the invocation of them,
   not only useless, but idolatrous. But they both eminently concur in the
   person of Christ, and his acting towards us. All the perfections of the
   divine nature are in him; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is the proper object of religious
   invocation. On this account when he acted in and towards the church as
   the great angel of the covenant, God instructed the people to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all
   religious observance of him, and obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, <reference osisRef="Exod.23.21">Exodus 23:21</reference>,
   "Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not
   pardon your transgressions; for my name is in him." Because the name of
   God was in him -- that is, the divine nature, with sovereign authority
   to punish or pardon sin -- therefore was all religious obedience due
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And no motives are wanting to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. All that the Lord Christ
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done for us, and all the principles of love, grace, compassion,
   and power, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> so done did proceed, are all of
   this nature; and they are accompanied with the encouragement of his
   relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and charge concerning us. Take away this duty, and
   the peculiar advantage of the Christian religion is destroyed.
				</p><p>
   We have lived to see the utmost extremes that the Christian religion
   can divert into. Some, with all earnestness, do press the formal
   invocation of saints and angels as our duty; and some will not grant
   that it is lawful for us so to call on Christ himself.
				</p><p>
   The Socinians grant generally that it is lawful for us to call on
   Christ; but they deny that it is our duty at any time so to do. But as
   they own that it is not our duty, so on their principles it cannot be
   lawful. Denying his divine person, they leave him not the proper object
   of prayer. For prayer without an ascription of divine excellencies --
   as omniscience, omnipresence, and almighty power -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him whom we
   invocate, is but vain babbling, that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> nothing of the nature of true
   prayer in it; and to make such ascriptions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who by nature is
   not God, is idolatrous.
				</p><p>
   The solemn ordinary worship of the church, and so of private believers
   in their families and closets, is under a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> directory and
   guidance. For the person of the Father -- as the eternal fountain of
   power, grace, and mercy -- is the formal object of our prayers, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   whom our supplications are directed. The divine nature, also lately
   considered, is the object of natural worship and invocation; but it is
   the same divine nature, in the person of the Father, that is the proper
   object of evangelical worship and invocation. So our Saviour has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   taught us to call on God under the name and notion of a father, <reference osisRef="Matt.6.9">Matthew 6:9</reference>; that is, his God and our God, his Father and our Father, <reference osisRef="John.20.17">John 20:17</reference> And this invocation is to be by and in the name of the Son,
   Jesus Christ, through the aid of the Holy Ghost. He is in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   considered as the mediator between God and man -- as the Holy Ghost is
   he by whom supplies of grace, enabling us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the acceptable
   performance of our duties are actually communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. This is
   the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God will be glorified. This is the mystery of our
   religion, that we worship God according to the economy of his wisdom
   and grace, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> dispense of himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, in the persons
   of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Otherwise he will not be honoured or
   worshipped by us. And those who in their worship or invocation do
   attempt an approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine nature as absolutely considered,
   without respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the dispensation of God in the distinct persons of
   the holy Trinity, do reject the mystery of the Gospel, and all the
   benefit of it. So is it with many. And not a few, who pretend a great
   devotion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, do supply other things into the room of Christ, as
   saints and angels -- rejecting also the aids of the Spirit to comply
   with imaginations of their own, whose as distance in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> they more
   approve of.
				</p><p>
   But this is the nature and method of ordinary solemn evangelical
   invocation. So it is declared, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference>, "Through him we have access
   by one Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father." It is the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom we have our
   access, whom we peculiarly invocate; as it is expressed, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.14 Eph.3.15 Eph.3.16">Ephesians 3:14-16</reference>, "For this cause I bow my knees to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he
   would grant you," etc.. But it is through him -- that is, by Christ in
   the exercise of his mediatory office -- that we have this access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the Father; we ask in his name, and for his sake, <reference osisRef="John.14.13 John.14.14">John 14:13-14</reference>;
   xvi. 23, 24. They did so of old, though not in that express exercise of
   faith which we now attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. <reference osisRef="Dan.9.17">Daniel 9:17</reference>, "Hear, O Lord, and have
   mercy, for the Lord's sake." All this are we enabled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> by one Spirit
   -- through the aids and assistance of the Spirit of grace and
   supplication, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.26 Rom.8.27">Romans 8:26-27</reference> So that prayer is our crying -- "Abba,
   Father," by the Spirit of the Son, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.6">Galatians 4:6</reference> This is farther
   declared, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.15 Heb.4.16">Hebrews 4:15-16</reference>; x. 19-22. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is the Lord Christ
   considered, not absolutely with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his divine person, but
   with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his office, that through "him our faith and hope
   might be in God," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.21">1 Peter 1:21</reference>
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it being our duty, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been proved, to invocate the name
   of Christ in a particular manner, and this being the ordinary solemn
   way of the worship of the church -- we may consider on what occasions,
   and in what seasons, this peculiar invocation of Christ, who in his
   divine person is both our God and our advocate, is necessary for us,
   and most acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   (1^st,) Times of great distresses in conscience through temptations and
   desertions, are seasons requiring an application to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ by
   special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> invocation. Persons in such conditions, when their souls, as
   the Psalmist speaks, are overwhelmed in them, are continually
   solicitous about compassion and deliverance. Some relief, some
   refreshment, they often find in pity and compassion from them who
   either have been in the same condition themselves, or by Scripture
   light do know the terror of the Lord in these things. When their
   complaints are despised, and their troubles ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> other causes
   than what they are really sensible of, and feel within themselves -- as
   is commonly done by physicians of no value -- it is an aggravation of
   their distress and sorrow. And they greatly value every sincere
   endeavour for relief, either by counsel or prayer. In this state and
   condition the Lord Christ in the Gospel is proposed as full of tender
   compassion -- as he alone who is able to relieve them. In that himself
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> suffered, being tempted, he is touched with a feeling of our
   infirmities, and knows how to have compassion on them that are out of
   the way, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.18">Hebrews 2:18</reference>; iv. 15; v. 2. So is he also, as he alone who is
   able to succour, to relieve, and to deliver them. "He is able to
   succour them that are tempted," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.18">Hebrews 2:18</reference> Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> are they drawn,
   constrained, encouraged to make applications to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by prayer, that
   he would deal with them according to his compassion and power. This is
   a season rendering the discharge of this duty necessary. And hereby
   have innumerable souls found consolation, refreshment, and deliverance.
   A time of trouble is a time of the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> exercise of faith in
   Christ. So himself gives direction, <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>, "Let not your heart be
   troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me." Distinct acting of
   faith on Christ are the great means of support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note> and relief in
   trouble. And it is by special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> invocation, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they put forth and
   exert themselves.
				</p><p>
   An instance of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> temptation, and the distress with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> it
   is attended, we have in the apostle Paul. He had "a thorn in the
   flesh," "a messenger of Satan to buffet" him. Both expressions declare
   the deep sense he had of his temptation, and the perplexity with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>
   it was accompanied. "For this cause he besought the Lord thrice, that
   it might depart from him," <reference osisRef="2Cor.12.7 2Cor.12.8">2 Corinthians 12:7-8</reference> He applied himself
   solemnly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> prayer for its removal, and that frequently. And it was
   the Lord -- that is, the Lord Jesus Christ -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom he made his
   application. For so the name Lord is to be interpreted -- if there be
   nothing contrary in the context -- as the name of God is of the Father,
   by virtue of that rule, <reference osisRef="1Cor.8.6">1 Corinthians 8:6</reference>, "To us there is one God, the
   Father; and one Lord Jesus Christ." And it is evident also in the
   context. The answer he received to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his prayer was, "My grace is
   sufficient for thee; for my power [strength] is made perfect in
   weakness". And whose power that was, who gave him that answer, he
   declares in the next words, "Most gladly therefore will I glory in my
   infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me," that is, the
   power of him on whom he called, who gave him that answer, "My power is
   made perfect in weakness."
				</p><p>
   (2^dly,) Times of gracious discoveries either of the glory of Christ in
   himself, or of his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, are seasons that call for this duty.
   The glory of Christ in his person and offices is always the same, and
   the revelation that is made of it in the Scripture varies not; but --
   as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our perception and apprehension of it, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> our hearts and
   minds are affected with it in a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner -- there are apparent
   seasons of it which no believers are unacquainted withal. Sometimes
   such a sense of it is attained under the dispensation of the Word;
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> as Christ on the one hand is set forth evidently crucified
   before our eyes, so on the other he is gloriously exalted. Sometimes it
   is so in prayer, in meditation, in contemplation on him. As an ability
   was given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the bodily sight of Stephen, to see, upon the opening of
   the heavens, "the glory of God, and Jesus standing at his right hand,"
   <reference osisRef="Acts.7.55 Acts.7.56">Acts 7:55-56</reference> -- so he opens the veil sometimes, and gives a clear,
   affecting discovery of his glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the minds and souls of believers;
   and in such seasons are they drawn forth and excited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> invocation
   and praise. So Thomas -- being surprised with an apprehension and
   evidence of his divine glory and power after his resurrection, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   he was declared to be the Son of God with power, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.4">Romans 1:4</reference> -- cried
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, "My Lord and my God," <reference osisRef="John.20.28">John 20:28</reference> There was in his words
   both a profession of his own faith and a solemn invocation of Christ.
   When, therefore, we have real discoveries of the glory of Christ, we
   cannot but speak to him, or of him. "These things said Isaiah, when he
   saw his glory, and spake of him," <reference osisRef="John.12.41">John 12:41</reference> And Stephen, upon a
   view of it in the midst of his enraged enemies, testified immediately,
   "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right
   hand of God." And thereby was he prepared for that solemn invocation of
   his name which he used presently after, "Lord Jesus, receive my
   spirit," <reference osisRef="Acts.7.56 Acts.7.59">Acts 7:56, 59</reference> And so, also, upon his appearance as the
   Lamb, to open the book of prophecies; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there was an eminent
   manifestation of his glory -- seeing none else could be found in
   heaven, or earth, or under the earth, that was able to open the book,
   or so much as to look upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Rev.5.3">Revelation of John 5:3</reference> "The four and twenty elders
   fell down before him," and presenting all the prayers of the saints,
   "sang a new song" of praise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, verses 8-10 . This is our duty,
   this will be our wisdom, upon affecting discoveries of the glory of
   Christ; namely, to apply ourselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by invocation or praise;
   and thereby will the refreshment and advantage of them abide upon our
   minds.
				</p><p>
   So is it also as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his love. The love of Christ is always the same
   and equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> there are peculiar seasons of the
   manifestation and application of a sense of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of
   believers. So it is when it is witnessed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, or shed abroad in
   their hearts by the Holy Ghost. Then is it accompanied with a
   constraining power, to oblige us to live to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who died for use and
   rose again, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.14 2Cor.5.15">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</reference> And of our spiritual life to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ,
   invocation of him is no small portion and this sense of his love we
   might enjoy more frequently than for the most part we do, were we not
   so much wanting to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> ourselves and our own concerns. For although it be
   an act of sovereign grace in God to grant it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and affect us
   with it, as it seems good to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, yet is our duty required to dispose
   our hearts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its reception. Were we diligent in casting out all that
   "filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness" which corrupts our
   affections, and disposes the mind to abound in vain imaginations; were
   our hearts more taken off from the love of the world, which is
   exclusive of a sense of divine love; did we more meditate on Christ and
   his glory; -- we should more frequently enjoy these constraining visits
   of his love than now we do. So himself expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> it, <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference>,
   "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and
   open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
   with me." He makes intimation of his love and kindness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. But
   ofttimes we neither hear his voice when he speaks, nor do open our
   hearts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. So do we lose that gracious, refreshing sense of his
   love, which he expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> in that promise, "I will sup with him, and he
   shall sup with me." No tongue can express that heavenly communion and
   blessed intercourse which is intimated in this promise. The expression
   is metaphorical, but the grace expressed is real, and more valued than
   the whole world by all that have experience of it. This sense of the
   love of Christ and the effect of it in communion with him, by prayer
   and praises, is divinely set forth in the Book of Canticles. The church
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is represented as the spouse of Christ; and, as a faithful
   spouse, she is always either solicitous about his love, or rejoicing in
   it. And when she has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> attained a sense of it, she abounds<note n="aboundeth">Auto-modernized</note> in
   invocation admiration and praise. So does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the church of the New
   Testament, upon an apprehension of his love, and the unspeakable fruits
   of it: "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own
   blood, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made us kings and priests to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God and his Father; to
   him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen," <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5 Rev.1.6">Revelation of John 1:5-6</reference> This,
   therefore, is another season that calls for this duty.
				</p><p>
   (3^dly;) Times of persecution for his Name's sake, and for the
   profession of the gospel, are another season rendering this peculiar
   invocation of Christ both comely and necessary. Two things will befall
   the minds of believers in such a season; -- [1^st,] that their thoughts
   will be neatly exercised about him, and conversant with him. They
   cannot but continually think and meditate on him for whom they suffer.
   None ever suffered persecution on just grounds, with sincere ends, and
   in a due manner, but it was so with them. The invincible reasons they
   have to suffer for him -- taken from his person love, grace, and
   authority -- from what he is in himself, what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done for them,
   and what account of all things is to be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- do
   continually present themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their minds. Wildernesses, prisons,
   and dungeons, have been filled with thoughts of Christ and his love.
   And many in former and latter ages have given an account of their
   communion and holy intercourse with the Lord Christ under their
   restraints and sufferings. And those who at any time have made an
   entrance into such a condition, will all of them give in the testimony
   of their own experience in this matter. [2^dly,] Such persons have deep
   and fixed apprehensions of the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> which the Lord
   Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in them as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their present condition -- as also of his
   power to support them, or to work out their deliverance. They know and
   consider -- that "in all their afflictions he is afflicted" -- suffers
   in all their sufferings -- is persecuted in all their persecutions;
   that in them all he is full of love, pity, and unspeakable compassion
   towards them; that his grace is sufficient for them -- that his power
   shall be perfected in their weakness, to carry them through all their
   sufferings, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his and their own glory. In these circumstances, it is
   impossible for them who are under the conduct of his Spirit, not to
   make special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> applications continually to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for those aids of grace
   -- for those pledges of love and mercy -- for those supplies of
   consolation and spiritual refreshments, which their condition calls
   for. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, in this state, the invocation of Christ is the refuge
   and sheet-anchor of the souls of them who truly believe in him. So it
   was to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the holy martyrs of old, and in latter ages.
				</p><p>
   This doctrine and duty is not for them who are at ease. The afflicted,
   the tempted, the persecuted, the spiritually disconsolate, will prize
   it, and be found in the practice of it. And all those holy souls who,
   in most ages, on the account of the profession of the gospel, have been
   reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> outwardly unbelievable distresses, have, as was said, left
   their testimony to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this duty, and the benefits of it. The refreshment
   which they found in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> was a sufficient balance against the weight of
   all outward calamities, enabling them to rejoice under them with "joy
   unspeakable and full of glory." This is the church's reserve against
   all the trials it may be exercised withal, and all the dangers
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> it is exposed. Whilst believers have liberty of access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him in their supplications, who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> all power in his hand, who is full
   of ineffable love and compassion towards them, especially as suffering
   for his sake -- they are more than conquerors in all their
   tribulations.
				</p><p>
   (4^thly,) When we have a due apprehension of the eminent acting of any
   grace in Christ Jesus, and withal a deep and abiding sense of our own
   want of the same grace, it is a season of special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> application to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   by prayer for the increase of it. All graces as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their habit were
   equal in Christ -- they were all in him in the highest degree of
   perfection; and every one of them did he exercise in its due manner and
   measure on all just occasions. But outward causes and circumstances
   gave opportunity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the exercise of some of them in a way more
   eminent and conspicuous than others were exercised in. For instance; --
   such were his unspeakable condescension, self-denial, and patience in
   sufferings; which the apostle to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this purpose insists upon, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5 Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:5-8</reference> Now the great design of all believers is to be like Jesus Christ,
   in all grace, and all the exercise of it. He is in all things their
   pattern and example. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, when they have a view of the glory of
   any grace as it was exercised in Christ, and withal a sense of their
   own defect and want in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> -- conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him being their design
   -- they cannot but apply themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in solemn invocation, for
   a farther communication of that grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, from his stores and
   fulness. And these things mutually promote one another in us, if duly
   attended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. A due sense of our own defect in any grace will farther
   us in the prospect of the glory of that grace in Christ. And a view, a
   due contemplation, of the glorious exercise of any grace in him, will
   give us light to discover our own great defect in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, and want
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. Under a sense of both, an immediate application to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ by
   prayer would be all unspeakable furtherance of our growth in grace and
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Nor can there be any more effectual way or means
   to draw supplies of grace from him, to draw water from the wells of
   salvation. When, in a holy admiration of, and fervent love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, any
   grace as eminently exercised in and by him, with a sense of our own
   want of the same grace, we ask it of him in faith -- he will not deny
   it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. So the disciples, upon the prescription of a difficult
   duty, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whose due performance a good measure of faith was required
   -- out of a sense of the all-fulness of him, and their own defect in
   that grace which was necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the peculiar duty there prescribed
   -- immediately pray to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, saying, "Lord, increase our faith," <reference osisRef="Luke.17.5">Luke 17:5</reference> The same is the case with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any temptation that may
   befall us, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he was exercised, and over which he prevailed.
				</p><p>
   (5^thly,) The time of death, whether natural, or violent for his sake,
   is a season of the same nature. So Stephen recommended his departing
   soul into his hands with solemn prayer. "Lord Jesus," said he, "receive
   my spirit." To the same purpose have been the prayers of many of his
   faithful martyrs in the flames, and under the sword. In the same manner
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the faith of innumerable holy souls work in the midst of their
   deathbed groans. And the more we have been in the exercise of faith on
   him in our lives, the more ready will it be in the approaches of death,
   to make its resort to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in a peculiar manner.
				</p><p>
   And it may be other instances of an alike nature may be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   same purpose.
				</p><p>
   An answer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> an inquiry which may possibly arise from what we have
   insisted on, shall close this discourse. For whereas the Lord Jesus
   Christ, as Mediator, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> intercede with the Father for us, it may be
   inquired, Whether we may pray to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, that he would so intercede on
   our behalf; whether this be comprised in the duty of invocation or
   prayer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him?
				</p><p>
   Ans. 1. There is no precedent nor example of any such thing, of any
   such prayer, in the Scripture; and it is not safe for us to venture on
   duties not exemplified in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. Nor can any instance of a necessary
   duty be given, of whose performance we have not an example in the
   Scripture. 2. In the invocation of Christ, we "honour the Son, even as
   we honour the Father." Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> his divine person is in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   formal object of our faith. We consider him not in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> as acting in
   his mediatory office towards God for us, but as he who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the
   absolute power and disposal of all the good things we pray for. And in
   our invocation of him, our faith is fixed on, and terminated on his
   person. But -- as he is in the discharge of his mediatory office --
   through him "our faith and hope are in God," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.21">1 Peter 1:21</reference> He who is
   the Mediator, or Jesus Christ the Mediator -- as God and man in one
   person -- is the object of all divine honour and worship. His person,
   and both his natures in that person, is so the object of religious
   worship. This is that which we are in the proof and demonstration of.
   Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> it is his divine nature, and not his discharge of the office of
   mediation, that is the formal reason and object of divine worship. For
   it consists in an ascription of infinitely divine excellencies and
   properties to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him whom we so worship. And to do this on any account
   but of the divine nature, is in itself a contradiction, and in them
   that do it idolatry. Had the Son of God never been incarnate, he had
   been the object of all divine worship. And could there have been a
   mediator between God and us who was not God also, he could never have
   been the object of any divine worship or invocation. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> Christ
   the Mediator, God and man in one person, is in all things to be
   honoured, even as we honour the Father; but it is as he is God, equal
   with the Father, and not as Mediator -- in which respect he is inferior
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. With respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his divine person, we ask immediately of
   himself in our supplications, -- as he is Mediator -- we ask of the
   Father in his name. The different actings of faith on him, under the
   same distinction shall be declared in the next chapter.

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 10 The Principle of the Assignation of Divine Honour to the Person of Christ in both the Branches of it which is Faith in Him">
<title>Chapter 10 The Principle of the Assignation of Divine Honour to the Person of Christ, in both the Branches of it; which is Faith in Him.</title>
<p>   The principle and spring of this assignation of divine honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ, in both the branches of it, is faith in him. And this has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   the foundation of all acceptable religion in the world since the
   entrance of sin. There are some who deny that faith in Christ was
   required from the beginning, or was necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the worship of God,
   or the justification and salvation of them that did obey him. For,
   whereas it must be granted that "without faith it is impossible to
   please God," which the apostle proves by instances from the foundation
   of the world, Heb. xi. -- they suppose it is faith in God under the
   general notion of it, without any respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, that is
   intended. It is not my design to contend with any, nor expressly to
   confute such ungrateful opinions -- such pernicious errors. Such this
   is, which -- being pursued in its proper tendency -- strikes at the
   very foundation of Christian religion; for it at once deprives us of
   all contribution of light and truth from the Old Testament. Somewhat I
   have spoken before of the faith of the saints of old concerning him. I
   shall now, therefore, only confirm the truth, by some principles which
   are fundamental in the faith of the Gospel.
				</p><p>
   1. The first promise, <reference osisRef="Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</reference> -- truly called Proteuangelion --
   was revealed, proposed, and given, as containing and expressing the
   only means of delivery from that apostasy from God, with all the
   effects of it, under which our first parents and all their posterity
   were cast by sin. The destruction of Satan and his work in his
   introduction of the state of sin, by a Saviour and Deliverer, was
   prepared and provided for in it. This is the very foundation of the
   faith of the church; and if it be denied, nothing of the economy or
   dispensation of God towards it from the beginning can be understood.
   The whole doctrine and story of the Old Testament must be rejected as
   useless, and no foundation be left in the truth of God for the
   introduction of the New.
				</p><p>
   2. It was the person of Christ, his incarnation and mediation, that
   were promised under the name of the "seed of the woman," and the work
   he should do in breaking the head of the serpent, with the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   he should do it in suffering, by his power. The accomplishment of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   was in God's sending his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the
   fulness of time, made under the law, or by his manifestation in the
   flesh, to destroy the works of the devil. So is this promise
   interpreted, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference>; iv. 4; <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.15 Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:14-16</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.3.8">1 John 3:8</reference> This
   cannot be denied but upon one of these two grounds: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) That nothing is intended in that divine revelation but only a
   natural enmity that is between mankind and serpents. But this is so
   foolish an imagination, that the Jews themselves, who constantly refer
   this place to the Messiah, are not guilty of. All the whole truth
   concerning God's displeasure on the sin of our first parents, with what
   concerns<note n="concerneth">Auto-modernized</note> the nature and consequence of that sin, is everted hereby.
   And whereas the foundation of all God's future dealing with them and
   their posterity is plainly expressed in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, it is turned into that
   which is ludicrous, and of very little concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in human life. For
   such is the enmity between mankind and serpents -- which not one in a
   million knows any thing of or is troubled with. This is but to lay the
   axe of atheism to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all religion built on divine revelation. Besides,
   on this supposition, there is in the words not the least intimation of
   any relief that God tendered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our parents for their delivery from
   the state and condition into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> they had cast themselves by their sin
   and apostasy. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> they must be esteemed to be left absolutely
   under the curse, as the angels were that fell -- which is to root all
   religion out of the world. For amongst them who are absolutely under
   the curse, without any remedy, there can be no more than is in hell. Or
   --
				</p><p>
   (2.) It must be, because some other way of deliverance and salvation,
   and not that by Christ, is here proposed and promised. But, whereas
   they were to be wrought by the "seed of the woman" -- if this were not
   that Christ in whom we do believe, there was another promised, and he
   is to be rejected. And this is fairly at once to blot out the whole
   Scripture as a fable; for there is not a line of doctrinal truth in it
   but what depends on the traduction of Christ from this first promise.
				</p><p>
   3. This promise was confirmed, and the way of the deliverance of the
   church by virtue of it declared, in the institution of expiatory
   sacrifices. God in them and by them declared from the beginning, that
   "without shedding of blood there was no remission;" that atonement for
   sin was to be made by substitution and satisfaction. With respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them, the Lord Christ was called "The Lamb of God," even as he took
   away the sins of the world by the sacrifice of himself, <reference osisRef="John.1.29">John 1:29</reference> For
   we "were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
   without blemish and without spot," <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.19">1 Peter 1:19</reference> In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy
   Spirit refers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the institution and nature of sacrifices from the
   beginning. And he is thence represented in heaven as a "Lamb that had
   been slain," <reference osisRef="Rev.5.6">Revelation of John 5:6</reference> -- the glory of heaven arising from the fruits
   and effects of his sacrifice. And because of the representation of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   in all the former sacrifices, is he said to be a "Lamb slain from the
   foundation of the world," <reference osisRef="Rev.13.8">Revelation of John 13:8</reference> And it is strange to me that
   any who deny not the expiatory sacrifice of Christ, should doubt
   whether the original of these sacrifices were of divine institution or
   the invention of men. And it is so, amongst others, for the reasons
   ensuing: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) On the supposition that they were of men's finding out and
   voluntary observation, without any previous divine revelation, it must
   be granted that the foundation of all acceptable religion in the world
   was laid in, and resolved into, the wisdom and wills of men, and not
   into the wisdom, authority, and will of God. For that the great
   solemnity of religion, which was as the centre and testimony of all its
   other duties, did consist in these sacrifices even before the giving of
   the law, will not be denied. And in the giving of the law, God did not,
   on this supposition, confirm and establish his own institutions with
   additions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them of the same kind, but set his seal and approbation
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the inventions of men. But this is contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> natural light,
   and the whole current of Scripture revelations.
				</p><p>
   (2.) All expiatory sacrifices were, from the beginning, types and
   representations of the sacrifice of Christ; whereon all their use,
   efficacy, and benefit among men -- all their acceptance with God -- did
   depend. Remove this consideration from them, and they were as
   irrational a service, as unbecoming the divine nature, as any thing
   that reasonable creatures could fix upon. They are to this day as
   reasonable a service as ever they were, but that only their respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the sacrifice of Christ is taken from them. And what person of any
   ordinary understanding could now suppose them a meet service through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> to
   glorify the divine nature? Besides, all expiatory sacrifices were of
   the same nature, and of the same use, both before and after the giving
   of the law. But that all those afterwards were typical of the sacrifice
   of Christ, the apostle demonstrates at large in his Epistle to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Hebrews. The inquiry, therefore, is, whether this blessed prefiguration
   of the Lord Christ and his sacrifice, as he was the Lamb of God taking
   away the sin of the world, was an effect of the wisdom, goodness, and
   will of God, or of the wills and inventions of men. And let it be
   considered, also, that these men, who are supposed to be the authors of
   this wonderful representation of the Lord Christ and his sacrifice, did
   indeed know little of them -- or, as the assertors of this opinion
   imagine, nothing at all. To suppose that those who knew no more of
   Christ than they could learn from the first promise -- which, as some
   think, was nothing at all -- should of their own heads find out and
   appoint this divine service, which consisted only in the prefiguration
   of him and his sacrifice; and that God should not only approve of it,
   but allow it as the principal means for the establishment and exercise
   of the faith of all believers for four thousand years; is to indulge
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> thoughts deviating from all rules of sobriety. He that sees not a
   divine wisdom in this institution, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> scarce seriously exercised his
   thoughts about it. But I have elsewhere considered the causes and
   original of these sacrifices, and shall not therefore farther insist
   upon them.
				</p><p>
   4. Our first parents and all their holy posterity did believe this
   promise, or did embrace it as the only way and means of their
   deliverance from the curse and state of sin; and were upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> justified
   before God. I confess we have not infallible assurance of any who did
   so in particular, but those who are mentioned by name in Scripture, as
   Abel, Enoch, Noah, and some others; but to question it concerning
   others also, as of our first parents themselves, is foolish and
   impious. This is done by the Socinians to promote another design,
   namely, that none were justified before God on the belief of the first
   promise, but on their walking according to the light of nature, and
   their obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> some special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> revelations about temporal things --
   the vanity of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been before discovered. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, our first
   parents and their posterity did so believe the first promise, or they
   must be supposed either to have been kept under the curse, or else to
   have had, and to make use of, some other way of deliverance from it. To
   imagine the first is impious -- for the apostle affirms that they had
   this testimony, that they pleased God, <reference osisRef="Heb.11.5">Hebrews 11:5</reference>; which under the
   curse none can do -- for that is God's displeasure. And in the same
   place he confirms their faith, and justification upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, with a "cloud
   of witnesses," <reference osisRef="Heb.12.1">Hebrews 12:1</reference> To affirm the latter is groundless; and it
   includes a supposal of the relinquishing<note n="relinquishment">Auto-modernized</note> of the wisdom, grace, and
   authority of God in that divine revelation, for men to betake
   themselves to none knows what. For that there was in this promise the
   way expressed which God in his wisdom and grace had provided for their
   deliverance, we have proved before. To forsake this way, and to betake
   themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any other, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he had made no mention or revelation
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, was to reject his authority and grace.
				</p><p>
   As for those who are otherwise minded, it is incumbent on them directly
   to prove these three things: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) That there is another way -- that there are other means for the
   justification and salvation of sinners -- than that revealed, declared,
   and proposed in that first promise. And when this is done, they must
   show to what end -- on that supposition -- the promise itself was
   given, seeing the end of it is evacuated.
				</p><p>
   (2.) That upon a supposition that God had revealed in the promise the
   way and means of our deliverance from the cures and state of sin, it
   was lawful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men to forsake it, and to betake themselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   another way, without any supernatural revelation for their guidance.
   For if it was not, their relinquishing<note n="relinquishment">Auto-modernized</note> of the promise was no less
   apostasy from God in the revelation of himself in a way of grace, than
   the first sin was as to the revelation of himself in the works of
   nature: only, the one revelation was by inbred principles, the other by
   external declaration; nor could it otherwise be. Or, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) That there was some other way of the participation of the benefit
   of this promise, besides faith in it, or in him who was promised
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; seeing the apostle has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> declared that no promise will profit
   them by whom it is not mixed with faith, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.2">Hebrews 4:2</reference> Unless these
   things are plainly proved -- which they will never be -- whatever men
   declaim about universal objective grace in the documents of nature, it
   is but a vain imagination.
				</p><p>
   5. The declaration of this promise, before the giving of the law, with
   the nature and ends of it, as also the use of sacrifices, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it
   was confirmed, was committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ordinary ministry of our first
   parents and their godly posterity, and the extraordinary ministry of
   the prophets which God raised up among them. For God spake of our
   redemption by Christ by the mouth of his holy prophets from the
   beginning of the world, <reference osisRef="Luke.1.70">Luke 1:70</reference> No greater duty could be incumbent
   on them, by the light of nature and the express revelation of the will
   of God, than that they should, in their several capacities, communicate
   the knowledge of this promise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all in whom they were concerned. To
   suppose that our first parents, who received this promise, and those
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom they first declared it, looking on it as the only foundation
   of their acceptance with God and deliverance from the curse, were
   negligent in the declaration and preaching of it, is to render them
   brutish, and guilty of a second apostasy from God. And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this
   principle -- which is founded in the light of nature -- there is
   countenance given by revelation also. For Enoch did prophesy of the
   things which were to accompany the accomplishment of this promise, <reference osisRef="Jude.1.14">Jude 14</reference>; and Noah was a preacher of the righteousness to be brought in by
   it, <reference osisRef="2Pet.2.5">2 Peter 2:5</reference> -- as he was an heir of the righteousness which is by
   faith, in himself, <reference osisRef="Heb.11.7">Hebrews 11:7</reference>
				</p><p>
   6. All the promises that God gave afterwards to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church under the
   Old Testament, before and after giving the law -- all the covenants
   that he entered into with particular persons, or the whole congregation
   of believers -- were all of them declarations and confirmations of the
   first promise, or the way of salvation by the mediation of his Son,
   becoming the seed of the woman, to break the head of the serpent, and
   to work out the deliverance of mankind. As most of these promises were
   expressly concerning him, so all of them in the counsel of God were
   confirmed in him, <reference osisRef="2Cor.1.20">2 Corinthians 1:20</reference> And as there are depths in the
   Scripture of the Old Testament concerning him which we cannot fathom,
   and things innumerable spoken of him or in his person which we conceive
   not, so the principal design of the whole is the declaration of him and
   his grace. And it is unprofitable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them who are otherwise minded.
   Sundry promises concerning temporal things were, on various occasions,
   superadded to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this great spiritual promise of life and grace. And the
   enemies of the person and mediation of Christ do contend that men are
   justified by their faith and obedience with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those
   particular revelations, which were only concerning temporal things. But
   to suppose that all those revelations and promises were not built upon
   and resolved into, did not include in them, the grace and mercy of this
   first promise -- is to make them curses instead of blessings, and
   deprivations of that grace which was infinitely better than what, on
   this supposition, was contained in them. The truth is, they were all
   additions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and confirmations of it; nor had any thing of
   spiritual good in them, but upon a supposition of it. In some of them
   there was an ampliation of grace in the more full declaration of the
   nature of this promise, as well as an application to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their persons
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom they were made. Such was the promise made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Abraham, which
   had a direct respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, as the apostle proves<note n="proveth">Auto-modernized</note>, Gal. iii. and
   iv.
				</p><p>
   7. Those who voluntarily, through the contempt of God and divine grace,
   fell off from the knowledge and faith of this promise, whether at once
   and by choice, or gradually through the love of sin, were in no better
   condition than those have been, or would be, who have so fallen off or
   should so apostatize from Christian religion after its revelation and
   profession. And although this proved, in process of time, both before
   and after the flood, to be the condition of the generality of mankind,
   yet is it in vain to seek after the means of salvation among them who
   had voluntarily rejected the only way which God had revealed and
   provided for that end. God upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> "suffered all nations to walk in
   their own ways," <reference osisRef="Acts.14.16">Acts 14:16</reference> -- "winking at the times of their
   ignorance" -- not calling them to repentance, <reference osisRef="Acts.17.30">Acts 17:30</reference>; yea, he
   "gave them up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their own hearts lust, and they walked in their own
   counsels," <reference osisRef="Ps.81.12">Psalms 81:12</reference> And nothing can be more derogatory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   wisdom and holiness of God, than to imagine that he would grant other
   ways of salvation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them who had rejected that only one which he had
   provided; which was by faith in Christ, as revealed in that first
   promise.
				</p><p>
   8. From these considerations, which are all of them unquestionable
   principles of truth, two things are evident.
				</p><p>
   (1.) That there was no way of the justification and salvation of
   sinners revealed and proposed from the foundation of the world, but
   only by Jesus Christ, as declared in the first promise.
				</p><p>
   (2.) That there was no way for the participation of the benefits of
   that promise, or of his work of mediation, but by faith in him as so
   promised. There was, therefore, faith in him required from the
   foundation of the world; that is, from the entrance of sin. And how
   this faith respected his person has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been before declared. Now, faith
   in him as promised for the works and ends of his mediation, and faith
   in him as actually exhibited and as having accomplished his work, are
   essentially the same, and differ only with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the economy of
   times, which God disposed at his pleasure. Hence the efficacy of his
   mediation was the same to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them who then so believed, as it is now
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us after his actual exhibition in the flesh.
				</p><p>
   But yet it is acknowledged, that -- as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the clearness and fulness
   of the revelation of the mystery of the wisdom and grace of God in him
   -- as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the constitution of his person in his incarnation, and
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> the determination of the individual person promised from the
   beginning, through the actual accomplishment of the work which he was
   promised for -- faith in him, as the foundation of that divine honour
   which it is our duty to give to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, is far more evidently and
   manifestly revealed and required in the Gospel, or under the New
   Testament, than it was under the Old. See <reference osisRef="Eph.3.8 Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10 Eph.3.11">Ephesians 3:8-11</reference> The respect
   of faith now to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ is that which renders it truly evangelical. To
   believe in him, to believe on his name, is that signal special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> duty
   which is now required of us.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the ground of the actual assignation of divine honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the person of Christ, in both branches of it, adoration and invocation,
   is faith in him. So he said to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the blind man whose eyes he opened,
   "Believest thou on the Son of God?" <reference osisRef="John.9.35">John 9:35</reference> And he said, "Lord, I
   believe; and he worshipped him," verse 38. All divine worship or
   adoration is a consequent effect and fruit of faith. So also is
   invocation; for "How shall they call on him in whom they have not
   believed?" <reference osisRef="Rom.10.14">Romans 10:14</reference> Him in whom we believe, we ought to adore and
   invocate. For these are the principal ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> divine faith does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   act itself. And so to adore or invocate any in whom we ought not to
   believe, is idolatry.
				</p><p>
   This faith, therefore, on the person of Christ is our duty; yea, such a
   duty it is, as that our eternal condition does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> more peculiarly depend
   on the performance or nonperformance of it than on any other duty
   whatever. For constantly under those terms is it prescribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
   "He that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> on the Son has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> everlasting life: and he that
   believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note>
   on him," <reference osisRef="John.3.36">John 3:36</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the nature and exercise of this faith
   must be inquired into.
				</p><p>
   There is a faith which is exercised towards those by whom the mind and
   will of God is revealed. So it is said of the Israelites, "They
   believed the Lord and Moses," <reference osisRef="Exod.14.31">Exodus 14:31</reference>; that is, that he was sent
   of God, was no deceiver -- that it was the word and will of God which
   he revealed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. So <reference osisRef="2Chr.20.20">2 Chronicles 20:20</reference>, "Believe in the Lord your
   God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye
   prosper." It was not the persons of the prophets, but their message,
   that was the object of the faith required. It was to believe what they
   said, as from God -- not to believe in them as if they were God. So it
   is explained by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Acts.26.27">Acts 26:27</reference>, "King Agrippa, believest
   thou the prophets? I know that thou believest." He believed that they
   were sent of God, and that the word they spake was from him; otherwise
   there was no believing of them who were dead so many ages before.
				</p><p>
   And this is all the faith in Christ himself which some will allow. To
   believe in Christ, they say, is only to believe the doctrine of the
   Gospel revealed by him. Hence they deny that any could believe in him
   before his coming into the world, and the declaration of the mind of
   God in the Gospel made by him. An assent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the truth of the Gospel,
   as revealed by Christ, is with them the whole of that faith in Christ
   Jesus which is required of us.
				</p><p>
   Of all that poison which at this day is diffused in the minds of men,
   corrupting them from the mystery of the Gospel, there is no part that
   is more pernicious than this one perverse imagination, that to believe
   in Christ is nothing at all but to believe the doctrine of the Gospel;
   which yet, we grant, is included in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. For as it allows the
   consideration of no office in him but that of a prophet, and that not
   as vested and exercised in his divine person, so it utterly overthrows
   the whole foundation of the relation of the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and
   salvation by him.
				</p><p>
   That which suits my present design, is to evince that it is the person
   of Christ which is the first and principal object of that faith
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> we are required to believe in him; and that so to do, is not
   only to assent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the truth of the doctrine revealed by him, but also
   to place our trust and confidence in him for mercy, relief, and
   protection -- for righteousness, life, and salvation -- for a blessed
   resurrection and eternal reward. This I shall first manifest from some
   few of those multiplied testimonies in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this truth is declared, and
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it is confirmed as also with some arguments taken from them;
   and then proceed to declare the ground, nature, and exercise of this
   faith itself.
				</p><p>
   As to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the testimonies confirming this truth, it must be observed of
   them all in general, that wherever faith is required towards our Lord
   Jesus Christ, it is still called believing "in him," or "on his name,"
   according as faith in God absolutely is every where expressed. If no
   more be intended but only the belief of the doctrine revealed by him,
   then whose doctrine soever we are obliged to believe, we may be rightly
   said to believe in them, or to believe on their name. For instance, we
   are obliged to believe the doctrine of Paul the apostle, the
   revelations made by him, and that on the hazard of our eternal welfare
   by the unbelieving of them; yet that we should be said to believe in
   Paul, is that which he did utterly detest, <reference osisRef="1Cor.1.13 1Cor.1.15">1 Corinthians 1:13, 15</reference>
				</p><p>
   For the places themselves the reader may consult, among others <reference osisRef="John.1.12">John 1:12</reference>; iii. 16, 18, 36; vi. 29, 35, 41; vii. 38, 39; <reference osisRef="Acts.14.23">Acts 14:23</reference>; xvi.
   31; xix. 4; xxiv. 24; xxvi. 18; <reference osisRef="Rom.3.26">Romans 3:26</reference>; ix. 33; x. 11 <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.6">1 Peter 2:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.5.1 1John.5.10">1 John 5:1, 10</reference> <reference osisRef="John.5.10 John.5.13">John 5:10, 13</reference> There is not one of these but
   sufficiently confirms the truth. Some few others not named may be
   briefly insisted on.
				</p><p>
   <reference osisRef="John.14.1">John 14:1</reference>, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me." The distinction
   made between God and him limits the name of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of the
   Father. Faith is required in them both, and that distinctly: "Ye
   believe in God, believe also in me." And it is the same faith, of the
   same kind, to be exercised in the same way and manner, that is
   required; as is plain in the words. They will not admit of a double
   faith, of one faith in God, and of another in Christ, or of a distinct
   way of their exercise.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as faith divine is fixed on, and terminated in, the person
   of the Father; so is it likewise distinctly in and on the person of the
   Son: and it was to evidence his divine nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them -- which is the
   ground and reason of their faith -- that he gave his command to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   disciples. This he farther testifies, verses 9-11. And as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   exercise of this faith, it respected the relief of their souls, under
   troubles, fears, and disconsolations: "Let not your heart be troubled:
   ye believe in God, believe also in me." To believe in him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   relief of our souls against troubles, is not to assent merely to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   doctrine of the Gospel, but also to place our trust and confidence in
   him, for such supplies of grace, for such an exercise of the acts of
   divine power, as through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we may be supported and delivered. And we have
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the whole of what we plead. Divine faith acted distinctly in,
   and terminated on, the person of Christ -- and that with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   supplies of grace and mercy from him in a way of divine power.
				</p><p>
   So he speaks to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Martha, <reference osisRef="John.11.25 John.11.26 John.11.27">John 11:25-27</reference>, "He that believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> in me,
   though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever lives<note n="liveth">Auto-modernized</note>, and
   believes<note n="believeth">Auto-modernized</note> in me, shall never die. Believest thou this?" To which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> she
   answers "Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of
   God." His person was the object of her faith; and her belief in him
   comprised a trust for all spiritual and eternal mercies.
				</p><p>
   I shall add one more, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> not only the thing itself, but the
   special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> ground and reason of it, is declared, <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference> -- "The life
   which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
   who loved me, and gave himself for me." That faith he asserts which is
   the cause of our spiritual life -- that life to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God which we lead in
   the flesh, or whilst we are in the body, not yet admitted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> sight
   and enjoyment. Of this faith the Son of God is both the author and the
   object; the latter of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is here principally intended. And this is
   evident from the reason and motive of it, which are expressed. This
   faith I live by, am in the continual exercise of, because he "loved me,
   and gave himself for me." For this is that which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> powerfully
   influence our hearts to fix our faith in him and on him. And that
   person who so loved us is the same in whom we do believe. If his person
   was the seat of his own love, it is the object of our faith And this
   faith is not only our duty, but our life. He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it not, is dead
   in the sight of God.
				</p><p>
   But I hope it is not yet necessary to multiply testimonies to prove it
   our duty to believe in Jesus Christ -- that is, to believe in the
   person of the Son of God, for other faith in Christ there is none; yet
   I shall add one or two considerations in the confirmation of it.
				</p><p>
   1^st, There is no more necessary to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> -- namely, to prove the
   person of Christ the Son of God to be the proper and distinct object of
   faith divine -- than what we have already demonstrated concerning the
   solemn invocation of him. For, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle, "How they call on him
   in whom they have not believed?" <reference osisRef="Rom.10.14">Romans 10:14</reference> It holds on either side.
   We cannot, we ought not, to call on him in whom we do not, we ought not
   to believe. And in whom we do believe, on him we ought to call.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, if it be our duty to call on the name of Christ, it is our
   duty to believe in the person of Christ. And if to believe in Christ be
   no more but to believe the doctrine of the Gospel which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   revealed, then every one whose doctrine we are obliged to believe, on
   them we ought to call also. And on this ground, we may call on the
   names of the prophets and apostles, as well as on the name of Jesus
   Christ, and be saved thereby. But whereas invocation or prayer
   proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> from faith, and that prayer is for mercy, grace, life, and
   eternal salvation; faith must be fixed on the person so called on, as
   able to give them all to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, or that prayer is in vain.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, Again, that we are baptized into the name of Jesus Christ, and
   that distinctly with the Father, is a sufficient evidence of the
   necessity of faith in his person; for we are in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> given up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   universal spiritual subjection of soul to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and dependence on him.
   Not to believe in him, on his name -- that is, his person -- when we
   are so given up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, or baptized into him, is virtually to
   renounce him. But to put a present close to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this contest: Faith in
   Christ is that grace through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the church is united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him --
   incorporated into one mystical body with him. It is thereby that he
   dwells in them, and they in him. By this alone are all supplies of
   grace derived from him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole body. Deny his person to be the
   proper and immediate object of this faith, and all these things are
   utterly overthrown -- that is, the whole spiritual life and eternal
   salvation of the church.
				</p><p>
   This faith in the person of Christ, which is the foundation of all that
   divine honour in sacred adoration and invocation which is assigned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him, may be considered two ways. First, as it respects his person
   absolutely; Secondly, As he is considered in the discharge of the
   office of mediation.
				</p><p>
   First, In the first sense, faith is placed absolutely and ultimately on
   the person of Christ, even as on the person of the Father. He counts it
   no robbery in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> to be equal with the Father. And the reason of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   is, because the divine nature itself is the proper and immediate object
   of this faith, and all the acts of it. This being one and the same in
   the person of the Father and of the Son, as also of the Holy Spirit,
   two things do follow upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. 1. That each person is equally the object
   of our faith, because equally participant of that nature which is the
   formal reason and object of it. 2. It follows also, that in acting
   faith on, and ascribing with that<note n="therewithal">Auto-modernized</note> divine honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, any one person,
   the others are not excluded; yea, they are included in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. For by
   reason of the mutual inbeing of the Divine persons in the unity of the
   same nature, the object of all spiritual worship is undivided. Hence
   are those expressions of the Scriptures, "He that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen the Son,
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> seen the Father; he that honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> the Father,
   for he and the Father are one."
				</p><p>
   And to clear our present design, three things may be observed from
   hence; namely, that the divine nature, with all its essential
   properties, is the formal reason and only ground of divine faith. As--
				</p><p>
   1^st, That the Lord Christ is not the absolute and ultimate object of
   our faith, any otherwise but under this consideration, of his being
   partaker of the nature of God -- of his being in the form of God, and
   equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Without this, to place our faith in him would be
   robbery and sacrilege; as is all the pretended faith of them who
   believe not his divine person.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, There is no derogation from the honour and glory of the Father
   -- not the least diversion of any one signal act of duty from him, nor
   from the Holy Spirit -- by the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> acting of faith on the person
   of Christ; for all divine honour is given solely to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine
   nature: and this being absolutely the same in each person, in the
   honouring of one, they are all equally honoured. He that honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Son, he in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> honours<note n="honoureth">Auto-modernized</note> the Father also.
				</p><p>
   3^dly, Hence it appears what is that special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> acting of faith on the
   person of Christ which we intend, and which in the Scripture is given
   in charge to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as indispensably necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our salvation. And
   there are three things to be considered in it.
				</p><p>
   (1^st,) That his divine nature is the proper formal object of this
   faith, on the consideration of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> alone it is fixed on him. If you
   ask a reason why I believe on the Son of God -- if you intend what
   cause I have for it, what motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it -- I shall answer, It is
   because of what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done for me, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> afterwards. So does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   apostle, <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference> But if you intend, what is the formal reason,
   ground, and warranty whereon I thus believe in him, or place my trust
   and confidence in him, I say it is only this, that he is "over all, God
   blessed for ever;" and were he not so, I could not believe in him. For
   to believe in any, is to expect from him that to be done for me which
   none but God can do.
				</p><p>
   (2^dly,) That the entire person of Christ, as God and man, is the
   immediate object of our faith in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>. The divine nature is the reason
   of it; but his divine person is the object of it. In placing our faith
   on him, we consider him as God and man in one and the same person. We
   believe in him because he is God; but we believe in him as he is God
   and man in one person.
				</p><p>
   And this consideration of the person of Christ -- namely, as he is God
   and man -- in our acting of faith on him, is that which renders it
   peculiar, and limits or determines it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person, because he only
   is so; -- the Father is not, nor the Holy Spirit. That faith which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   the person of God and man for its object, is peculiarly and distinctly
   placed on Christ.
				</p><p>
   (3^dly,) The motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this distinct acting of faith on his person
   are always to be considered as those also which render this faith
   peculiar. For the things which Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done for us, which are the
   motives of our faith in him, were peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him alone; as in the
   place before quoted, <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference> Such are all the works of his
   mediation, with all the fruits of them, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are made partakers.
   So God, in the first command, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he requires all faith, love, and
   obedience from the church, enforced it with the consideration of a
   signal benefit which it had received, and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> a type of all
   spiritual and eternal mercies, <reference osisRef="Exod.20.2 Exod.20.3">Exodus 20:2-3</reference> Hence two things are
   evident, which clearly state this matter.
				</p><p>
   [1^st,] That faith which we place upon and the honour which we give
   thereby to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, is equally placed on and honour
   equally given thereby to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the other persons of the Father and the Holy
   Spirit, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that nature which is the formal reason and
   cause of it. But it is peculiarly fixed on Christ, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his person as God and man, and the motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, in the acts and
   benefits of his mediation.
				</p><p>
   [2^dly,] All of Christ is considered and glorified in this acting of
   faith on him; -- his divine nature, as the formal cause of it; his
   divine entire person, God and man, as its proper object; and the
   benefits of his mediation, as the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> motives to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   This faith in the person of Christ is the spring and fountain of our
   spiritual life. We live by the faith of the Son of God. In and by the
   actings of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is it preserved, increased, and strengthened. "For he is
   our life," <reference osisRef="Col.3.4">Colossians 3:4</reference>; and all supplies of it are derived from him, by
   the acting of faith in him. We receive the forgiveness of sins, and an
   inheritance among them that are sanctified, "by the faith that is in
   him," <reference osisRef="Acts.26.18">Acts 26:18</reference> Hereby do we abide in him; without which we can do
   nothing, <reference osisRef="John.15.5">John 15:5</reference> Hereby is our peace with God maintained -- "For he
   is our peace," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.14">Ephesians 2:14</reference>; and in him we have peace, according to his
   promise, <reference osisRef="John.16.33">John 16:33</reference> All strength for the mortification of sin, for
   the conquest of temptations -- all our increase and growth in grace --
   depend on the constant actings of this faith in him.
				</p><p>
   The way and method of this faith is that which we have described. A due
   apprehension of the love of Christ, with the effects of it in his whole
   mediatory work on our behalf -- especially in his giving himself for
   us, and our redemption by his blood -- is the great motive to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
   They whose hearts are not deeply affected with this<note n="herewith">Auto-modernized</note>, can never believe
   in him in a due manner. "I live," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle, "by the faith of
   the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." Unless a sense
   of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> be firmly implanted in our souls, unless we are deeply affected
   with it, our faith in him would be weak and wavering, or rather none at
   all. The due remembrance of what the blessed Lord Jesus has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done for
   us, of the ineffable love which was the spring, cause, and fountain of
   what he so did -- thoughts of the mercy, grace, peace, and glory which
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> procured thereby -- are the great and unconquerable motives to
   fix our faith, hope, trust, and confidence in him.
				</p><p>
   His divine nature is the ground and warranty for our so doing. This is
   that from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is the due and proper object of all divine faith
   and worship. From the power and virtue of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> do we expect and receive
   all those things which in our believing on him we seek after; for none
   but God can bestow them on us, or work them in us. There is in all the
   acting of our faith on him, the voice of the confession of Thomas, "My
   Lord and my God."
				</p><p>
   His divine person, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is God and man, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> that
   nature which is the formal object of divine worship, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he
   wrought all those things which are the motives to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, is the object
   of this faith; which gives its difference and distinction from faith in
   God in general, and faith in the person of the Father, as the fountain
   of grace, love, and power.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, Faith is acted on Christ under the formal notion of mediator
   between God and man. So it is expressed, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.21">1 Peter 1:21</reference>, "Who by him do
   believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory;
   that your faith and hope might be in God." And this acting of faith
   towards Christ is not contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that before described, nor
   inconsistent with it, though it be distinct from it. To deny the person
   of Christ to fall under this double consideration -- of a divine person
   absolutely, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is "over all, God blessed for ever," and, as
   manifested in the flesh, exercising the office of mediator between God
   and man -- is to renounce the Gospel. And according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the variety of
   these respects, so are the acting of faith various; some on him
   absolutely, on the motives of his mediation; some on him as mediator
   only. And how necessary this variety is to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the life, support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note>, and
   comfort of believers, they all know in some measure who are so. See our
   exposition on <reference osisRef="Heb.1.1 Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:1-3</reference> Sometimes faith considers him as on the
   throne; sometimes as standing at the right hand of God; sometimes as
   the mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus. Sometimes his
   glorious power, sometimes his infinite condescension, is their relief.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, in the sense now intended, he is considered as the
   ordinance, as the servant of God, "who raised him up from the dead, and
   gave him glory." So our faith respects not only his person, but all the
   acts of his office. It is faith in his blood, <reference osisRef="Rom.3.25">Romans 3:25</reference> It is the
   will of God, that we should place our faith and trust in him and them,
   as the only means of our acceptance with him -- of all grace and glory
   from him. This is the proper notion of a mediator. So is he not the
   ultimate object of our faith, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it rests, but God through him.
   "Through him have we access by one Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father," <reference osisRef="Eph.2.18">Ephesians 2:18</reference> So he is the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we go to God, <reference osisRef="John.14.6">John 14:6</reference>; see <reference osisRef="Heb.10.19 Heb.10.20 Heb.10.21 Heb.10.22">Hebrews 10:19-22</reference> And this so is faith in him; because he is the immediate, though
   not the ultimate, object of it, <reference osisRef="Acts.26.18">Acts 26:18</reference>
				</p><p>
   This is that which renders our faith in God evangelical. The special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>
   nature of it arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from our respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in Christ, and through
   him. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> faith principally regards Christ in the discharge of
   his sacerdotal office. For although it is also the principle of all
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in his other offices, yet as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> fixing our faith
   in God through him, it is his sacerdotal office and the effects of it
   that we rest upon and trust to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. It is through him as the high priest
   over the house of God, as he who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made for us a new and living way
   into the holy place, that we draw nigh to God, <reference osisRef="Heb.4.14 Heb.4.15 Heb.4.16">Hebrews 4:14-16</reference>; x. 19-22
   <reference osisRef="1John.1.3">1 John 1:3</reference>
				</p><p>
   No comfortable, refreshing thoughts of God, no warrantable or
   acceptable boldness in an approach and access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, can any one
   entertain or receive, but in this exercise of faith on Christ as the
   mediator between God and man. And if, in the practice of religion, this
   regard of faith to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- this acting of faith on God through him --
   be not the principle through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the whole is animated and guided,
   Christianity is renounced, and the vain cloud of natural religion
   embraced in the room of it. Not a verbal mention of Him, but the real
   intention of heart to come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by him, is required of us; and
   into that<note n="thereinto">Auto-modernized</note> all expectation of acceptance with God, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our persons
   or duties, is resolved.
				</p><p>
   We have had great endeavours of late, by the Socinians, to set forth
   and adorn a natural religion; as if it were sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all ends of
   our living to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. But as most of its pretended ornaments are stolen
   from the Gospel, or are framed in an emanation of light from it, such
   as nature of itself could not rise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; so the whole proceeds from a
   dislike of the mediation of Christ, and even weariness of the
   profession of faith in him. So is it with the minds of men who were
   never affected with supernatural revelations, with the mystery of the
   Gospel, beyond the owning of some notions of truth -- who never had
   experience of its power in the life of God.
				</p><p>
   But here lies the trial of faith truly evangelical. Its steady
   beholding of the Sun of Righteousness proves it genuine and from above.
   And let them take heed who find their heart remiss or cold in this
   exercise of it. When men begin to satisfy themselves with general hopes
   of mercy in God, without a continual respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the interposition and
   mediation of Christ, into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> their hope and trust is resolved, there
   is a decay in their faith, and proportionally in all other evangelical
   graces also. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> lies the mystery of Christian religion, which the
   world seems to be almost weary of.

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 11 Obedience to Christ The Nature and Causes of it">
<title>Chapter 11 Obedience to Christ -- The Nature and Causes of it.</title>
<p>   II. All holy obedience, both internal and external is that which we
   proposed as the second part of our religious regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of
   Christ. His great injunction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples is, "That they keep his
   commandments" -- without which, none are so.
				</p><p>
   Some say the Lord Christ is to be considered as a lawgiver, and the
   Gospel as a new law given by him, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> our obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him is to
   be regulated. Some absolutely deny it, and will not grant the Gospel in
   any sense to be a new law. And many dispute about these things, whilst
   obedience itself is on all hands generally neglected. But this is that
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our principal concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> lie. I shall not, therefore, at
   present, immix myself in any needless disputations. Those things
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the nature and necessity of our obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him is
   concerned, shall be briefly declared.
				</p><p>
   The law under the Old Testament, taken generally, had two parts, --
   first, the moral preceptive part of it; and, secondly, the institutions
   of worship appointed for that season. These are jointly and distinctly
   called the law.
				</p><p>
   In respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the first of these, the Lord Christ gave no new law,
   nor was the old abrogated by him -- which it must be if another were
   given in the room of it, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same ends. For the introduction of a
   new law in the place of and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of a former, is an actual
   abrogation of it. Neither did he add any new precepts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, nor give
   any counsels for the performance of duties in matter or manner beyond
   what it prescribed. Any such supposition is contrary to the wisdom and
   holiness of God in giving the law, and inconsistent with the nature of
   the law itself. For God never required less of us in the law than all
   that was due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; and his prescription of it included all
   circumstances and causes that might render any duty at any time
   necessary in the nature or degree of it. Whatever at any time may
   become the duty of any person towards God, in the substance or degrees
   of it, it is made so by the law. All is included in that summary of it,
   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour
   as thyself." Nothing can be the duty of men but what and when it is
   required by the love of God or our neighbour. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, no additions
   were made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the preceptive part of the law by our Saviour, nor
   counsels given by him for the performance of more than it did require.
				</p><p>
   In this regard the Gospel is no new law; -- only the duties of the
   moral and eternal law are plainly declared in the doctrine of it,
   enforced in its motives, and directed as to their manner and end. Nor
   in this sense did the Lord Christ ever declare himself to be a new
   lawgiver; yea, he declares the contrary -- that he came to confirm the
   old, <reference osisRef="Matt.5.17">Matthew 5:17</reference>
				</p><p>
   Secondly, The law may be considered as containing the institutions of
   worship which were given in Horeb by Moses, with other statutes and
   judgments. It was in this sense abolished by Christ. For the things
   themselves were appointed but to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the time of reformation. And
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, as the supreme Lord and lawgiver of the Gospel Church, he gave
   a new law of worship, consisting in several institutions and ordinances
   of worship to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> belonging. See <reference osisRef="Heb.3.3 Heb.3.4 Heb.3.5 Heb.3.6">Hebrews 3:3-6</reference>, and our explanation
   of that place.
				</p><p>
   Obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ may be considered with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> both
   these; -- the moral law which he confirmed, and the law of evangelical
   worship which he gave and appointed. And some few things may be added
   to clear the nature of it.
				</p><p>
   1. Obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not consist merely in doing the things
   which he requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>. So far the church under the Old Testament was
   obliged to yield obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Moses; and we are yet so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   prophets and apostles This is done, or may be so, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any
   subordinate directive cause of our obedience, when it is not formally
   so denominated from his authority. All obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ proceeds
   from an express subjection of our souls and consciences to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   2. No religious obedience could be due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ directly,
   by the rule and command of the moral law, were he not God by nature
   also. The reason and foundation of all the obedience required in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>
   is, "I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have no other gods before me."
   This contains the formal reason of our religious obedience. The
   Socinians pretend highly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience to the precepts of Christ; but
   all obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ himself they utterly overthrow. The obedience
   they pretend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, is but obeying God the Father according to his
   commands; but they take away the foundation of all obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   person, by denying his divine nature. And all religious obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   any who is not God by nature, is idolatry. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, all obedience
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, due by the moral law, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ,
   as one God with the Father and Holy Spirit, blessed for ever.
				</p><p>
   3. There is a peculiar respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in all moral obedience as
   Mediator.
				</p><p>
   (1.) In that by the supreme authority over the church with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> he was
   vested, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> confirmed all the commands of the moral law, giving
   them new enforcements; from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he calls them his commands. "This," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>
   he, "is my commandment, That ye love one another;" which yet was the
   old commandment of the moral law, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself." Hence the apostle calls it an old and new commandment, <reference osisRef="1John.2.7 1John.2.8">1 John 2:7-8</reference>
				</p><p>
   This law was given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church under the Old Testament in the hand
   of a mediator; that is, of Moses, <reference osisRef="Gal.3.19">Galatians 3:19</reference> It had an original
   power of obliging all mankind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience, from its first
   institution or prescription in our creation; which it never lost nor
   abated in. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> the church was obliged to have a respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, as
   it was given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, "ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
   See <reference osisRef="Mal.4.4">Malachi 4:4</reference> Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> many things hard and difficult did ensue, which
   we are now freed from. We are not obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the observance of the
   moral law itself, as given in the hand of that mediator, which gave it
   the formal reason of a covenant to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that people, and had other
   statutes and judgments inseparable from it. But the same law continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note>
   still in its original authority and power, which it had from the
   beginning, to oblige all indispensably to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience.
				</p><p>
   Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, as the Church of Israel, as such, was not obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the moral law absolutely considered, but as it was given
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them peculiarly in the hand of a mediator -- that is, of Moses; no
   more is the Evangelical Church, as such, obliged by the original
   authority of that law, but as it is confirmed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the hand of
   our Mediator. This renders all our moral obedience evangelical. For
   there is no duty of it, but we are obliged to perform it in faith
   through Christ, on the motives of the love of God in him, of the
   benefits of his mediation, and the grace we receive by him: whatever is
   otherwise done by us is not acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
				</p><p>
   They do, therefore, for the most part, but deceive themselves and
   others, who talk so loudly about moral duties. I know of none that are
   acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, which are not only materially, but formally so,
   and no more.
				</p><p>
   If the obligation they own to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them be only the original power of the
   moral law, or the law of our creation, and they are performed in the
   strength of that law to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of it, they are no way accepted of
   God. But if they intend the duties which the moral law requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note>,
   proceeding from, and performed by, faith in Christ, upon the grounds of
   the love of God in him, and grace received from him -- then are they
   duties purely evangelical. And although the law has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> never lost, nor
   ever can lose, its original power of obliging us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> universal
   obedience, as we are reasonable creatures; yet is our obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it
   as Christians, as believers, immediately influenced by its confirmation
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Evangelical Church in the hand of our Mediator. For --
				</p><p>
   (2.) God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ all power in his name, to
   require this obedience from all that receive the Gospel. Others are
   left under the original authority of the Law, either as implanted in
   our natures at their first creation, as are the Gentiles; or as
   delivered by Moses, and written in tables of stone, as it was with the
   Jews, <reference osisRef="Rom.2.12 Rom.2.13 Rom.2.14 Rom.2.15">Romans 2:12-15</reference> But as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that are called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the faith
   of the Gospel, the authority of Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> immediately affect their
   minds and consciences. "He feeds" or rules his people "in the strength
   of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God," <reference osisRef="Mic.5.4">Micah 5:4</reference> All the authority and majesty of God is in him and with him; -- so
   of old, as the great Angel of God's presence, he was in the church in
   the wilderness with a delegated power, <reference osisRef="Exod.23.20 Exod.23.21 Exod.23.22">Exodus 23:20-22</reference>: "Behold, I
   send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee
   into the place which I have prepared: beware of him, and obey his
   voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for
   my name is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all
   that I speak," etc.. The name of God the Father is so in him -- that is,
   he is so partaker of the same nature with him -- that his voice is the
   voice of the Father: "If thou obey his voice, and do all that I speak."
   Nevertheless, he acts in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> as the Angel of God, with power and
   authority delegated from him. So is he still immediately present with
   the church, requiring obedience in the name and majesty of God.

   (3.) All judgment upon and concerning this obedience is committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him by the Father: "For the Father judges<note n="judgeth">Auto-modernized</note> no man," (that is,
   immediately as the Father,) "but has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> committed all judgment to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Son," <reference osisRef="John.5.22">John 5:22</reference>; He "has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> given him authority to execute judgment,
   because he is the Son of man," verse 27. And his judgment is the
   judgment of God; for the Father, who judges<note n="judgeth">Auto-modernized</note> none immediately in his
   own person, judges<note n="judgeth">Auto-modernized</note> all in him, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.17">1 Peter 1:17</reference>: "If ye call on the
   Father, who without respect of persons judges<note n="judgeth">Auto-modernized</note> according to every man's
   work." He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so in and by the Son, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom all judgment is
   committed. And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him are we to have regard in all our obedience,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom we must give our account concerning it, and by whom we are
   and must be finally judged upon it. To this purpose speaks the apostle,
   <reference osisRef="Rom.14.10 Rom.14.11 Rom.14.12">Romans 14:10-12</reference>, "We shall all stand before the judgment-seat of
   Christ. For it is written, As I live, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord, every knee shall
   bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of
   us shall give account of himself to God." He proves<note n="proveth">Auto-modernized</note> that we shall all
   stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, or be judged by him, by a
   testimony of Scripture that we shall be also judged by God himself, and
   give an account of ourselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And as this does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> undeniably
   prove and confirm the divine nature of Christ, without the faith
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> there is neither cogency in the apostle's testimony nor force
   in his arguing; so he declares that God judges<note n="judgeth">Auto-modernized</note> us only in and by him.
   In this regard of our moral obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ lies the way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   God will be gloried.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, All things are yet more plain with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> institutions
   of divine worship. The appointment of all divine ordinances under the
   New Testament was his special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> province and work, as the Son and Lord
   over his own house; and obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in the observance of them is
   that which he gives in special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> charge to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all his disciples, <reference osisRef="Matt.28.18 Matt.28.19 Matt.28.20">Matthew 28:18-20</reference> And it is nothing but a loss of that subjection of soul
   and conscience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him which is indispensably required of all
   believers, that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> set the minds of so many at liberty to do and
   observe in divine worship what they please, without any regard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   institutions. It is otherwise with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> moral duties; for the
   things of the moral law have an obligation on our consciences
   antecedent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enforcement of them by the authority of Christ, and
   there hold us fast. But as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> things of the latter sort, our
   consciences can no way be affected with a sense of them, or a necessity
   of obedience in them, but by the sole and immediate authority of Christ
   himself. If a sense of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> be lost in our minds, we shall not abide in
   the observance of his commands.

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 12 The special Principle of Obedience to the Person of Christ which is Love Its Truth and Reality Vindicated">
<title>Chapter 12 The special Principle of Obedience to the Person of Christ; which is Love -- Its Truth and Reality Vindicated.</title>
<p>   That which does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> enliven and animate the obedience of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we have
   discoursed, is love. This himself makes the foundation of all that is
   acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. "If," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "ye love me, keep my
   commandments," <reference osisRef="John.14.15">John 14:15</reference> As he distinguishes<note n="distinguisheth">Auto-modernized</note> between love and
   obedience, so he asserts the former as the foundation of the latter. He
   accepts of no obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his commands that does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not proceed from
   love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person. That is no love which is not fruitful in
   obedience; and that is no obedience which proceeds not from love. So he
   expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> on both sides: "If a man love me, he will keep my words;"
   and, "He that loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> me not keeps<note n="keepeth">Auto-modernized</note> not my sayings," verses 23, 24.
				</p><p>
   In the Old Testament the love of God was the life and substance of all
   obedience. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
   all thy soul, thy mind and strength," was the sum of the law. This
   includes in it all obedience, and, where it is genuine, will produce
   all the fruits of it; and where it was not, no multiplication of duties
   was accepted with him. But this in general we do not now treat of.
				</p><p>
   That the person of Christ is the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> object of this divine love,
   which is the fire that kindles the sacrifice of our obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   -- this is that alone which at present I design to demonstrate.
				</p><p>
   The apostle has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> recorded a very severe denunciation of divine wrath
   against all that love him not: "If any man love not the Lord Jesus
   Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha," <reference osisRef="1Cor.16.22">1 Corinthians 16:22</reference> And what was
   added to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the curse of the Law we may add to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this of the Gospel:
   "And all the people shall say, Amen," <reference osisRef="Deut.27.26">Deuteronomy 27:26</reference> And, on the
   other hand, he prays for grace on all that "love him in sincerity,"
   <reference osisRef="Eph.6.24">Ephesians 6:24</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, none who desire to retain the name of
   Christian, can deny, in words at least, but that we ought, with all our
   hearts, to love the Lord Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   I do not so distinguish love from obedience as though it were not
   itself a part, yea, the chiefest part, of our obedience. So is faith
   also; yet is it constantly distinguished from obedience, properly so
   called. This alone is that which I shall demonstrate -- namely, that
   there is, and ought to be, in all believers, a divine, gracious love
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, immediately fixed on him, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they are
   excited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and acted in, all their obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his authority. Had
   it been only pleaded, that many who pretend love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ do yet
   evidence that they love him not, it is that which the Scripture
   testifies<note n="testifieth">Auto-modernized</note>, and continual experience does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> proclaim. If an application
   of this charge had been made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them whose sincerity in their
   profession of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him can be no way evidenced, it ought to be
   borne with patience, amongst other reproaches of the same kind that are
   cast upon them. And some things are to be premised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   confirmation of our assertion.
				</p><p>
   1. It is granted that there may be a false pretence of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ; and as this pretence is ruinous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of them in whom
   it is, so it ofttimes renders them prejudicial and troublesome to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   others. There ever were, and probably ever will be, hypocrites in the
   church and a false pretence of love is of the essential form of
   hypocrisy. The first great act of hypocrisy, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ,
   was treachery, veiled with a double pretence of love. He cried, "Hail,
   Master! and kissed him," who betrayed him. His words and actions
   proclaimed love, but deceit and treachery were in his heart. Hence the
   apostle prays for grace on them who love the Lord Jesus en aphtharsia
   -- without dissimulation or doubling, without pretences and aims at
   other ends, without a mixture of corrupt affections; that is, in
   sincerity, <reference osisRef="Eph.6.24">Ephesians 6:24</reference> It was prophesied of him, that many who were
   strangers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his grace should lie to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, <reference osisRef="Ps.18.44">Psalms 18:44</reference>, bny nkr
   ykchshvly -- feignedly submit, or yield feigned obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. So
   is it with them who profess love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, yet are enemies of his
   cross, "whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose
   glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things," <reference osisRef="Phil.3.18 Phil.3.19">Philippians 3:18-19</reference>
   All that are called Christians in the world, do, by owning that
   denomination, profess a love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ; but greater enemies,
   greater haters of him, he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not among the children of men, than many
   of them are. This falsely pretended love is worse than avowed hatred;
   neither will the pretence of it stand men in stead at the last day. No
   other answer will be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the plea of it, be it in whom it will,
   but "Depart from me, I never knew you, ye workers of iniquity."
   Whereas, therefore, he himself has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> prescribed this rule to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all who
   would be esteemed his disciples, "If ye love me, keep my commandments,"
   we may safely conclude, all who live in a neglect of his commands,
   whatever they pretend or profess, they love him not. And the
   satisfaction which men, through much darkness, and many corrupt
   prejudices, have attained to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in the profession of Christian religion,
   without an internal, sincere love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ himself, is that which
   ruins religion and their own souls.
				</p><p>
   2. As there is a false pretence of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, so there is, or
   may be, a false love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him also. The persons in whom it is may in
   some measure be sincere, and yet their love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ may not be
   pure, nor sincere -- such as answers the principles and rules of the
   gospel; and as many deceive others, so some deceive themselves in this
   matter. They may think that they love Christ, but indeed do not so; and
   this I shall manifest in some few instances.
				</p><p>
   (1.) That love is not sincere and incorrupt which proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> not from
   -- which is not a fruit of faith. Those who do not first really believe
   on Christ, can never sincerely love him. It is faith alone that works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note>
   by love towards Christ and all his saints. If, therefore, any do not
   believe with that faith which unites them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, which within
   purifies the heart, and is outwardly effectual in duties of obedience,
   whatever they may persuade themselves concerning love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, it
   is but a vain delusion. Where the faith of men is dead, their love will
   not be living and sincere.
				</p><p>
   (2.) That love is not so which arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from false ideas and
   representations that men make of Christ, or have made of him in their
   minds. Men may draw images in their minds of what they most fancy, and
   then dote upon them. So some think of Christ only as a glorious person
   exalted in heaven at the right hand of God, without farther
   apprehensions of his natures and offices. So the Roman missionaries
   represented him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> some of the Indians -- concealing from them his
   cross and sufferings. But every false notion concerning his person or
   his grace -- what he is, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done, or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> -- corrupts the love that
   is pretended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Shall we think that they love Christ by whom his
   divine nature is denied or that those do so who disbelieve the reality
   of his human nature? Or those by whom the union of both in the same
   person is rejected? There cannot be true evangelical love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a false
   Christ, such as these imaginations do fancy.
				</p><p>
   (3.) So is that love which is not in all things -- as to causes,
   motives, measures, and ends -- regulated by the Scripture. This alone
   gives us the nature, rules, and bounds of sincere spiritual love. We
   are no more to love Christ, than to fear and worship him, according
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our own imaginations. From the Scripture are we to derive all the
   principles and motives of our love. If either the acts or effects of it
   will not endure a trial thereby, they are false and counterfeit; and
   many such have been pretended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, as we shall see immediately.
				</p><p>
   (4.) That is so, unquestionably, which fixes<note n="fixeth">Auto-modernized</note> itself on undue objects,
   which, whatever is pretended, are neither Christ nor means of conveying
   our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Such is all that love which the Romanists express in
   their devotion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> images, as they fancy, of Christ; crucifixes,
   pretended relics of his cross, and the nails that pierced him, with the
   like superstitious representations of him, and what they suppose he is
   concerned in. For although they express their devotion with great
   appearance of ardent affections, under all outward signs of them -- in
   adorations, kissings, prostrations, with sighs and tears; yet all this
   while it is not Christ which they thus cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, but a cloud of
   their own imaginations, with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> their carnal minds are pleased and
   affected. That is no god which a man hews out of a tree, though he form
   it for that end, though he falls down to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it and worships<note n="worshippeth">Auto-modernized</note> it, and
   prays<note n="prayeth">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, "Deliver me, for thou art my god," <reference osisRef="Isa.44.17">Isaiah 44:17</reference> The authors of this superstition, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the love of
   innumerable poor souls is depraved and abused, do first frame in their
   minds what they suppose may solicit or draw out the natural and carnal
   affections of men to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and then outwardly represent it as an object
   for them. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> some of their representations of him are glorious,
   and some of them dolorous, according as they aim to excite affections
   in carnal minds. But, as I said, these things are not Christ, nor is he
   any way concerned in them.
				</p><p>
   (5.) I acknowledge there have been great pretences of such a love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ as cannot be justified. Such is that which some of the
   devotionists of the Roman Church have endeavoured rather to express out
   of their fancy than declare out of their experience. Raptures,
   ecstasies, self-annihilations, immediate adhesions and enjoyments,
   without any act of the understanding, and with a multitude of other
   swelling words of vanity, they labour to set off what they fancy to be
   divine love. But there wants not evidences of truth sufficient to
   defeat these pretences, be they ever so specious or glorious. For --
				</p><p>
   [1.] As it is by them described, it exceeds<note n="exceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> all Scripture precedents.
   For men to assume to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves an apprehension that they love Christ
   in another manner and kind, in a higher degree at least, and thence to
   enjoy more intimacy with him, more love from him, than did any of the
   apostles -- John, or Paul, or Peter, or any other of those holy ones
   whose love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him is recorded in the Scripture -- is intolerable
   vanity and presumption. But no such things as these devotees pretend
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> are mentioned, or in the least intimated concerning them, and
   their love to their Lord and Master. No man will pretend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> more love
   than they had, but such as have none at all.
				</p><p>
   [2.] It is no way directed, warranted, approved, by any command,
   promise, or rule of the Scripture. As it is without precedent, so it is
   without precept. And hereby, whether we will or no, all our graces and
   duties must be tried, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any acceptation with God. Whatever
   pretends to exceed the direction of the Word may safely be rejected --
   cannot safely be admitted. Whatever enthusiasms or pretended
   inspirations may be pleaded for the singular practice of what is
   prescribed in the Scripture, yet none can be allowed for an approved
   principle of what is not so prescribed. Whatever exceeds the bounds
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> is resolved into the testimony of every distempered
   imagination. Nor will it avail that these things amongst them are
   submitted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the judgment of the church. For the church has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no rule
   to judge by but the Scripture; and it can pass but one judgment of what
   is not warranted thereby -- namely, that it is to be rejected.
				</p><p>
   [3.] As it is described by those who applaud it, it is not suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the sober, sedate actings of the rational faculties of our souls. For
   whereas all that God requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> of us, is that we love him with all our
   souls and all our minds, these men cry up a divine love by an immediate
   adhesion of the will and the affections to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, without any actings
   of the mind and understanding at all. Love, indeed, is the regular
   acting of our whole souls, by all their faculties and rational powers,
   in an adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. But these men have fancied a divine love for
   them whom they would admire and extol, which disturbs all their regular
   acting, and renders them of little or no use in that which, without
   their due exercise, is nothing but fancy. And hence it is that, under
   pretence of this love, sundry persons among them -- yea, all that have
   pretended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it -- have fallen into such ridiculous excesses and open
   delusions as sufficiently discover the vanity of the love itself
   pretended by them.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> we plead for no other love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ but what
   the Scripture warrants as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its nature; what the gospel requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> of
   us as our duty; what the natural faculties of our minds are suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   and given us for; what they are enabled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> by grace; and without
   which in some degree of sincerity, no man can yield acceptable
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   These things being premised, that which we assert is, that there is,
   and ought to be, in all believers, a religious, gracious love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   person of Christ, distinct from, and the reason of, their obedience
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his commands; -- that is, it is distinct from all other commands;
   but is also itself commanded and required of us in a way of duty.
				</p><p>
   That there is in the church such a love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, the
   Scripture testifies, both in the precepts it gives for it and the
   examples of it. And all those who truly believe cannot apprehend that
   they understand any thing of faith, or love of Christ, or themselves,
   by whom it is called in question. If, therefore, I should enlarge on
   this subject, a great part of the doctrine of the Scripture from first
   to last must be represented and a transcript of the hearts of
   believers, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this love is seated and prevalent, be made,
   according to our ability. And there is no subject that I could more
   willingly enlarge upon. But I must at present contract myself, in
   compliance with my design. Two things only I shall demonstrate: 1. That
   the person of Christ is the object of divine love; 2. What is the
   nature of that love in us; what are the grounds of it, and the motives
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, in them that do believe.
				</p><p>
   In reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the first of these, the ensuing position shall be the
   subject of the remainder of this chapter.
				</p><p>
   The person of Christ is the principal object of the love of God, and of
   the whole creation participant of his image. The reason why I thus
   extend the assertion will appear in the declaration of it.
				</p><p>
   (1.) No small part of the eternal blessedness of the holy God
   consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in the mutual love of the Father and the Son, by the Spirit.
   As he is the only-begotten of the Father, he is the first, necessary,
   adequate, complete object of the whole love of the Father. Hence he
   says of himself, that from eternity he was "by him, as one brought up
   with him: and was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him,"
   <reference osisRef="Prov.8.30">Proverbs 8:30</reference> -- which place was opened before. In him was the
   ineffable, eternal, unchangeable delight and complacency of the Father,
   as the full object of his love. The same is expressed in that
   description of him, <reference osisRef="John.1.18">John 1:18</reference>, "The only-begotten Son, who is in the
   bosom of the Father." His being the only-begotten Son declares his
   eternal relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of the Father, of whom he was begotten
   in the entire communication of the whole divine nature. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> he is in
   the bosom of the Father -- in the eternal embraces of his love, as his
   only-begotten Son. The Father loves, and cannot but love, his own
   nature and essential image in him.
				</p><p>
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> originally is God love: "For God is love," <reference osisRef="1John.4.8">1 John 4:8</reference> This is
   the fountain and prototype of all love, as being eternal and necessary.
   All other acts of love are in God but emanations from hence, and
   effects of it. As he does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note> good because he is good, so he loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note>
   because he is love. He is love eternally and necessarily in this love
   of the Son; and all other workings of love are but acts of his will,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> somewhat of it is outwardly expressed. And all love in the
   creation was introduced from this fountain, to give a shadow and
   resemblance of it.
				</p><p>
   Love is that which contemplative men have always almost adored. Many
   things have they spoken to evince it to be the light, life, lustre and
   glory of the whole creation. But the original and pattern of it was
   always hid from the wisest philosophers of old. Something they reached
   after about God's love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, with rest and complacency in his
   own infinite excellencies; but of this ineffable mutual love of the
   Father and the Son, both in and by that Spirit which proceeds from them
   both, they had neither apprehension nor conjecture. Yet, as in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   the principal part (if we may so speak) of the blessedness of the holy
   God consist, so is it the only fountain and prototype of all that is
   truly called love; -- a blessing and glory which the creation had never
   been made partaker of, but only to express, according to the capacity
   of their several natures, this infinite and eternal love of God! For
   God's love of himself -- which is natural and necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Divine
   Being -- consists in the mutual complacency of the Father and the Son
   by the Spirit. And it was to express himself, that God made any thing
   without himself. He made the heavens and the earth to express his
   being, goodness, and power. He created man "in his own image," to
   express his holiness and righteousness; and he implanted love in our
   natures to express this eternal mutual love of the holy persons of the
   Trinity. But we must leave it under the veil of infinite
   incomprehensibleness; though admiration and adoration of it be not
   without the highest spiritual satisfaction.
				</p><p>
   Again, he is the peculiar object of the love of the Father, of the love
   of God, as he is incarnate -- as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> taken on him, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> now
   discharged, the work of mediation, or continues in the discharge of it;
   that is, the person of Christ, as God-man, is the peculiar object of
   the divine love of the Father. The person of Christ in his divine
   nature is the adequate object of that love of the Father which is "ad
   intra" -- a natural necessary act of the divine essence in its distinct
   personal existence; and the person of Christ as incarnate, as clothed
   with human nature, is the first and full object of the love of the
   Father in those acts of it which are "ad extra", or are towards
   anything without himself. So he declares himself in the prospect of his
   future incarnation and work, "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine
   elect, in whom my soul delights<note n="delighteth">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="Isa.42.1">Isaiah 42:1</reference> The delight of the
   soul of God, his rest and complacency -- which are the great effects of
   love -- are in the Lord Christ, as his elect and servant in the work of
   mediation. And the testimony of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> he renewed twice from heaven
   afterwards, <reference osisRef="Matt.3.17">Matthew 3:17</reference>, "Lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased;" as it is again repeated, <reference osisRef="Matt.17.5">Matthew 17:5</reference> All things are disposed to give a due sense to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us of this
   love of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. The testimony concerning it is twice repeated in
   the same words from heaven. And the words of it are emphatical to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   utmost of our comprehension: "My Son, my servant, mine elect, my
   beloved Son, in whom I rest, in whom I delight, and am well pleased."
   It is the will of God to leave upon our hearts a sense of this love
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ; for his voice came from heaven, not for his sake, who was
   always filled with a sense of this divine love, but for ours, that we
   might believe it.
				</p><p>
   This he pleaded as the foundation of all the trust reposed in him, and
   all the power committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. "The Father loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   given all things into his hand," <reference osisRef="John.3.35">John 3:35</reference> "The Father loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   Son, and shows<note n="showeth">Auto-modernized</note> him all things that himself does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note>," <reference osisRef="John.5.20">John 5:20</reference>John 23,
   26. And the sense or due apprehension of it is the foundation of
   Christian religion. Hence he prays that we may know that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> loved
   him,
				</p><p>
   In this sense, the person of Christ is the proton dektikon -- the first
   recipient subject of all that divine love which extends itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   church. It is all, the whole of it, in the first place fixed upon him,
   and by and through him is communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church. Whatever it
   receives in grace and glory, it is but the streams of this fountain --
   love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself. So he prays for all his disciples, "that the love,"
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them,"
   <reference osisRef="John.17.26">John 17:26</reference> They can be partakers of no other love, neither in
   itself nor in its fruits, but that alone with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> the Father first
   loved him. He loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> him for us all, and us no otherwise but as in him.
   He makes us "accepted in the Beloved," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.6">Ephesians 1:6</reference> He is the Beloved of
   the Father kat' exochen; as in all things he was to have the
   pre-eminence, <reference osisRef="Col.1.18">Colossians 1:18</reference> The love of the body is derived to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it from
   the love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Head; and in the love of him does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> God love the whole
   church, and no otherwise. He loves none but as united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and
   participant of his nature.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the love of the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, as the only begotten,
   and the essential image of his person, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the ineffable delight of
   the divine nature does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist, was the fountain and cause of all love
   in the creation, by an act of the will of God for its representation.
   And the love of God the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ as incarnate,
   being the first adequate object of divine love in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there is
   anything "ad extra," is the fountain and special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> cause of all gracious
   love towards us and in us. And our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ being the only
   outward expression and representation of this love of the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> consists the principal part of our renovation into his
   image. Nothing renders us so like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God as our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus
   Christ, for he is the principal object of his love, -- in him does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> his
   soul rest -- in him is he always well pleased. Wherever this is
   wanting, whatever there may be besides, there is nothing of the image
   of God. He that loves not Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha;
   for he is unlike to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, -- his canal mind is enmity against God.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Among those who are in the image of God, the angels above are of
   the first consideration. We are, indeed, as yet much in the dark to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the things that are "within the veil." They are above us as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   present capacity, and hid from us as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our present state; but there
   is enough in the Scripture to manifest the adhesion of angels to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   person of Christ by divine love. For love proceeding from sight is the
   life of the church above; as love proceeding from faith is the life of
   the church below. And this life the angels themselves do live. For --
				</p><p>
   [1.] They were all, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their inexpressible present advantage and
   security for the future, brought into that recovery and recapitulation
   of all things which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made in him. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> "gathered together in
   one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on
   earth, even in him," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference> The things in heaven, and things on
   earth -- angels above, and men below -- were originally united in the
   love of God. God's love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> springs their mutual love
   between themselves, was a bond of union between them, rendering them
   one complete family of God in heaven and earth, as it is called, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.15">Ephesians 3:15</reference> On the entrance of sin, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> mankind forfeited their
   interest in the love of God, and lost all love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, or anything
   for him, this union was utterly dissolved, and mutual enmity came into
   the place of its principle in love. God is pleased to gather up these
   divided parts of his family into one -- in one head, which is Christ
   Jesus. And as there is hereby a union established again between angels
   and the church in love, so their adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the head, the centre,
   life, and spring of this union, is by love, and no otherwise. It is not
   faith, but love, that is the bond of this union between Christ and
   them; and in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> no small part of their blessedness and glory in heaven
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist.
				</p><p>
   [2.] That worship, adoration, service, and obedience, which they yield
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, are all in like manner animated with love and delight. In
   love they cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, in love they worship and serve him. They had
   a command to worship him on his nativity, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.6">Hebrews 1:6</reference>; and they did it
   with joy, exultation, and praises -- all effects of love and delight --
   <reference osisRef="Luke.2.13 Luke.2.14">Luke 2:13-14</reference> And as they continue about the throne of God, they
   say, with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
   power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
   blessing," <reference osisRef="Rev.5.12">Revelation of John 5:12</reference> Their continual ascription of glory and praise
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him is an effect of reverential love and delight; and from thence
   also is their concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in his gospel and grace, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:9-10</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference> Nor without this love in the highest degree can it be
   conceived how they should be blessed and happy in their continual
   employment. For they are "all ministering spirits, sent forth to
   minister for the heirs of salvation," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.14">Hebrews 1:14</reference> Were they not acted
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> by their fervent love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, they could have no delight in
   their own ministry.
				</p><p>
   We have not, we cannot have, in this world, a full comprehension of the
   nature of angelical love. Our notions are but dark and uncertain, in
   things of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we can have no experience. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, we cannot have
   here a clear intuition into the nature of the love of spirits, whilst
   our own is mixed with what derives from the acting of the animal
   spirits of our bodies also. But the blessedness of angels does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   consist in the endowments of their nature -- that they are great in
   power, light, knowledge, and wisdom; for, notwithstanding these things,
   many of them became devils. But the excellency and blessedness of the
   angelical state consist in these two things:  1^st, That they are
   disposed, and able constantly, inseparably, universally,
   uninterruptedly, to cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in love. And as they do so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, so they do to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ; and through him, as their
   head, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, even the Father. 2^dly, Add to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> that gracious
   reflex sense which they have of the glory, dignity, eternal sweetness,
   and satisfaction, which arise from hence, and we have the sum of
   angelical blessedness.
				</p><p>
   (3.) The church of mankind is the other part of the rational creation
   whereon the image of God is renewed. Love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ,
   proceeding from faith, is their life, their joy, and glory.
				</p><p>
   It was so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church under the Old Testament. The whole Book of
   Canticles is designed to no other purpose, but variously to shadow
   forth, to insinuate and represent, the mutual love of Christ and the
   church. Blessed is he who understands the sayings of that book, and
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the experience of them in his heart. The 45^th Psalm, among
   others, is designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same purpose. All the glorious
   descriptions which are given of his person in the residue of the
   prophets, were only means to excite love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and desires after
   him. Hence is he called chmdt klhgvm, <reference osisRef="Hag.2.7">Haggai 2:7</reference>, "The Desire of all
   nations" -- he alone who is desirable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and the only beloved of the
   church gathered out of all nations.
				</p><p>
   The clear revelation of the person of Christ, so as to render him the
   direct object of our love, with the causes and reasons of it, is one of
   the most eminent privileges of the New Testament. And it is variously
   attested in precepts, promises, instances, and solemn approbations.
				</p><p>
   Wherever he supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> or requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> this love in any of his disciples,
   it is not only as their duty, as that which they were obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> by
   the precepts of the Gospel, but as that without which no other duty
   whatever is accepted by him. "If," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he "ye love me, keep my
   commandments," <reference osisRef="John.14.15">John 14:15</reference> He so requires love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, as not
   to expect or approve of any obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his commands without it. It
   is a great and blessed duty to feed the sheep and lambs of Christ; yet
   will not he accept of it unless it proceeds out of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   person. "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Feed my lambs," <reference osisRef="John.21.15 John.21.16 John.21.17">John 21:15-17</reference> Three times did he repeat the same words to him who had failed
   in his love towards him, by denying him thrice. Without this love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him, he requires of none to feed his sheep, nor will accept of what
   they pretend to do in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. It were a blessed thing, if a due
   apprehension of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> did always abide with them that are called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   that work.
				</p><p>
   To this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he annex those blessed promises which comprise the whole
   of our peace, safety, and consolation in this world. "He," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he,
   "that loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and
   manifest myself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him," <reference osisRef="John.14.21">John 14:21</reference>; and verse 23, "My Father will
   love him, and we will come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and make our abode with him." What
   heart can conceive, what tongue can express, the glory of these
   promises, or the least part of the grace that is contained in them? Who
   can conceive aright of the divine condescension, love, and grace that
   are expressed in them? How little a portion is it that we know of God
   in these things! But if we value them not, if we labour not for an
   experience of them according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our measure, we have neither lot nor
   portion in the gospel. The presence and abode of God with us as a
   Father, manifesting himself to be such to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, in the infallible
   pledges and assurances of our adoption -- the presence of Christ with
   us, revealing himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, with all those ineffable mercies
   with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> these things are accompanied -- are all contained in them.
   And these promises are peculiarly given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that love the person
   of Christ, and in the exercise of love towards him.
				</p><p>
   To this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> are designed the Gospel Gerizim and Ebal -- the denunciation
   of blessings and curses. As blessings are declared to be their portion
   "who love the Lord Jesus in sincerity," <reference osisRef="Eph.6.24">Ephesians 6:24</reference>, -- so those who
   love him not, have the substance of all curses denounced against them,
   even "Anathema Maranatha," <reference osisRef="1Cor.16.22">1 Corinthians 16:22</reference> So far shall such persons
   be, whatever they may profess of outward obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Gospel,
   from any blessed interest in the promises of it, as that they are
   justly liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> final excision from the church in this world, and
   eternal malediction in that which is to come.
				</p><p>
   It is evident, therefore, that the love of the church of believers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the person of Christ is not a distempered fancy, not a deluding
   imagination, as some have blasphemed; but that which the nature of
   their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him makes necessary -- that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they express
   their renovation into the image of God -- that which the Scripture
   indispensably requires of them, and whereon all their spiritual comfort
   do depend. These things being spoken in general, the particular nature,
   effects, operations, and motives of this divine love, must now be
   farther inquired into.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 13 The Nature Operations and Causes of Divine Love as it respects the Person of Christ">
<title>Chapter 13 The Nature, Operations, and Causes of Divine Love, as it respects the Person of Christ.</title>
<p>   That we may the better understand that love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ
   which we plead for, some things must be premised concerning the nature
   of divine love in general; and upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> its application to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   particular acting and exercise of it which we inquire into will be
   plain and easy.
				</p><p>
   God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> endowed our nature with a faculty and ability of fixing our
   love upon himself. Many can understand nothing of love but the
   adherence of their minds and souls to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> things visible and sensible,
   capable of a present natural enjoyment. For things unseen, especially
   such as are eternal and infinite, they suppose they have a veneration,
   a religious respect, a devout adoration; but how they should love them,
   they cannot understand. And the apostle does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> grant that there is a
   greater difficulty in loving things that cannot be seen, than in loving
   those which are always visibly present to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, <reference osisRef="1John.4.20">1 John 4:20</reference> Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>,
   this divine love has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a more fixed station and prevalence in the minds
   of men than any other kind of love whatever. For --
				</p><p>
   1. The principal end why God endued our natures with that great and
   ruling affection, that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the most eminent and peculiar power and
   interest in our souls, was, in the first place, that it might be fixed
   on himself -- that it might be the instrument of our adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him. He did not create this affection in us, that we might be able by
   it to cast ourselves into the embraces of things natural and sensual.
   No affection has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> such power in the soul to cause it to cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its
   object, and to work it into a conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. Most other affections
   are transient in their operations, and work by a transport of nature --
   as anger, joy, fear, and the like; but love is capable of a constant
   exercise, is a spring to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all other affections, and unites the soul
   with an efficacy not easy to be expressed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its object. And shall we
   think that God, who made all things for himself, did create this ruling
   affection in and with our natures, merely that we might be able to turn
   from him, and cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> other things with a power and faculty above
   any we have of adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him? Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, at our first creation,
   and in our primitive condition, love was the very soul and quickening
   principle of the life of God; and on our adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him thereby the
   continuance of our relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him did depend. The law, rule, and
   measure of it was, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, and all thy soul." For this end did God create this affection in
   us. Not only our persons in their nature and being, but in all their
   powers and faculties, were fitted and prepared to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end, of living
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and coming to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of him. And all their exercise
   on created objects was to be directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the
   placing of our love on anything before God, or above him is a formal
   expression of our apostasy from him.
				</p><p>
   2. Divine excellencies are a proper, adequate object of our love. The
   will, indeed, can adhere to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> nothing in love, but what the
   understanding apprehends as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its truth and being; but it is not
   necessary that the understanding do fully comprehend the whole nature
   of that which the will does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so adhere to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Where a discovery is made
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and by the mind of real goodness and amiableness, the will there
   can close with its affections. And these are apprehended as absolutely
   the most perfect in the divine nature and holy properties of it.
   Whereas, therefore, not only that which is the proper object of love is
   in the divine excellencies, but it is there only perfectly and
   absolutely, without the mixture of anything that should give it an
   alloy, as there is in all creatures, they are the most suitable and
   adequate object of our love.
				</p><p>
   There is no greater discovery of the depravation of our natures by sin
   and degeneracy of our wills from their original rectitude, than that --
   whereas we are so prone to the love of other things, and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> do
   seek for satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our souls where it is not to be obtained --
   it is so hard and difficult to raise our hearts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the love of God.
				</p><p>
   Were it not for that depravation, he would always appear as the only
   suitable and satisfactory object to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our affections.
				</p><p>
   3. The special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> object of divine, gracious love, is the divine
   goodness. "How great is his goodness, how great is his beauty!" <reference osisRef="Zech.9.17">Zechariah 9:17</reference> Nothing is amiable or a proper object of love, but what is
   good, and as it is so. Hence divine goodness, which is infinite, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   an absolutely perfect amiableness accompanying it. Because his goodness
   is inexpressible, his beauty is so. "How great is his goodness, how
   great is his beauty!" Hence are we called to give thanks to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord,
   and to rejoice in him -- which are the effects of love -- because he is
   good, <reference osisRef="Ps.106.1">Psalms 106:1</reference>; cxxxvi. 1.
				</p><p>
   Neither is divine goodness the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> object of our love as
   absolutely considered; but we have a respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it as comprehensive
   of all that mercy, grace, and bounty, which are suited to give us the
   best relief in our present condition and an eternal future reward.
   Infinite goodness, exerting itself in all that mercy, grace,
   faithfulness, and bounty, which are needful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our relief and
   blessedness in our present condition, is the proper object of our love.
   Whereas, therefore, this is done only in Christ, there can be no true
   love of the divine goodness, but in and through him alone.
				</p><p>
   The goodness of God, as a creator, preserver, and rewarder, was a
   sufficient, yea, the adequate object of all love antecedently to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   entrance of sin and misery. In them, in God under those considerations,
   might the soul of man find full satisfaction as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its present and
   future blessedness. But since the passing of sin, misery, and death
   upon us, our love can find no amiableness in any goodness -- no rest,
   complacency, and satisfaction in any -- but what is effectual in that
   grace and mercy by Christ, which we stand in need of for our present
   recovery and future reward. Nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> God require of us that we should
   love him otherwise but as he "is in Christ reconciling the world to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   himself." So the apostle fully declares it: "In this was manifested the
   love of God towards us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son
   into the world, that we might live through him. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is love, not
   that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins. And we have known and believed the love that
   God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> to us. God is love; and he that dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in love dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in
   God, and God in him," <reference osisRef="1John.4.9 1John.4.10 1John.4.16">1 John 4:9-10, 16</reference> God is love, of a nature
   infinitely good and gracious, so as to be the only object of all divine
   love. But this love can no way be known, or be so manifested to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us,
   as that we may and ought to love him, but by his love in Christ, his
   sending of him and loving us in him. Before this, without this, we do
   not, we cannot love God. For "in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is love, not that we loved God,
   but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
   sins." This is the cause, the spring and fountain, of all our love to
   him. They are but empty notions and imaginations, which some
   speculative persons please themselves withal, about love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   divine goodness absolutely considered. For however infinitely amiable
   it may be in itself, it is not so really to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, it is not suited
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their state and condition, without the consideration of the
   communications of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in Christ.
				</p><p>
   4. These things being premised, we may consider the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> nature of
   this divine love, although I acknowledge that the least part of what
   believers have an experience of in their own souls can be expressed at
   least by me. Some few things I shall mention, which may give us a
   shadow of it, but not the express image of the thing itself.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Desire of union and enjoyment is the first vital act of this love.
   The soul, upon the discovery of the excellencies of God, earnestly
   desires to be united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them -- to be brought near to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that
   enjoyment of them of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> it is capable, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> alone it can find
   rest and satisfaction. This is essential to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all love; it unites the
   mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its object, and rests not but in enjoyment. God's love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> out of the overflowing of his own immense goodness, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   he will communicate the fruits and effects to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. God is love; and
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his only-begotten Son. Yet also does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this love of God tend to the
   bringing of us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, not that he may enjoy us, but that he may be
   enjoyed by us. This answers the desire of enjoyment in us, <reference osisRef="Job.14.15">Job 14:15</reference>:
   "Thou shalt call me;" (that is, out of the dust at the last day;) "thou
   wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands." God's love will not
   rest, until it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> brought us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself. But our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God
   arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from a sense of our own wants -- our insufficiency to come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   rest in ourselves, or to attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> blessedness by our own endeavours.
   In this state, seeing all in God, and expecting all from the
   suitableness of his excellencies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our rest and satisfaction, our
   souls cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, with a desire of the nearest union of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> our
   natures are capable. We are made for him, and cannot rest until we come
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   Our goodness extends not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God; we cannot profit him by any thing
   that we are, or can do. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not respect
   originally to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any good in ourselves, but is a gracious, free act of
   his own. He does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note> good for no other reason but because he is good. Nor
   can his infinite perfections take any cause for their original actings
   without himself. He wants nothing that he would supply by the enjoyment
   of us. But we have indigency in ourselves to cause our love to seek an
   object without ourselves. And so his goodness -- with the mercy, grace,
   and bounty included in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> -- is the cause, reason, and object of our
   love. We love them for themselves; and because we are wanting and
   indigent, we love them with a desire of union and enjoyment -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   we find that our satisfaction and blessedness does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist. Love in
   general unites the mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the object -- the person loving to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   thing or person beloved. So is it expressed in an instance of human,
   temporary, changeable love, -- namely, that of Jonathan to David. His
   soul "was knit with the soul of David, and he loved him as his own
   soul," <reference osisRef="1Sam.18.1">1 Samuel 18:1</reference> Love had so effectually united them, as that
   the soul of David was as his own. Hence are those expressions of this
   divine love, by "cleaving to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, following hard after him,
   thirsting, panting after him," with the like intimations of the most
   earnest endeavours of our nature after union and enjoyment.
				</p><p>
   When the soul has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a view by faith (which nothing else can give it) of
   the goodness of God as manifested in Christ -- that is of the essential
   excellencies of his nature as exerting themselves in him -- it reaches<note n="reacheth">Auto-modernized</note>
   after him with its most earnest embraces, and is restless until it
   comes to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfect fruition. It sees in God the fountain of life, and
   would drink of the "river of his pleasures," <reference osisRef="Ps.36.8 Ps.36.9">Psalms 36:8-9</reference> -- that in
   his "presence is fulness of joy, and at his right hand are pleasures
   for evermore," <reference osisRef="Ps.16.11">Psalms 16:11</reference> It longs and pants to drink of that
   fountain -- to bathe itself in that river of pleasures; and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it
   comes short of present enjoyment, it lives in hopes that when we
   "awake, it shall be satisfied with his likeness," <reference osisRef="Ps.17.15">Psalms 17:15</reference> There
   is nothing grievous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a soul filled with this love, but what keeps
   it from the full enjoyment of these excellencies of God. What does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so
   naturally and necessarily, it groans under. Such is our present state
   in the body, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, in some sense, we are "absent from the Lord," <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.4 2Cor.5.8 2Cor.5.9">2 Corinthians 5:4, 8-9</reference> And what does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so morally, in the deviations of its
   will and affections, as sin -- it hates and abhors and loathes itself
   for. Under the conduct of this love, the whole tendency of the soul is
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of God; -- it would be lost in itself, and found in
   him, -- nothing in itself, and all in him. Absolute complacency in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   -- that God is what he is, that he should be what he is, and nothing
   else, and that as such we may be united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and enjoy Him
   according to the capacity of our natures is the life of divine love.
				</p><p>
   (2.) It is a love of assimilation. It contains in it a desire and
   intense endeavour to be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our capacity and
   measure. The soul sees all goodness, and consequently all that is
   amiable and lovely, in God -- the want of all which it finds in itself.
   The fruition of his goodness is that which it longs for as its utmost
   end, and conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it as the means of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. There is no man who
   loves not God sincerely, but indeed he would have him to be somewhat
   that he is not, that he might be the more like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. This such
   persons are pleased withal whilst they can fancy it in any thing, <reference osisRef="Ps.50.21">Psalms 50:21</reference> They that love him, would have him be all that he is -- as he
   is, and nothing else; and would be themselves like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And as
   love has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> this tendency, and is that which gives disquiet<note n="disquietment">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   soul when and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we are unlike to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, so it stirs up constant
   endeavours after assimilation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a principal efficacy
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end. Love is the principle that actually assimilates and
   conforms us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, as faith is the principle which originally
   disposes<note n="disposeth">Auto-modernized</note> to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. In our renovation into the image of God, the
   transforming power is radically seated in faith, but acts itself by
   love. Love proceeding from faith gradually changes<note n="changeth">Auto-modernized</note> the soul into the
   likeness of God; and the more it is in exercise, the more is that
   change effected.
				</p><p>
   To labour after conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by outward actions only, is to make
   an image of the living God, hewed out of the stock of a dead tree. It
   is from this vital principle of love that we are not forced into it as
   by engines, but naturally grow up into the likeness and image of God.
   For when it is duly affected with the excellencies of God in Christ, it
   fills the mind with thoughts and contemplations on them, and excites
   all the affections to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a delight in them. And where the soul acts
   itself constantly in the mind's contemplation, and the delight of the
   affections, it will produce assimilation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the object of them. To
   love God is the only way and means to be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   (3.) It is a love of complacency, and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> of benevolence. Upon that
   view which we have by spiritual light and faith of the divine goodness,
   exerting itself in the way before described, our souls do approve of
   all that is in God, applaud it, adore it, and acquiesce in it. Hence
   two great duties do arise, and upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> do they depend. First, Joyful
   ascriptions of glory and honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. All praise and thanksgiving,
   all blessing, all assignation of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, because of his
   excellencies and perfections, do arise from our satisfactory
   complacence in them. The righteous "rejoice in the Lord, and give
   thanks at the remembrance of his holiness," <reference osisRef="Ps.97.12">Psalms 97:12</reference> They are so
   pleased and satisfied at the remembrance of God's holiness, that it
   fills their hearts with joy and causes<note n="causeth">Auto-modernized</note> them to break forth in praises.
   Praise is nothing but an outward expression of the inward complacency
   of our hearts in the divine perfections and their operations. And,
   secondly, Love in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> acts itself by benevolence, as the constant
   inclination of the mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God is
   concerned. It wills all the things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the name of God may be
   sanctified, his praises made glorious, and his will done on earth as it
   is in heaven. As God says of his own love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, that "he will rest
   in his love, he will joy over us [thee] with singing," <reference osisRef="Zeph.3.17">Zephaniah 3:17</reference> --
   as having the greatest complacency in it, rejoicing over us with his
   "whole heart and his whole soul," <reference osisRef="Jer.32.41">Jeremiah 32:41</reference>; -- so, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   our measure, do we by love rest in the glorious excellencies of God,
   rejoicing in them with our whole hearts and our whole souls.
				</p><p>
   (4.) This divine love is a love of friendship. The communion which we
   have with God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is so intimate, and accompanied with such
   spiritual boldness, as gives it that denomination. So Abraham was
   called "The friend of God," <reference osisRef="Isa.41.8">Isaiah 41:8</reference>; <reference osisRef="Jas.2.23">James 2:23</reference> And because of
   that mutual trust which is between friends, "the secret of the Lord is
   with them that fear him, and he will show them his covenant," <reference osisRef="Ps.25.14">Psalms 25:14</reference> For, as our Saviour teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note> us, "servants" -- that is, those who
   are so, and no more -- "know not what their lord does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note>;" he rules them,
   commands them, or requires obedience from them; but as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his secret
   -- his design and purpose, his counsel and love -- they know nothing of
   it. But says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples, "I have called you friends, for
   all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> you,"
   <reference osisRef="John.15.15">John 15:15</reference> He proves them to be rightly called his friends, because
   of the communication of the secret of his mind to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
				</p><p>
   This is the great difference between them who are only servants in the
   house of God, and those who are so servants as to be friends also. The
   same commands are given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all equally, and the same duties are
   required of all equally, inasmuch as they are equally servants; but
   those who are no more but so, know nothing of the secret counsel, love,
   and grace of God, in a due manner. For the natural man receives<note n="receiveth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   the things that are of God. Hence all their obedience is servile. They
   know neither the principal motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it nor the ends of it. But they
   who are so servants as to be friends also, they know what their Lord
   does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note>; the secret of the Lord is with them, and he shows them his
   covenant. They are admitted into an intimate acquaintance with the mind
   of Christ, ("we have the mind of Christ," <reference osisRef="1Cor.2.16">1 Corinthians 2:16</reference>,) and are
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> encouraged to perform the obedience of servants, with the love
   and delight of friends.
				</p><p>
   The same love of friendship is expressed by that intimate converse
   with, and special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> residence that is between God and believers. God
   dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in them, and they dwell in God; for God is love, <reference osisRef="1John.4.16">1 John 4:16</reference> "If a man," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, "love me, he will keep my words:
   and my Father will love him, and we will come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and make our
   abode with him," <reference osisRef="John.14.23">John 14:23</reference>; and, "If any man hear my voice, and open
   the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with
   me," <reference osisRef="Rev.3.20">Revelation of John 3:20</reference> These are not empty sound of words; -- there is
   substance under them, there is truth in them. Those whose hearts are
   duly exercised in and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the love of God have experience of the
   refreshing approaches both of the Father and of the Son to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their
   souls, in the communications of a sense of their love, and pledges of
   their abode with them.
				</p><p>
   These things have I briefly premised, concerning the nature of divine
   love, that we may the better apprehend what we understand by it, in the
   application of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ. For --
				</p><p>
   1. The formal object of this love is the essential properties of the
   divine nature -- its infinite goodness in particular. Wherever these
   are, there is the object and reason of this love. But they are all of
   them in the person of the Son, no less than in the person of the
   Father. As, therefore, we love the Father on this account, so are we to
   love the Son also. But --
				</p><p>
   2. The Person of Christ is to be considered as he was incarnate, or
   clothed with our nature. And this takes nothing off from the formal
   reason of this love, but only makes an addition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the motives of it.
   This, indeed, for a season veiled the loveliness of his divine
   excellencies, and so turned aside the eyes of many from him. For when
   he took on him "the form of a servant, and made himself of no
   reputation," he had, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them who looked on him with carnal eyes,
   "neither form nor comeliness," that he should be desired or be loved.
   Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, the entire person of Christ, God and man, is the object of
   this divine love, in all the acts of the whole exercise of it. That
   single effect of infinite wisdom and grace, in the union of the divine
   and human natures in the one person of the Son of God, renders him the
   object of this love in a peculiar manner. The way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we may attain
   this peculiar love, and the motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, shall close these
   considerations.
				</p><p>
   A due consideration of, and meditation on, the proposal of the person
   of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the Scripture, are the proper foundation of this
   love. This is the formal reason of our faith in him, and love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
   He is so proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the Scripture, that we may believe in him
   and love him, and for that very end. And in particular with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our love, to ingenerate it in us, and to excite it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its due
   exercise, are those excellencies of his person -- as the principal
   effect of divine wisdom and goodness, which we have before insisted on
   -- frequently proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. To this end is he represented as
   "altogether lovely," and the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> glories of his person are
   delineated, yea, drawn to the life, in the holy records of the Old and
   New Testaments. It is no work of fancy or imagination -- it is not the
   feigning images in our minds of such things as are meet to satisfy our
   carnal affections, to excite and act them; but it is a due adherence
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that object which is represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faith in the proposal of the
   gospel. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, as in a glass, do we behold the glory of Christ, who
   is the image of the invisible God, and have our souls filled with
   transforming affections to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   The whole Book of Canticles is nothing but a mystical declaration of
   the mutual love between Christ and the church. And it is expressed by
   all such ways and means as may represent it intense, fervent, and
   exceeding all other love whatever; which none, I suppose, will deny, at
   least on the part of Christ. And a great part of it consists in such
   descriptions of the person of Christ and his love as may render him
   amiable and desirable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our souls, even "altogether lovely." To what
   end does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Holy Spirit so graphically describe and represent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us
   the beauty and desirableness of his person, if it be not to ingenerate
   love in us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him? All want of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him on this proposal is the
   effect of prevalent unbelief. It is pretended that the descriptions
   given of Christ in this book are allegorical, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> nothing can
   be gathered or concluded. But God forbid we should so reflect on the
   wisdom and love of the Holy Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church -- that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the faith of the church an empty sound and noise of
   words, without mind or sense. The expressions he uses are figurative,
   and the whole nature of the discourse, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its outward structure,
   is allegorical. But the things intended are real and substantial; and
   the metaphors used in the expression of them are suited, in a due
   attendance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the analogy of faith, to convey a spiritual
   understanding and sense of the things themselves proposed in them. The
   church of God will not part with the unspeakable advantage and
   consolation -- those supports of faith and incentives of love -- which
   it receives by that divine proposal of the person of Christ and his
   love which is made in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, because some men have no experience of them
   nor understanding in them. The faith and love of believers is not to be
   regulated by the ignorance and boldness of them who have neither the
   one nor the other. The title of the 45^th Psalm is, shyr ydydt, "A song
   of loves;" -- that is, of the mutual love of Christ and the church. And
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end -- that our souls may be stirred up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the most ardent
   affection towards him -- is a description given us of his person, as
   "altogether lovely." To what other end is he so evidently delineated in
   the whole harmony of his divine beauties by the pencil of the Holy
   Spirit?
				</p><p>
   Not to insist on particular testimonies, it is evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all whose
   eyes are opened to discern these things, that there is no property of
   the divine nature which is peculiarly amiable -- such as are goodness,
   grace, love, and bounty, with infinite power and holiness -- but it is
   represented and proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the person of the Son of God, to
   this end, that we should love him above all, and cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. There
   is nothing in the human nature, in that fulness of grace and truth
   which dwelt in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, in that inhabitation of the Spirit which was in
   him without measure, in any thing of those "all things" in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   the pre-eminence -- nothing in his love, condescension, grace, and
   mercy -- nothing in the work that he fulfilled, what he did and
   suffered in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> -- nothing in the benefits we receive thereby --
   nothing in the power and glory that he is exalted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> at the right
   hand of God -- but it is set forth in the Scripture and proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, that, believing in him, we may love him with all our hearts and
   souls. And, besides all this, that singular, that infinite effect of
   divine wisdom, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> there is nothing like in all the works of God,
   and with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> none of them may be compared -- namely, the constitution
   of his person by the union of his natures in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he becomes
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us the image of the invisible God, and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> all the blessed
   excellencies of his distinct natures are made most illustriously
   conspicuous in becoming one entire principle of all his mediatory
   operations on our behalf -- is proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us as the complete object
   of our faith and love. This is that person whose loveliness and beauty
   all the angels of God, all the holy ones above, do eternally admire and
   adore. In him are the infinite treasures of divine wisdom and goodness
   continually represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. This is he who is the joy, the
   delight, the love, the glory of the church below. "Thou whom our souls
   do love," is the title through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they know him and converse with him,
   <reference osisRef="Song.1.7">Song of Solomon 1:7</reference>; iii. 1, 4. This is he who is the Desire of all nations --
   the Beloved of God and men.
				</p><p>
   The mutual intercourse on this ground of love between Christ and the
   church, is the life and soul of the whole creation; for on the account
   of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> all things consist in him.
				</p><p>
   There is more glory under the eye of God, in the sighs, groans, and
   mournings of poor souls filled with the love of Christ, after the
   enjoyment of him according to his promises -- in their fervent prayers
   for his manifestation of himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them -- in the refreshments and
   unspeakable joys which they have in his gracious visits and embraces of
   his love -- than in the thrones and diadems of all the monarchs on the
   earth. Nor will they themselves part with the ineffable satisfactions
   which they have in these things, for all that this world can do for
   them or to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. "Mallem ruere cum Christo, quam regnare cum C�sare."
   These things have not only rendered prisons and dungeons more desirable
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them than the most goodly palaces, on future accounts, but have
   made them really places of such refreshment and joys as men shall seek
   in vain to extract out of all the comforts that this world can afford.

     O curv� in terras anim� et coelestium inanes!
				</p><p>
   Many there are who, not comprehending, not being affected with, that
   divine, spiritual description of the person of Christ which is given us
   by the Holy Ghost in the Scripture, do feign to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> themselves false
   representations of him by images and pictures, so as to excite carnal
   and corrupt affections in their minds. By the help of their outward
   senses, they reflect on their imaginations the shape of a human body,
   cast into postures and circumstances dolorous or triumphant; and so, by
   the working of their fancy, raise a commotion of mind in themselves,
   which they suppose to be love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ. But all these idols are
   teachers of lies. The true beauty and amiableness of the person of
   Christ, which is the formal object and cause of divine love, is so far
   from being represented in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, as that the mind is thereby wholly
   diverted from the contemplation of it. For no more can be so pictured
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us but what may belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a mere man, and what is arbitrarily
   referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, not by faith, but by corrupt imagination.
				</p><p>
   The beauty of the person of Christ, as represented in the Scripture,
   consists in things invisible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eyes of flesh. They are such as
   no hand of man can represent or shadow. It is the eye of faith alone
   that can see this King in his beauty. What else can contemplate on the
   untreated glories of his divine nature? Can the hand of man represent
   the union of his natures in the same person, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is peculiarly
   amiable? What eye can discern the mutual communications of the
   properties of his different natures in the same person, which depends
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> it is that God laid down his life for us, and purchased
   his church with his own blood? In these things, O vain man! does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the
   loveliness of the person of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of believers consist,
   and not in those strokes of art which fancy has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> guided a skilful hand
   and pencil to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. And what eye of flesh can discern the inhabitation of
   the Spirit in all fulness in the human nature? Can his condescension,
   his love, his grace, his power, his compassion, his offices, his
   fitness and ability to save sinners, be deciphered on a tablet, or
   engraven on wood or stone? However such pictures may be adorned,
   however beautified and enriched, they are not that Christ which the
   soul of the spouse does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> love; -- they are not any means of representing
   his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, or of conveying our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; -- they only
   divert the minds of superstitious persons from the Son of God, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   embraces of a cloud, composed of fancy and imagination.
				</p><p>
   Others there are who abhor these idols, and when they have so done,
   commit sacrilege. As they reject images, so they seem to do all love
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, distinct from other acts of obedience, as a
   fond imagination. But the most superstitious love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ -- that
   is, love acted in ways tainted with superstition -- is better than none
   at all. But with what eyes do such persons read the Scriptures? With
   what hearts do they consider them? What do they conceive is the
   intention of the Holy Ghost in all those descriptions which he gives us
   of the person of Christ as amiable and desirable above all things,
   making wherewithal a proposal of him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our affections -- inciting us
   to receive him by faith, and to cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in love? yea, to what
   end is our nature endued with this affection -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what end is the
   power of it renewed in us by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit --
   if it may not be fixed on this most proper and excellent object of it?
				</p><p>
   This is the foundation of our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ -- namely, the
   revelation and proposal of him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the Scripture as altogether
   lovely. The discovery that is made in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> of the glorious excellencies
   and endowments of his person -- of his love, his goodness, and grace --
   of his worth and work -- is that which engages<note n="engageth">Auto-modernized</note> the affections of
   believers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. It may be said, that if there be such a proposal of
   him made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all promiscuously, then all would equally discern his
   amiableness and be affected with it, who assent equally to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the truth
   of that revelation. But it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> always fallen out otherwise. In the
   days of his flesh, some that looked on him could see neither "form nor
   comeliness" in him therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he should be desired; others saw his glory
   -- "glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and
   truth." To some he is precious; to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others he is disallowed and
   rejected -- a stone which the builders refused, when others brought it
   forth, crying, "Grace, grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it!" as the head of the corner. Some
   can see nothing but weakness in him; to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others the wisdom and power
   of God do evidently shine forth in him. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> it must be said, that
   notwithstanding that open, plain representation that is made of him in
   the Scripture, unless the Holy Spirit gives us eyes to discern it, and
   circumcise our hearts by the cutting off corrupt prejudices and all
   effects of unbelief, implanting in them, by the efficacy of his grace,
   this blessed affection of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, all these things will make no
   impression on our minds.
				</p><p>
   As it was with the people on the giving of the law, notwithstanding all
   the great and mighty works which God had wrought among them, yet having
   not given them "a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear"
   -- which he affirms that he had not done, <reference osisRef="Deut.29.4">Deuteronomy 29:4</reference>, -- they were
   not moved to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faith or obedience by them; so is it in the preaching of
   the gospel. Notwithstanding all the blessed revelation that is made of
   the excellencies of the person of Christ in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, yet those into whose
   hearts God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not shine to give the knowledge of his glory in his
   face, can discern nothing of it, nor are their hearts affected with it.
				</p><p>
   We do not, therefore, in these things, follow "cunningly-devised
   fables." We do not indulge to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our own fancies and imaginations; --
   they are not unaccountable raptures or ecstasies which are pretended
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, nor such an artificial concatenation of thoughts as some ignorant
   of these things do boast that they can give an account of. Our love to
   Christ arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> alone from the revelation that is made of him in the
   Scripture -- is ingenerated, regulated, measured, and is to be judged
   thereby.

<title>Chapter 14 Motives to the Love of Christ. Themotives to this love of Christ is the last thing, on this head of our religious respect to him, that I shall speak to.</title>
<p>   When God required of the church the first and highest act of religion,
   the sole foundation of all others -- namely, to take him as their God,
   to own, believe, and trust in him alone as such, (which is wholly due
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for what he is, without any other consideration whatever,) --
   yet he thought meet to add a motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the performance of that duty
   from what he had done for them, <reference osisRef="Exod.20.2 Exod.20.3">Exodus 20:2-3</reference> The sense of the first
   command is, that we should take him alone for our God; for he is so,
   and there is no other. But in the prescription of this duty to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   church, he minds them of the benefits which they had received from him
   in bringing them out of the house of bondage.
				</p><p>
   God, in his wisdom and grace, orders<note n="ordereth">Auto-modernized</note> all the causes and reasons of
   our duty, so as that all the rational powers and faculties of our souls
   may be exercised in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not only propose himself
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, nor is Christ merely proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us as the proper object of
   our affections, but he calls us also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of all
   those things that may satisfy our souls that it is the most just,
   necessary, reasonable and advantageous course for us so to fix our
   affections an him.
				</p><p>
   And these considerations are taken from all that he did for us, with
   the reasons and grounds why he did it. We love him principally and
   ultimately for what he is; but nextly and immediately for what he did.
   What he did for us is first proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and it is that which our
   souls are first affected withal. For they are originally acted in all
   things by a sense of the want which they have, and a desire of the
   blessedness which they have not. This directs them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   done for sinners; but that leads immediately to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of
   what he is in himself. And when our love is fixed on him or his person,
   then all those things with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note>, from a sense of our own wants and
   desires, we were first affected, become motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the confirming and
   increasing of that love. This is the constant method of the Scripture;
   it first proposes to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us what the Lord Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done for us,
   especially in the discharge of his sacerdotal office, in his oblation
   and intercession, with the benefits which we receive thereby. Hereby it
   leads us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person, and presses<note n="presseth">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of all other
   things to engage our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. See <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5 Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8 Phil.2.9 Phil.2.10 Phil.2.11">Philippians 2:5-11</reference>, with <reference osisRef="Phil.3.8 Phil.3.9 Phil.3.10 Phil.3.11">Philippians 3:8-11</reference>
				</p><p>
   Motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the love of Christ are so great, so many, so diffused
   through the whole dispensation of God in him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, as that they can
   by no hand be fully expressed, let it be allowed ever so much to
   enlarge in the declaration of them; much less can they be represented
   in that short discourse of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> but a very small part is allotted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   their consideration -- such as ours is at present. The studying, the
   collection of them or so many of them as we are able, the meditation on
   them and improvement of them, are among the principal duties of our
   whole lives. What I shall offer is the reduction of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these two
   heads: 1. The acts of Christ, which is the substance of them; and, 2.
   The spring and fountain of those acts, which is the life of them.
				</p><p>
   1. In general they are all the acts of his mediatory office, with all
   the fruits of them, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we are made partners. There is not any
   thing that he did or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>, in the discharge of his mediatory office,
   from the first susception of it in his incarnation in the womb of the
   blessed Virgin to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his present intercession in heaven, but is an
   effectual motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the love of him; and as such is proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us
   in the Scripture. Whatever he did or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> with or towards us in the
   name of God, as the king and prophet of the church -- whatever he did
   or does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> with God for us, as our high priest -- it all speaks this
   language in the hearts of them that believe: O love the Lord Jesus in
   sincerity.
				</p><p>
   The consideration of what Christ thus did and does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> for us is
   inseparable from that of the benefits which we receive thereby. A due
   mixture of both these -- of what he did for us, and what we obtain
   thereby -- comprises<note n="compriseth">Auto-modernized</note> the substance of these motives: "Who loved me,
   and gave himself for me" -- "Who loved us, and washed us in his own
   blood, and made us kings and priests to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God" -- "For thou wast slain,
   and hast bought us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God with thy blood." And both these are of a
   transcendent nature, requiring our love to be so also. Who is able to
   comprehend the glory of the mediatory acting of the Son of God, in the
   assumption of our nature -- in what he did and suffered in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>? And
   for us, eye has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not seen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the
   heart of man to conceive, what we receive thereby. The least benefit,
   and that obtained by the least expense of trouble or charge, deserves<note n="deserveth">Auto-modernized</note>
   love, and leaves<note n="leaveth">Auto-modernized</note> the brand of a crime where it is not so entertained.
   What, then, do the greatest deserve, and thou procured by the greatest
   expense -- even the price of the blood of the Son of God?
				</p><p>
   If we have any faith concerning these things, it will produce love, as
   that love will obedience. Whatever we profess concerning them, it
   springs from tradition and opinion, and not from faith, if it engage
   not our souls into the love of him. The frame of heart which ensues on
   the real faith of these things is expressed, <reference osisRef="Ps.103.1 Ps.103.2 Ps.103.3 Ps.103.4 Ps.103.5">Psalms 103:1-5</reference>, "Bless the
   Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless
   the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits; who forgives<note n="forgiveth">Auto-modernized</note> all
   thine iniquities; who heals<note n="healeth">Auto-modernized</note> all thy diseases; who redeems<note n="redeemeth">Auto-modernized</note> thy life
   from destruction; who crowns<note n="crowneth">Auto-modernized</note> thee with lovingkindness and tender
   mercies; who satisfies<note n="satisfieth">Auto-modernized</note> thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
   is renewed like the eagle's." Let men pretend what they will, there
   needs no greater, no other evidence, to prove that any one does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   really believe the things that are reported in the Gospel, concerning
   the mediatory acting of Christ, or that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no experience in his
   own soul and conscience of the fruits and effects of them, than this --
   that his heart is not engaged by them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the most ardent love towards
   his person.
				</p><p>
   He is no Christian who lives not much in the meditation of the
   mediation of Christ, and the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> acts of it. Some may more abound
   in that work than others, as it is fixed, formed and regular; some may
   be more able than others to dispose their thought concerning them into
   method and order; some may be more diligent than others in the
   observation of times for the solemn performance of this duty; some may
   be able to rise to higher and clearer apprehensions of them than
   others. But as for those, the bent of whose minds does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not lie towards
   thoughts of them -- whose hearts are not on all occasions retreating
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the remembrance of them -- who embrace not all opportunities to
   call them over as they are able -- on what grounds can they be esteemed
   Christians? how do they live by the faith of the Son of God? Are the
   great things of the Gospel, of the mediation of Christ, proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, as those which we may think of when we have nothing else to do,
   that we may meditate upon or neglect at our pleasure -- as those
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> is so small as that they must give place to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   all other occasions or diversions whatever? Nay; if our minds are not
   filled with these things -- if Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not dwell plentifully in our
   hearts by faith -- if our souls are not possessed with them, and in
   their whole inward frame and constitution so cut into this mould as to
   be led by a natural complacency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a converse with them -- we are
   strangers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the life of faith. And if we are thus conversant about
   these things, they will engage our hearts into the love of the person
   of Christ. To suppose the contrary, is indeed to deny the truth and
   reality of them all, and to turn the Gospel into a fable.
				</p><p>
   Take one instance from among the rest -- namely, his death. Has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> he the
   heart of a Christian, who does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not often meditate on the death of his
   Saviour, who does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not derive his life from it? Who can look into the
   Gospel and not fix on those lines which either immediately and
   directly, or through some other paths of divine grace and wisdom, do
   lead him to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>? And can any have believing thoughts concerning the
   death of Christ, and not have his heart affected with ardent love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his person? Christ in the Gospel "is evidently set forth, crucified"
   before us. Can any by the eye of faith look on this bleeding, dying
   Redeemer, and suppose love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person to be nothing but the work
   of fancy or imagination? They know the contrary, who "always bear about
   in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus," as the apostle speaks, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.10">2 Corinthians 4:10</reference> As his whole "name," in all that he did, is "as ointment poured
   forth," for which "the virgins love him," <reference osisRef="Song.1.3">Song of Solomon 1:3</reference>, -- so this
   precious perfume of his death is that with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> their hearts are
   ravished in a peculiar manner.
				</p><p>
   Again: as there can be no faith in Christ where there is no love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him on the account of his mediatory acts; so, where it is not, the want
   of it casts<note n="casteth">Auto-modernized</note> persons under the highest guilt of ingratitude that our
   nature is liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. The highest aggravation of the sin of angels was
   their ingratitude to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their Maker. For whereas, by his mere will and
   pleasure, they were stated in the highest excellency, pre-eminence, and
   dignity, that he thought good to communicate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any creatures -- or,
   it may be, that any mere created nature is capable of in itself -- they
   were unthankful for what they had so received from undeserved goodness
   and bounty; and so cast themselves into everlasting ruin. But yet the
   sin of men, in their ingratitude towards Christ on the account of what
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done for them, is attended with an aggravation above that of
   the angels. For although the angels were originally instated in that
   condition of dignity which in this world we cannot attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, yet
   were they not redeemed and recovered from misery as we are.
				</p><p>
   In all the crowd of evil and wicked men that the world is pestered
   withal, there are none, by common consent, so stigmatised for unworthy
   villainy, as those who are signally ungrateful for singular benefits.
   If persons are unthankful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, if they have not the highest love
   for them, who redeem them from ignominy and death, and instate them in
   a plentiful inheritance, (if any such instances may be given,) and that
   with the greatest expense of labour and charge, -- mankind, without any
   regret, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> tacitly condemn them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> greater miseries than those
   which they were delivered from. What, then, will be the condition of
   them whose hearts are not so affected with the mediation of Christ and
   the fruits of it, as to engage the best, the choicest of their
   affections to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him! The gospel itself will be "a savour of death" to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   such ungrateful wretches.
				</p><p>
   2. That which the Scripture principally insists<note n="insisteth">Auto-modernized</note> on as the motive of
   our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, is his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- which was the principle of
   all his mediatory actings in our behalf.
				</p><p>
   Love is that jewel of human nature which commands a valuation wherever
   it is found. Let other circumstances be what they will, whatever
   distances between persons may be made by them, yet real love, where it
   is evidenced so to be, is not despised by any but such as degenerate
   into profligate brutality. If it be so stated as that it can produce no
   outward effects advantageous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that are beloved, yet it
   commands a respect, as it were, whether we will or no, and some return
   in its own kind. Especially it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so if it be altogether undeserved,
   and so evidences<note n="evidenceth">Auto-modernized</note> itself to proceed from a goodness of nature, and an
   inclination to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the good of them on whom it is fixed. For, whereas the
   essential nature of love consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in willing good to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them that are
   beloved -- where the act of the will is real, sincere, and constantly
   exercised, without any defect of it on our part, no restraints can
   possibly be put upon our minds from going out in some acts of love
   again upon its account, unless all their faculties are utterly depraved
   by habits of brutish and filthy lusts. But when this love, which is
   thus undeserved, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> also abound in effects troublesome and chargeable
   in them in whom it is, and highly beneficial to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them on whom it is
   placed -- if there be any such affection left in the nature of any man,
   it will prevail to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a reciprocal love. And all these things are found
   in the love of Christ, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that degree and height as nothing parallel
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it can be found in the whole creation. I shall briefly speak of it
   under two general heads.
				</p><p>
   (1.) The sole spring of all the mediatory acting of Christ, both in the
   susception of our nature and in all that he did and suffered in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>,
   was his own mere love and grace, working by pity and compassion. It is
   true, he undertook this work principally with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of
   God, and out of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. But with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, his only
   motive to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it was his abundant, overflowing love. And this is
   especially remembered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in that instance in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it carried him
   through the greatest difficulties -- namely, in his death and the
   oblation of himself on our behalf, <reference osisRef="Gal.2.20">Galatians 2:20</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.5.2 Eph.5.25 Eph.5.26">Ephesians 5:2, 25-26</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.3.16">1 John 3:16</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rev.1.5 Rev.1.6">Revelation of John 1:5-6</reference> This alone inclined the Son of God to
   undertake the glorious work of our redemption, and carried him through
   the death and dread which he underwent in the accomplishment of it.
				</p><p>
   Should I engage into the consideration of this love of Christ, which
   was the great means of conveying all the effects of divine wisdom and
   grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, -- that glass which God chose to represent
   himself and all his goodness in to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> believers, -- that spirit of life
   in the wheel of all the motions of the person of Christ in the
   redemption of the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal glory of God, his own and
   that of his redeemed also, -- that mirror in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the holy angels and
   blessed saints shall for ever contemplate the divine excellencies in
   their suitable operations; -- I must now begin a discourse much larger
   than that which I have passed through. But it is not suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> my
   present design so to do. For, considering the growing apprehensions of
   many about the person of Christ, which are utterly destructive of the
   whole nature of that love which we ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, do I know how soon
   a more distinct explication and defence of it may be called for. And
   this cause will not be forsaken.
				</p><p>
   They know nothing of the life and power of the gospel, nothing of the
   reality of the grace of God, nor do they believe aright one article of
   the Christian faith, whose hearts are not sensible of the love of
   Christ in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>; nor is he sensible of the love of Christ, whose
   affections are not upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> drawn out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. I say, they make a
   pageant of religion, -- a fable for the theatre of the world, -- a
   business of fancy and opinion, -- whose hearts are not really affected
   with the love of Christ, in the susception and discharge of the work of
   mediation, so as to have real and spiritually sensible affections for
   him. Men may babble things which they have learned by rote; they have
   no real acquaintance with Christianity, who imagine that the placing of
   the most intense affections of our souls on the person of Christ -- the
   loving him with all our hearts because of his love -- our being
   overcome thereby until we are sick of love -- the constant motions of
   our souls towards him with delight and adherence -- are but fancies and
   imaginations. I renounce that religion, be it whose it will, that
   teaches<note n="teacheth">Auto-modernized</note>, insinuates<note n="insinuateth">Auto-modernized</note>, or gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> countenance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, such abominations.
   That doctrine is as discrepant from the Gospel as the Alkoran -- as
   contrary to the experience of believers as what is acted in and by the
   devils which instructs men to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a contempt of the most fervent love
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, or casts reflections upon it. I had rather choose my
   eternal lot and portion with the meanest believer, who, being
   effectually sensible of the love of Christ, spends his days in mourning
   that he can love him no more than he finds himself on his utmost
   endeavours for the discharge of his duty to do, than with the best of
   them, whose vain speculations and a false pretence of reason puff them
   up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a contempt of these things.
				</p><p>
   (2.) This love of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church is singular in all those
   qualifications which render love obliging to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> reciprocal affections.
   It is so in its reality. There can be no love amongst men, but will
   derive something from that disorder which is in their affections in
   their highest actings. But the love of Christ is pure and absolutely
   free from any alloy. There cannot be the least suspicion of anything of
   self in it. And it is absolutely undeserved. Nothing can be found
   amongst men that can represent or exemplify its freedom from any desert
   on our part. The most candid and ingenuous love amongst us is, when we
   love another for his worth, excellency, and usefulness, though we have
   no singular benefit of them ourselves; but not the least of any of
   these things were found in them on whom he set his love, until they
   were wrought in them, as effects of that love which he set upon them.
				</p><p>
   Men sometimes may rise up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> such a high degree and instance in love,
   as that they will even die for one another; but then it must be on a
   superlative esteem which they have of their worth and merit. It may be,
   says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle, treating of the love of Christ, and of God in him,
   that "for a good man some would even dare to die," <reference osisRef="Rom.5.7">Romans 5:7</reference> It must
   be for a good man -- one who is justly esteemed "commune bonum," a
   public good to mankind -- one whose benignity is ready to exercise
   loving-kindness on all occasions, which is the estate of a good man; --
   peradventure some would even dare to die for such a man. This is the
   height of what love among men can rise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; and if it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   instanced in any, it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been accompanied with an open mixture of
   vain-glory and desire of renown. But the Lord Christ placed his love on
   us, that love from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he died for us, when we were sinners and
   ungodly; that is, every thing which might render us unamiable and
   undeserving. Though we were as deformed as sin could render us, and
   more deeply indebted than the whole creation could pay or answer, yet
   did he fix his love upon us, to free us from that condition, and to
   render us meet for the most intimate society with himself. Never was
   there love which had such effects -- which cost him so dear in whom it
   was, and proved so advantageous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them on whom it was placed. In the
   pursuit of it he underwent everything that is evil in his own person,
   and we receive everything that is good in the favour of God and eternal
   blessedness.
				</p><p>
   On the account of these things, the apostle ascribes a constraining
   power to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the love of Christ, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.14">2 Corinthians 5:14</reference> And if it constrains us
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that of love in the first
   place. For no suitable return can be made for love but love, at least
   not without it. As love cannot be purchased -- "For if a man would give
   all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be
   condemned," <reference osisRef="Song.8.7">Song of Solomon 8:7</reference>, -- so if a man would give all the world for
   a requital of love, without love it would be despised. To fancy that
   all the love of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us consists in the precepts and promises of
   the Gospel, and all our love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in the observance of his
   commands, without a real love in him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our persons, like that of a
   "husband to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a wife," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.25 Eph.5.26">Ephesians 5:25-26</reference>, or a holy affection in our
   hearts and minds to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his person, is to overthrow the whole power of
   religion -- to despoil it of its life and soul, leaving nothing but the
   carcass of it.
				</p><p>
   This love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in him, because of his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, is the principal instance of divine love, the touchstone of its
   reality and sincerity. Whatever men may boast of their affectionate
   endearments to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine goodness, if it be not founded in a sense
   of this love of Christ, and the love of God in him, they are but empty
   notions they nourish withal, and their deceived hearts feed upon ashes.
   It is in Christ alone that God is declared to be love; without an
   apprehension of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> none can love him as they ought. In him alone that
   infinite goodness, which is the peculiar object of divine love, is
   truly represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, without any such deceiving phantasm as the
   workings of fancy or depravation of reason may impose upon us. And on
   him does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the saving communication of all the effects of it depend. And
   an infinite condescension is it in the holy God, so to express his
   "glory in the face of Jesus Christ," or to propose himself as the
   object of our love in and through him. For considering our weakness as
   to an immediate comprehension of the infinite excellencies of the
   divine nature, or to bear the rays of his resplendent glory, seeing
   none can see his face and live, it is the most adorable effect of
   divine wisdom and grace, that we are admitted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the contemplation of
   them in the person of Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   There is yet farther evidence to be given of this love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person
   of Christ, from all those blessed effects of it which are declared in
   the Scripture, and of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> believers have the experience in themselves.
   But something I have spoken concerning them formerly, in my discourse
   about communion with God; and the nature of the present design will not
   admit of enlargement upon them.
</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 15 Conformity to Christ and Following his Example">
<title>Chapter 15 Conformity to Christ, and Following his Example.</title>
<p>   III. The third thing proposed to declare the use of the person of
   Christ in religion, is that conformity which is required of us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him. This is the great design and projection of all believers. Every
   one of them has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the idea or image of Christ in his mind, in the eye of
   faith, as it is represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in the glass of the Gospel: Ten
   doxan Kuriou katoptrizomenoi k. t. l., <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> We behold his
   glory "in a glass," which implants the image of it on our minds. And
   hereby the mind is transformed into the same image, made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ so represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- which is the conformity we speak of.
   Hence every true believer has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> his heart under the conduct of an
   habitual inclination and desire to be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ. And it were
   easy to demonstrate, that where this is not, there is neither faith nor
   love. Faith will cast the soul into the form or frame of the thing
   believed, <reference osisRef="Rom.6.17">Romans 6:17</reference> And all sincere love works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> an assimilation.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the best evidence of a real principle of the life of God in
   any soul -- of the sincerity of faith, love, and obedience -- is an
   internal cordial endeavour, operative on all occasions, after
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   There are two parts of the duty proposed. The first respects the
   internal grace and holiness of the human nature of Christ; the other,
   his example in duties of obedience. And both of them -- both materially
   as to the things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they consist, and formally as they were his or
   in him -- belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the constitution of a true disciple.
				</p><p>
   In the first place, Internal conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his habitual grace and
   holiness is the fundamental design of a Christian life. That which is
   the best without it is a pretended imitation of his example in outward
   duties of obedience. I call it pretended, because where the first
   design is wanting, it is no more but so; nor is it acceptable to Christ
   nor approved by him. And therefore an attempt to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> often
   issued in formality, hypocrisy, and superstition. I shall therefore lay
   down the grounds of this design, the nature of it, and the means of its
   pursuit.
				</p><p>
   1. God, in the human nature of Christ, did perfectly renew that blessed
   image of his on our nature which we lost in Adam, with an addition of
   many glorious endowments which Adam was not made partaker of. God did
   not renew it in his nature as though that portion of it of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> he was
   partaker had ever been destitute or deprived of it, as it is with the
   same nature in all other persons. For he derived not his nature from
   Adam in the same way that we do; nor was he ever in Adam as the public
   representative of our nature, as we were. But our nature in him had the
   image of God implanted in it, which was lost and separated from the
   same nature in all other instances of its subsistence. "It pleased the
   Father that in him should all fulness dwell," -- that he should be
   "full of grace and truth," and "in all things have the pre-eminence."
   But of these gracious endowments of the human nature of Christ I have
   discoursed elsewhere.
				</p><p>
   2. One end of God in filling the human nature of Christ with all grace,
   in implanting his glorious image upon it, was, that he might in him
   propose an example of what he would by the same grace renew us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>,
   and what we ought in a way of duty to labour after. The fulness of
   grace was necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human nature of Christ, from its
   hypostatical union with the Son of God. For whereas in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   "fulness of the godhead dwelt in him bodily," it became to hagion, a
   "holy thing," <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference> It was also necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   own obedience in the flesh, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he fulfilled all righteousness,
   "did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.22">1 Peter 2:22</reference> And
   it was so to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the discharge of the office he undertook; for "such an
   high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate
   from sinners," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26">Hebrews 7:26</reference> Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, the infinite wisdom of God had
   this farther design in it also, -- namely, that he might be the pattern
   and example of the renovation of the image of God in us, and of the
   glory that does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> ensue upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. He is in the eye of God as the idea of
   what he intends in us, in the communication of grace and glory; and he
   ought to be so in ours, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all that we aim at in a way of duty.
				</p><p>
   He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> "predestinated us to be conformed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the image of his Son,
   that he might be the first-born among many brethren," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.29">Romans 8:29</reference> In
   the collation of all grace on Christ, God designed to make him "the
   first born of many brethren;" that is, not only to give him the power
   and authority of the firstborn, with the trust of the whole inheritance
   to be communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, but also as the example of what he would
   bring them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. "For both he that sanctifies<note n="sanctifieth">Auto-modernized</note> and they that are
   sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call
   them brethren," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.11">Hebrews 2:11</reference> It is Christ who sanctifies<note n="sanctifieth">Auto-modernized</note> believers;
   yet is it from God, who first sanctified him, that he and they might be
   of one, and so become brethren, as bearing the image of the same
   Father. God designed and gave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ grace and glory; and he did
   it that he might be the prototype of what he designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and
   would bestow upon us. Hence the apostle shows that the effect of this
   predestination to conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the image of the Son is the
   communication of all effectual, saving grace, with the glory that
   ensues upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.30">Romans 8:30</reference>, "Moreover, whom he did predestinate,
   them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and
   whom he justified, them he also glorified."
				</p><p>
   The great design of God in his grace is, that as we have borne the
   "image of the first Adam" in the depravation of our natures, so we
   should bear the "image of the second" in their renovation. "As we have
   borne the image of the earthy," so "we shall bear the image of the
   heavenly," <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.49">1 Corinthians 15:49</reference> And as he is the pattern of all our graces,
   so he is of glory also. All our glory will consist in our being "made
   like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him;" which, what it is, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not as yet appear, <reference osisRef="1John.3.2">1 John 3:2</reference> For "he shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his glorious body," <reference osisRef="Phil.3.21">Philippians 3:21</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the fulness of grace
   was bestowed on the human nature of Christ, and the image of God
   gloriously implanted upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, that it might be the prototype and
   example of what the church was through him to be made partaker of. That
   which God intends for us in the internal communication of his grace,
   and in the use of all the ordinances of the church, is, that we may
   come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the "measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ," <reference osisRef="Eph.4.13">Ephesians 4:13</reference> There is a fulness of all grace in Christ. To this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> are we to
   be brought, according to the measure that is designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every one of
   us. "For to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every one of us is given grace, according to the measure
   of the gift of Christ," verse 7. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>, in his sovereign grace,
   assigned different measures to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those on whom he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> bestow it. And
   therefore it is called "the stature", because as we grow gradually to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it, as men do to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their just stature; so there is a variety in what we
   attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, as there is in the statures of men, who are yet all
   perfect in their proportion.
				</p><p>
   3. This image of God in Christ is represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the Gospel.
   Being lost from our nature, it was utterly impossible we should have
   any just comprehension of it. There could be no steady notion of the
   image of God, until it was renewed and exemplified in the human nature
   of Christ. And upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, without the knowledge of him, the wisest of men
   have taken those things to render men most like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God which were
   adverse to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Such were the most of those things which the heathens
   adored as heroic virtues. But being perfectly exemplified in Christ, it
   is now plainly represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the Gospel. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> with open
   face we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, and are changed
   into the same image, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> The veil being taken away from
   divine revelations by the doctrine of the Gospel and from our hearts
   "by the Lord the Spirit," we behold the image of God in Christ with
   open face, which is the principal means of our being transformed into
   it. The Gospel is the declaration of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and the glory of
   God in him; as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> many other ends, so in special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>, that we might in
   him behold and contemplate that image of God we are gradually to be
   renewed into. Hence, we are so in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> to learn the truth as it is in
   Jesus, as to be "renewed in the spirit of our mind," and to "put on the
   new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
   holiness," <reference osisRef="Eph.4.20 Eph.4.23 Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:20, 23-24</reference> -- that is, "renewed after the image of
   him who created him," <reference osisRef="Col.3.10">Colossians 3:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   4. It is, therefore, evident that the life of God in us consists in
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ; nor is the Holy Spirit, as the principal and
   efficient cause of it, given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us for any other end but to unite us
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and make us like him. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the original Gospel duty,
   which animates and rectifies all others, is a design for conformity
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ in all the gracious principles and qualifications of his
   holy soul, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the image of God in him does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist. As he is the
   prototype and exemplar in the eye of God for the communication of all
   grace to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, so he ought to be the great example in the eye of our
   faith in all our obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, in our compliance with all that he
   requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> of us.
				</p><p>
   God himself, or the divine nature in its holy perfections, is the
   ultimate object and idea of our transformation in the renewing of our
   minds. And, therefore, under the Old Testament, before the incarnation
   of the Son, he proposed his own holiness immediately as the pattern of
   the church: "Be ye holy, for the Lord your God is holy," <reference osisRef="Lev.11.44">Leviticus 11:44</reference>;
   xix. 2; xx. 26. But the law made nothing perfect. For to complete this
   great injunction, there was yet wanting an express example of the
   holiness required; which is not given us but in him who is "the
   first-born, the image of the invisible God."
				</p><p>
   There was a notion, even among the philosophers, that the principal
   endeavour of a wise man was to be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. But in the improvement
   of it, the best of them fell into foolish and proud imaginations.
   Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, the notion itself was the principal beam of our primigenial
   light, the best relic of our natural perfections; and those who are not
   some way under the power of a design to be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God are every way
   like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the devil. But those persons who had nothing but the absolute
   essential properties of the divine nature to contemplate on in the
   light of reason, failed all of them, both in the notion itself of
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and especially in the practical improvement of it.
   Whatever men may fancy to the contrary, it is the design of the
   apostle, in sundry places of his writings, to prove that they did so,
   especially Rom. i.; 1 Cor. i.. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it was an infinite
   condescension of divine wisdom and grace, gloriously to implant that
   image of him which we are to endeavour conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in the human
   nature of Christ, and then so fully to represent and propose it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us
   in the revelation of the Gospel.
				</p><p>
   The infinite perfections of God, considered absolutely in themselves,
   are accompanied with such an incomprehensible glory as it is hard to
   conceive how they are the object of our imitation. But the
   representation that is made of them in Christ, as the image of the
   invisible God, is so suited to the renewed faculties of our souls, so
   congenial to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the new creature or the gracious principle of spiritual
   life in us, that the mind can dwell on the contemplation of them, and
   be thereby transformed into the same image.
				</p><p>
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> lies much of the life and power of Christian religion, as it
   resides in the souls of men. This is the prevailing design of the minds
   of them that truly believe the Gospel; they would in all things be like
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Jesus Christ. And I shall briefly show -- (1.) What is required
   to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; and, (2.) What is to be done in a way of duty for the
   attaining that end.
				</p><p>
   (1.) A spiritual light, to discern the beauty, glory, and amiableness
   of grace in Christ, is required to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. We can have no real design of
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, unless we have their eyes who "beheld his glory,
   the glory of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth,"
   <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference> Nor is it enough that we seem to discern the glory of his
   person, unless we see a beauty and excellency in every grace that is in
   him. "Learn of me," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he; "for I am meek and lowly in heart," <reference osisRef="Matt.11.29">Matthew 11:29</reference> If we are not able to discern an excellency in meekness and
   lowliness of heart, (as they are things generally despised,) how shall
   we sincerely endeavour after conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ in them? The like
   may be said of all his other gracious qualifications. His zeal, his
   patience, his self-denial, his readiness for the cross, his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his enemies, his benignity to all mankind, his faith and fervency in
   prayer, his love to God, his compassion towards the souls of men, his
   unweariedness in doing good, his purity, his universal holiness; --
   unless we have a spiritual light to discern the glory and amiableness
   of them all, as they were in him, we speak in vain of any design for
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And this we have not, unless God shine into our
   hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face
   of Jesus Christ. It is, I say, a foolish thing to talk of the imitation
   of Christ, whilst really, through the darkness of our minds, we discern
   not that there is an excellency in the things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we ought to be
   like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them so discovered in a beam of heavenly light, is
   required to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same end. No soul can have a design of conformity
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ but his who so likes and loves the graces that were in him,
   as to esteem a participation of them in their power to be the greatest
   advantage, to be the most invaluable privilege, that can in this world
   be attained. It is the savour of his good ointments for which the
   virgins love him, cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and endeavour to be like him. In
   that of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we now discourse -- namely, of conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- he
   is the representative of the image of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. And, if we do not
   love and prize above all things those gracious qualifications and
   dispositions of mind in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist, whatever we may pretend
   of the imitation of Christ in any outward acts or duties of obedience,
   we have no design of conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. He who sees and admires the
   glory of Christ as filled with these graces -- as he "was fairer than
   the children of men," because "grace was poured into his lips" -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   whom nothing is so desirable as to have the same mind, the same heart,
   the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus -- is prepared to press after
   conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> such a soul the representation of all
   these excellencies in the person of Christ is the great incentive,
   motive, and guide, in and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all internal obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
				</p><p>
   Lastly, That in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we are to labour for this conformity may be
   reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> two heads.
				</p><p>
   [1.] An opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all sin, in the root, principle, and most
   secret springs of it, or original cleavings to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our nature. He "did no
   sin, neither was there any guile found in his mouth." He "was holy,
   harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners." He was the "Lamb of God,
   without spot or blemish;" like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, yet without sin. Not the least
   tincture of sin did ever make an approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his holy nature. He was
   absolutely free from every drop of that fomes which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> invaded us in
   our depraved condition. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, to be freed from all sin, is the
   first general part of an endeavour for conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ. And
   although we cannot perfectly attain to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> in this life, as we have
   "not already attained, nor are already perfect," yet he who groans<note n="groaneth">Auto-modernized</note>
   not in himself after it -- who does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not loathe every thing that is of
   the remainder of sin in him and himself for it -- who does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not labour
   after its absolute and universal extirpation -- has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no sincere design
   of conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, nor can so have. He who endeavours to be
   like him, must "purify himself, even as he is pure." Thoughts of the
   purity of Christ, in his absolute freedom from the least tincture of
   sin, will not suffer a believer to be negligent, at any time, for the
   endeavouring the utter ruin of that which makes him unlike to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
   And it is a blessed advantage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faith, in the work of mortification
   of sin, that we have such a pattern continually before us.
				</p><p>
   [2.] The due improvement of, and continual growth, in every grace, is
   the other general part of this duty. In the exercise of his own
   all-fulness of grace, both in moral duties of obedience and the
   special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> duties of his office, did the glory of Christ on the earth
   consist. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, to abound in the exercise of every grace -- to grow
   in the root and thrive in the fruit of them -- is to be conformed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the image of the Son of God.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, The following the example of Christ in all duties towards God
   and men, in his whole conversation on the earth, is the second part of
   the instance now given concerning the use of the person of Christ in
   religion. The field is large which here lies before us, and filled with
   numberless blessed instances. I cannot here enter into it; and the
   mistakes that have been in a pretence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, require that it should
   be handled distinctly and at large by itself; which, if God will, may
   be done in due time. One or two general instances in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was most
   eminently our example, shall close this discourse.
				</p><p>
   1. His meekness, lowliness of mind, condescension to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all sorts of
   persons -- his love and kindness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mankind -- his readiness to do
   good to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all, with patience and forbearance -- are continually set
   before us in his example. I place them all under one head, as
   proceeding all from the same spring of divine goodness, and having
   effects of the same nature. With respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, it is required that
   "the same mind be in us that was in Christ Jesus," <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5">Philippians 2:5</reference>; and
   that we "walk in love, as he also loved us," <reference osisRef="Eph.5.2">Ephesians 5:2</reference>
				</p><p>
   In these things was he the great representative of the divine goodness
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. In the acting of these graces on all occasions did he declare
   and manifest the nature of God, from whom he came. And this was one end
   of his exhibition in the flesh. Sin had filled the world with a
   representation of the devil and his nature, in mutual hatred, strife,
   variance, envy, wrath, pride, fierceness, and rage, against one
   another; all which are of the old murderer. The instances of a cured,
   of a contrary frame, were obscure and weak in the best of the saints of
   old. But in our Lord Jesus the light of the glory of God in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> first
   shone upon the world. In the exercise of these graces, which he most
   abounded in, because the sins, weaknesses and infirmities of men gave
   continual occasion to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, did he represent the divine nature as
   love -- as infinitely good, benign, merciful, and patient -- delighting
   in the exercise of these its holy properties. In them was the Lord
   Christ our example in a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner. And they do in vain pretend
   to be his disciples, to be followers of him, who endeavour not to order
   the whole course of their lives in conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in these things.
				</p><p>
   One Christian who is meek, humble, kind, patient, and useful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all;
   that condescends to the ignorance, weaknesses and infirmities of
   others; that passes<note n="passeth">Auto-modernized</note> by provocations, injuries, contempt, with patience
   and with silence, unless where the glory and truth of God call for a
   just vindication; that pities<note n="pitieth">Auto-modernized</note> all sorts of men in their failings and
   miscarriages, who is free from jealousies and evil surmises; that
   loves<note n="loveth">Auto-modernized</note> what is good in all men, and all men even in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are not
   good, nor do good, -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> more express the virtues and excellencies of
   Christ than thousands can do with the most magnificent works of piety
   or charity, where this frame is wanting in them. For men to pretend to
   follow the example of Christ, and in the meantime to be proud, wrathful
   envious, bitterly zealous, calling for fire from heaven to destroy men,
   or fetching it themselves from hell, is to cry, "Hail to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him," and to
   crucify him afresh to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their power.
				</p><p>
   2. Self-denial, readiness for the cross, with patience in sufferings,
   are the second sort of things which he calls all his disciples to
   follow his example in. It is the fundamental law of his Gospel, that if
   any one will be his disciple, "he must deny himself, take up his cross,
   and follow him." These things in him, as they are all of them summarily
   represented, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.5 Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:5-8</reference>, by reason of the glory of his person and
   the nature of his sufferings, are quite of another kind than that we
   are called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. But his grace in them all is our only pattern in what
   is required of us. "Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
   that we should follow his steps: who, when he was reviled, reviled not
   again; when he suffered, he threatened not," <reference osisRef="1Pet.2.21 1Pet.2.22 1Pet.2.23">1 Peter 2:21-23</reference> Hence
   are we called to look to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> "Jesus, the author and finisher of our
   faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, and
   despised the shame." For we are to "consider him, who endured such
   contradiction of sinners against himself," that we faint not, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.3">Hebrews 12:3</reference> Blessed be God for this example -- for the glory of the
   condescension, patience, faith, and endurance, of Jesus Christ, in the
   extremity of all sorts of sufferings. This has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been the pole-star of
   the church in all its storms; the guide, the comfort, support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note> and
   encouragement of all those holy souls, who, in their several
   generations, have in various degrees undergone persecution for
   righteousness' sake; and yet continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> so to be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them who are in
   the same condition.
				</p><p>
   And I must say, as I have done on some other occasions in the handling
   of this subject, that a discourse on this one instance of the use of
   Christ in religion -- from the consideration of the person who
   suffered, and set us this example; of the principle from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>, and
   the end for which, he did it; of the variety of evils of all sorts he
   had to conflict withal; of his invincible patience under them all, and
   immovableness of love and compassion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mankind, even his
   persecutors; the dolorous afflictive circumstances of his sufferings
   from God and men; the blessed efficacious workings of his faith and
   trust in God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the uttermost; with the glorious issue of the whole,
   and the influence of all these considerations to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consolation and
   support<note n="supportment">Auto-modernized</note> of the church -- would take up more room and time than what
   is allotted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole of that of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> it is here the least part. I
   shall leave the whole under the shade of that blessed promise, "If so
   be that we suffer with him, we may be also glorified together; for I
   reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
   compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.17 Rom.8.18">Romans 8:17-18</reference>
				</p><p>
   IV. The last thing proposed concerning the person of Christ, was the
   use of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> believers, in the whole of their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God and
   duty towards him. And the things belonging to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> may be reduced
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these general heads: 
				</p><p>
   1. Their sanctification, which consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note> in these four things: (1.)
   The mortification of sin, (2.) The gradual renovation of our natures,
   (3.) Assistances in actual obedience, (4.) The same in temptations and
   trials.
				</p><p>
   2. Their justification, with its concomitants and consequent; as --
   (1.) Adoption, (2.) Peace, (3.) Consolation and joy in life and death,
   (4.) Spiritual gifts, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the edification of themselves and others,
   (5.) A blessed resurrection, (6.) Eternal glory.
				</p><p>
   There are other things which also belong to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>: -- as their guidance
   in the course of their conversation in this world, direction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   usefulness in all states and conditions, patient waiting for the
   accomplishment of God's promises to the church, the communication of
   federal blessings to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their families, and the exercise of
   loving-kindness towards mankind in general, with sundry other
   concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of the life of faith of the like importance; but they may
   be all reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the general heads proposed.
				</p><p>
   What should have been spoken with reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these things belongs
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these three heads: 
				</p><p>
   1^st, A declaration that all these things are wrought in and
   communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> believers, according to their various natures, by an
   emanation of grace and power from the person of Jesus Christ, as the
   head of the church -- as he who is exalted and made a Prince and a
   Saviour, to give repentance and the forgiveness of sins.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, A declaration of the way and manner how believers do live upon
   Christ in the exercise of faith, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>, according to the promise and
   appointment of God, they derive from him the whole grace and mercy
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> in this world they are made partakers, and are established in
   the expectation of what they shall receive hereafter by his power. And
   that two things do hence ensue: (1^st,) The necessity of universal
   evangelical obedience, seeing it is only in and by the duties of it
   that faith is, or can be, kept in a due exercise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ends
   mentioned. (2^dly,) That believers do hereby increase continually with
   the increase of God, and grow up into him who is the head, until they
   become the fulness of him who fills all in all.
				</p><p>
   3^dly, A conviction that a real interest in, and participation of,
   these things cannot be obtained any other way but by the actual
   exercise of faith on the person of Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   These things were necessary to be handled at large with reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the end proposed. But, for sundry reasons, the whole of this labour is
   here declined. For some of the particulars mentioned I have already
   insisted on in other discourses heretofore published, and that with
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end here designed. And this argument cannot be handled
   as it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> deserve, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> full satisfaction, without an entire discourse
   concerning the life of faith; which my present design will not admit
   of.

<title>Chapter 16 An humble Inquiry into, and Prospect of, the infinite Wisdom of God, in the Constitution of the Person of Christ, and the Way of Salvation thereby.</title>
<p>   From the consideration of the things before insisted on, we may
   endeavour, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our measure, to take a view of, and humbly
   adore, the infinite wisdom of God, in the holy contrivance of this
   great "mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh." As it is a
   spiritual, evangelical mystery, it is an effect of divine wisdom, in
   the redemption and salvation of the church, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal glory of
   God; and as it is a "great mystery," so it is the mystery of the
   "manifold wisdom of God," <reference osisRef="Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:9-10</reference> -- that is, of infinite
   wisdom working in great variety of acting and operations, suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>,
   and expressive of, its own infinite fulness: for in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> were "all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge" laid up, and laid out, <reference osisRef="Col.2.3">Colossians 2:3</reference>
   An argument this is, in some parts of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> divers of the ancient
   writers of the church have laboured, some occasionally, and some with
   express design. I shall insist only on those things which Scripture
   light leads us directly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. The depths of divine wisdom in this
   glorious work are hid from the eyes of all living. "God [alone]
   understands<note n="understandeth">Auto-modernized</note> the way of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>; and he knows<note n="knoweth">Auto-modernized</note> the place of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>;" as he
   speaks, <reference osisRef="Job.28.21 Job.28.23">Job 28:21, 23</reference> Yet is it so glorious in its effects, that
   "destruction and death say, We have heard the fame of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> with our
   ears," verse 22. The fame and report of this divine wisdom reach even
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> hell. Those who eternally perish shall hear a fame of this wisdom,
   in the glorious effects of it towards the blessed souls above, though
   some of them would not believe it here in the light of the Gospel, and
   none of them can understand it there, in their everlasting darkness.
   Hence the report which they have of the wisdom is an aggravation of
   their misery.
				</p><p>
   These depths we may admire and adore, but we cannot comprehend: "For
   who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> known the mind of the Lord in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, or with whom took he
   counsel?" Concerning the original causes of his counsels in this great
   mystery we can only say, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom
   and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgements, and his ways
   past finding out!" This alone is left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in the way of duty, that
   in the effects of them we should contemplate on their excellency, so as
   to give glory to God, and live in a holy admiration of his wisdom and
   grace. For to give glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and admire him, is our present duty,
   until he shall come eternally "to be glorified in his saints, and to be
   admired in all them that believe," <reference osisRef="2Thess.1.10">2 Thessalonians 1:10</reference>
				</p><p>
   We can do no more but stand at the shore of this ocean, and adore its
   unsearchable depths. What is delivered from them by divine revelation
   we may receive as pearls of price, to enrich and adorn our souls. For
   "the secret things belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord our God, but those things which
   are revealed belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us," that we may do "the words of this law,"
   <reference osisRef="Deut.29.29">Deuteronomy 29:29</reference> We shall not, therefore, in our inquiry into this great
   mystery, intrude ourselves into the things which we have not seen, but
   only endeavour a right understanding of what is revealed concerning it.
   For the end of all divine revelations is our knowledge of the things
   revealed, with our obedience upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>; and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end things revealed
   do belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   Some things in general are to be premised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our present inquiry.
				</p><p>
   1. We can have no view or due prospect of the wisdom of God in any of
   his works, much less in this of "sending his Son in the likeness of
   sinful flesh," or the constitution of his person, and the work of
   redemption to be accomplished thereby, unless we consider also the
   interest of the other holy properties of the divine nature in them.
   Such are his holiness, his righteousness, his sovereign authority, his
   goodness, love, and grace.
				</p><p>
   There are three excellencies of the divine nature principally to be
   considered in all the external works of God. (1.) His Goodness, which
   is the communicative property of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. This is the eternal fountain and
   spring of all divine communications. Whatever is good in and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any
   creature, is an emanation from divine goodness. "He is good, and he
   does<note n="doeth">Auto-modernized</note> good." That which acts originally in the divine nature, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   communication of itself in any blessed or gracious effects to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   creatures, is goodness. (2.) Wisdom, which is the directive power or
   excellency of the divine nature. Hereby God guides, disposes, orders,
   and directs all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own glory, in and by their own
   immediate proper ends, <reference osisRef="Prov.16.4">Proverbs 16:4</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rev.4.11">Revelation of John 4:11</reference> (3.) Power, which is
   the effective excellency of the divine nature, effecting and
   accomplishing what wisdom does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> design and order.
				</p><p>
   Whereas wisdom, therefore, is that holy excellency or power of the
   Divine Being, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God designs, and through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he effects, the glory of
   all the other properties of his nature, we cannot trace the paths of it
   in any work of God, unless we know the interest and concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of
   those other properties in that work. For that which wisdom principally
   designs, is the glorification of them. And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end the effective
   property of the divine nature, which is almighty power, always
   accompanies, or is subservient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, the directive or infinite wisdom,
   which is requisite to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfection in operation. What infinite goodness
   will communicate ad extra -- what it will open the eternal fountain of
   the Divine Being and all sufficiency to give forth -- that infinite
   wisdom designs, contrives, and directs to the glory of God; and what
   wisdom so designs, infinite power effects. See <reference osisRef="Isa.40.13 Isa.40.14 Isa.40.15 Isa.40.17 Isa.40.28">Isaiah 40:13-15, 17, 28</reference>
				</p><p>
   2. We can have no apprehensions of the interest of the other properties
   of the divine nature in this great mystery of godliness, whose glory
   was designed in infinite wisdom, without the consideration of that
   state and condition of our own in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are so concerned. That
   which was designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal glory of God in this great work of
   the incarnation of his Son, was the redemption of mankind, or the
   recovery and salvation of the church. What has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been disputed by some
   concerning it, without respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the sin of man and the salvation of
   the church, is curiosity, and indeed presumptuous folly. The whole
   Scripture constantly assigns<note n="assigneth">Auto-modernized</note> this sole end of that effect of divine
   goodness and wisdom; yea, asserts it as the only foundation of the
   Gospel, <reference osisRef="John.3.16">John 3:16</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a due contemplation of divine
   wisdom in it, it is necessary we should consider what is the nature of
   sin, especially of that first sin, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> our original apostasy from
   God did consist -- what was the condition of mankind upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> -- what is
   the concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of the holy God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, on the account of the blessed
   properties of his nature -- what way was suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our recovery, that
   God might be glorified in them all. Without a previous consideration of
   these things, we can have no due conceptions of the wisdom of God in
   this glorious work which we inquire after. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> I shall so far
   speak of them, that, if it be the will of God, the minds of those who
   read and consider them may be opened and prepared to give admittance
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> some rays of that divine wisdom in this glorious work, the lustre
   of whose full light we are not able in this world to behold.
				</p><p>
   When there was a visible pledge of the presence of God in the "bush
   that burned" and was not consumed, Moses said he "would turn aside to
   see that great sight," <reference osisRef="Exod.3.3">Exodus 3:3</reference> And this great representation of
   the glory of God being made and proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, it is certainly our
   duty to divert from all other occasions to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the contemplation of it.
   But as Moses was then commanded to put off his shoes, the place whereon
   he stood being holy ground, so it will be the wisdom of him that
   writes, and of them that read, to divest themselves of all carnal
   affections and imaginations, that they may draw nigh to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this great
   object of faith with due reverence and fear.
				</p><p>
   The first thing we are to consider, in order to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end proposed, is
   -- the nature of our sin and apostasy from God. For from thence we must
   learn the concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of the divine excellencies of God in this work.
   And there are three things that were eminent in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>: 
				</p><p>
   (1.) A reflection on the honour of the holiness and wisdom of God, in
   the rejection of his image. He had newly made man in his own image. And
   this work he so expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> as to intimate a peculiar effect of divine
   wisdom in it, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it was distinguished from all other external
   works of creation whatever, <reference osisRef="Gen.1.26 Gen.1.27">Genesis 1:26-27</reference>, "And God said, Let us make
   man in our image, after our likeness. So God created man in his own
   image, in the image of God created he him." Nowhere is there such an
   emphasis of expression concerning any work of God. And sundry things
   are represented as peculiar in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   [1^st,] That the word of consultation and that of execution are
   distinct. In all other works of creation, the word of determination and
   execution was the same. When he created light -- which seems to be the
   beauty and glory of the whole creation -- he only said, "Let there be
   light; and there was light," <reference osisRef="Gen.1.3">Genesis 1:3</reference> So was it with all other
   things. But when he comes to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the creation of man, another process is
   proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our faith. These several words are distinct, not in time,
   but in nature. "God said, Let us make man in our image and likeness;"
   and upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> it is added distinctly, as the execution of that antecedent
   counsel, "So God made man in his own image." This puts a signal
   eminency on this work of God.
				</p><p>
   [2^dly,] A distinct, peculiar concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of all the persons of the
   holy Trinity, in their consultation and operation, is in like manner
   proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us: "And God said, Let us make man." The truth of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> I
   have sufficiently evinced elsewhere, and discovered the vanity of all
   other glosses and expositions. The properties of the divine nature
   principally and originally considerable, in all external operations,
   (as we have newly observed,) are goodness, wisdom, and power. In this
   great work, divine goodness exerted itself eminently and effectually in
   the person of the Father -- the eternal fountain and spring, as of the
   divine nature, so of all divine operations. Divine wisdom acted itself
   peculiarly in the person of the Son; this being the principal notion
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> -- the eternal Wisdom of the Father. Divine power wrought
   effectually in the person of the Holy Spirit; who is the immediate
   actor of all divine operations.
				</p><p>
   [3^dly,] The proposition of the effecting this work, being by way of
   consultation, represents it a signal effect of infinite wisdom. These
   expressions are used to lead us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the contemplation of that wisdom.
				</p><p>
   Thus, "God made man in his own image;" that is, in such a rectitude of
   nature as represented his righteousness and holiness -- in such a state
   and condition as had a reflection on it of his power and rule. The
   former was the substance of it -- the latter a necessary consequent
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. This representation, I say, of God, in power and rule, was not
   that image of God in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> man was created, but a consequent of it. So
   the words and their order declare: "Let us make man in our image, and
   after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the
   sea," etc.. Because he was made in the image of God, this dominion and
   rule were granted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. So fond is their imagination, who would
   have the image of God to consist solely in these things. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the
   loss of the image of God was not originally the loss of power and
   dominion, or a right to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; but man was deprived of that right, on
   the loss of that image which it was granted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. In which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it did
   consist, see <reference osisRef="Eccl.7.29">Ecclesiastes 7:29</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:24</reference>
				</p><p>
   Three things God designed in this communication of his image to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   nature, which were his principal ends in the creation of all things
   here below; and therefore was divine wisdom more eminently exerted
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> than in all the other works of this inferior creation.
				</p><p>
   The first was, that he might in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> make a representation of his
   holiness and righteousness among his creatures. This was not done in
   any other of them. Characters they had on them of his goodness, wisdom,
   and power. In these things the "heavens declare the glory of God, and
   the firmament shows<note n="showeth">Auto-modernized</note> his handy-work." His eternal power and Godhead
   are manifest in the things that are made; but none of them, not the
   whole fabric of heaven and earth, with all their glorious ornaments and
   endowments, were either fit or able to receive any impressions of his
   holiness and righteousness -- of any of the moral perfections or
   universal rectitude of his nature. Yet, in the demonstration and
   representation of these things does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God principally
   consist. Without them, he could not be known and glorified as God.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he would have an image and representation of them in the
   creation here below. And this he will always have, so long as he will
   be worshipped by any of his creatures. And therefore, when it was lost
   in Adam, it was renewed in Christ, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been declared.
				</p><p>
   The second was, that it might be a means of rendering actual glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him from all other parts of the creation. Without this, which is as the
   animating life and form of the whole, the other creatures are but as a
   dead thing. They could not any way declare the glory of God, but
   passively and objectively. They were as an harmonious, well-tuned
   instrument, which gives no sound unless there be a skilful hand to move
   and act it. What is light, if there be no eye to see it? or what is
   music, if there be no ear to hear it? How glorious and beautiful soever
   any of the works of creation appear to be, from impressions of divine
   power, wisdom, and goodness on them; yet, without this image of God in
   man, there was nothing here below to understand God in them -- to
   glorify God by them. This alone is that through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>, in a way of
   admiration, obedience, and praise, we were enabled to render to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God
   all the glory which he designed from those works of his power.
				</p><p>
   The third was, that it might be a means to bring man to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that eternal
   enjoyment of Himself, which he was fitted for and designed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. For
   this was to be done in a way of obedience; -- "Do this and live," was
   that rule of it which the nature of God and man, with their mutual
   relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one another, did require. But we were made meet for this
   obedience, and enabled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, only by virtue of this image of God
   implanted in our natures. It was morally a power to live to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in
   obedience, that we might come to the enjoyment of him in glory.
				</p><p>
   Evident it is that these were the principal ends of God in the creation
   of all things. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> this constitution of our nature, and the
   furnishing<note n="furnishment">Auto-modernized</note> of it with the image of God, was the most eminent effect of
   infinite wisdom in all the outward works of the divine nature.
				</p><p>
   (2.) In the entrance of sin, and by apostasy from God, man voluntarily
   rejected and defaced this blessed representation of the righteousness
   and holiness of God -- this great effect of his goodness and wisdom, in
   its tendency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his eternal glory, and our enjoyment of him. No
   greater dishonour could be done to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- no endeavour could have
   been more pernicious in casting contempt on his counsel. For as his
   holiness, which was represented in that image, was despoiled, so we did
   what lay in us to defeat the contrivance of his wisdom. This will be
   evident by reflecting on the ends of it now mentioned. For --
				</p><p>
   [1.] Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> there remained nothing, in all the creation here below,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> any representation might be made of God's holiness and
   righteousness, or any of the moral perfections of his nature. How could
   it be done, this image being lost out of the world? The brute,
   inanimate part of the creation, however stupendously great in its
   matter and glorious in its outward form, was no way capable of it. The
   nature of man under the loss of this image -- fallen, depraved,
   polluted, and corrupted -- gives rather a representation and image of
   Satan than of God. Hence -- instead of goodness, love, righteousness,
   holiness, peace, all virtues usefully communicative and effective of
   the good of the whole race of mankind, which would have been effects of
   this image of God, and representatives of his nature -- the whole
   world, from and by the nature of man, is filled with envy, malice,
   revenge, cruelty, oppression, and all engines of promoting self,
   to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> man is wholly turned, as fallen off from God. He that would
   learn the divine nature, from the representation that is made of it in
   the present acting of the nature of man, will be gradually led to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   devil instead of God. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> no greater indignity could be offered
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom and holiness, than there was in this rejection of
   the image of God in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we were created.
				</p><p>
   [2.] There was no way left through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> glory might redound to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God from
   the remainder of the creation here below. For the nature of man
   alonewas designed to be the way and means of it, by virtue of the image
   of God implanted on it. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> man by sin did not only draw off
   himself from that relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was made, but drew off
   the whole creation here below with himself into a uselessness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   glory. And upon the entrance of sin, before the cure of our apostasy
   was actually accomplished, the generality of mankind divided the
   creatures into two sorts -- those above, or the heavenly bodies, and
   those here below. Those of the first sort they worshipped as their
   gods; and those of the other sort they abused to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their lusts.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> God was every way dishonored in and by them all, nor was
   there any glory given him on their account. What some attempted to do
   of that nature, in a wisdom of their own, ended in folly and a renewed
   dishonour of God; as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Rom.1.18 Rom.1.19 Rom.1.21 Rom.1.22">Romans 1:18-19, 21-22</reference>
				</p><p>
   [3.] Man hereby lost all power and ability of attaining that end for
   which he was made -- namely, the eternal enjoyment of God. Upon the
   matter, and as much as in us lay, the whole end of God in the creation
   of all things here below was utterly defeated.
				</p><p>
   But that which was the malignity and poison of this sin, was the
   contempt that was cast on the holiness of God, whose representation,
   and all its express characters, were utterly despised and rejected
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, then, lay the concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of the holiness or
   righteousness of God in this sin of our nature, which we are inquiring
   after. Unless some reparation be made for the indignity cast upon it in
   the rejection of the image and representation of it -- unless there be
   some way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it may be more eminently exalted in the nature of man
   than it was debased and despised in the same nature; it was just,
   equal, righteous with God -- that which becomes the rectitude and
   purity of his nature -- that mankind should perish eternally in that
   condition into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> it was cast by sin.
				</p><p>
   It was not, therefore, consistent with the glory of God, that mankind
   should be restored, that this nature of ours should be brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   enjoyment of him, unless his holiness be more exalted, be more
   conspicuously represented in the same nature, than ever it was
   depressed or despised thereby. The demonstration of its glory in any
   other nature, as in that of angels, would not serve to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end; as
   we shall see afterward.
				</p><p>
   We must now a little return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what we before laid down. Wisdom being
   the directive power of all divine operations, and the end of all those
   operations being the glory of God himself, or the demonstration of the
   excellencies of the holy properties of his nature, it was incumbent
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> to provide for the honour and glory of divine holiness in an
   exaltation answerable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the attempt for its debasement. Without the
   consideration of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, we can have no due prospect of the acting of
   infinite wisdom in this great work of our redemption and recovery by
   the incarnation of the Son of God.
				</p><p>
   (3.) Sin brought disorder and disturbance into the whole rule and
   government of God. It was necessary, from the infinite wisdom of God,
   that all things should be made in perfect order and harmony -- all in a
   direct subordination to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his glory. There could have been no original
   defect in the natural or moral order of things, but it must have
   proceeded from a defect in wisdom; for the disposal of all things into
   their proper order belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the contrivance of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. And the
   harmony of all things among themselves, with all their mutual relations
   and aspects in a regular tendency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their proper and utmost end --
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> though every individual subsistence or being has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a peculiar
   end of its own, yet all their actings and all their ends tend directly
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one utmost common end of them all -- is the principal effect of
   wisdom. And thus was it at the beginning, when God himself beheld the
   universe, and, "lo, it was exceeding good."
				</p><p>
   All things being thus created and stated, it belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the nature
   of God to be the rector and disposer of them all.
				</p><p>
   It was not a mere free act of his will, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God chose to rule and
   govern the creation according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law of the nature of all things,
   and their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; but it was necessary, from his divine
   being and excellences, that so he should do. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it concerned
   both the wisdom and righteousness of God to take care that either all
   things should be preserved in the state in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they were created, and
   no disorder be suffered to enter into the kingdom and rule of God, or
   that, in a way suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, his glory should be retrieved and
   re-established; for God is not the God of confusion -- neither the
   author nor approver of it -- neither in his works nor in his rule. But
   sin actually brought disorder into the kingdom and rule of God. And
   this it did not in any one particular instance, but that which was
   universal as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all things here below. For the original harmony and
   order of all things consisted in their subordination to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of
   God. But this they all lost, as was before declared. Hence he who
   looked on them in their constitution, and, to manifest his complacency
   in them, affirmed them to be "exceeding good," immediately on the
   entrance of sin, pronounced a curse on the whole earth, and all things
   contained in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   To suffer this disorder to continue unrectified, was not consistent
   with the wisdom and righteousness of God. It would make the kingdom of
   God to be like that of Satan -- full of darkness and confusion. Nothing
   is more necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the good of the universe, and without which it
   were better it were annihilated, than the preservation of the honour of
   God in his government. And this could no otherwise be done, but by the
   infliction of a punishment proportionable in justice to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the demerit
   of sin. Some think this might be done by a free dismission of sin, or a
   passing it over without any punishment at all. But what evidence should
   we then have that good and evil were not alike, and almost equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God in his rule -- that he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not like sin as well as uprightness?
   Nor would this supposition leave any grounds of exercising justice
   among men. For if God, in misrule of all things, dismissed the greatest
   sin without any penalty inflicted, what reason have we to judge that
   evils among ourselves should at all be punished? That, therefore, be
   far from God, that the righteous should be as the wicked: "Shall not
   the Judge of all the earth do right?"
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the order of God's rule being broken, as it consisted in the
   regular obedience of the creature, and disorder with confusion being
   brought thereby into the kingdom and government of God; his
   righteousness, as it is the rectorial virtue and power of the divine
   nature, required that his glory should be restored, by reducing the
   sinning creature again into order by punishment. Justice, therefore,
   must be answered and complied withal in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its eternal
   and unanswerable law, in a way suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God, or the
   sinning creature must perish eternally.
				</p><p>
   In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the righteousness of God, as the rectorial virtue of the divine
   nature, was concerned in the sin and apostasy of men. The vindication
   and glory of it -- to provide that in nothing it were eclipsed or
   diminished -- was incumbent on infinite wisdom, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the rule
   before laid down. That must direct and dispose of all things anew to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the glory of the righteousness of God, or there is no recovery of
   mankind. And in our inquiry after the impressions of divine wisdom on
   the great and glorious means of our restoration under consideration,
   this provision made thereby for the righteousness of God, in his rule
   and government of all, is greatly to be attended to.
				</p><p>
   (4.) Man by sin put himself into the power of the devil, God's greatest
   adversary. The devil had newly, by rebellion and apostasy from his
   first condition, cast himself under the eternal displeasure and wrath
   of God. God had righteously purposed in himself not to spare him, nor
   contrive any way for his deliverance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity. He, on the other
   side, was become obdurate in his malice and hatred of God, designing
   his dishonour and the impeachment of his glory with the utmost of his
   remaining abilities. In this state of things, man voluntarily leaves
   the rule and conduct of God, with all his dependence upon him, and puts
   himself into the power of the devil; for he believed Satan above God --
   that is, placed his faith and confidence in him, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the way of
   attaining blessedness and true happiness. And in whom we place our
   trust and confidence, them do we obey, whatever we profess. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> did
   God's adversary seem for a season to triumph against him, as if he had
   defeated the great design of his goodness, wisdom, and power. So he
   would have continued to do, if no way had been provided for his
   disappointment.
				</p><p>
   This, therefore, also belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the care of divine wisdom, --
   namely, that the glory of God in none of the holy properties of his
   nature did suffer any diminution hereby.
				</p><p>
   All this, and inconceivably more than we are able to express, being
   contained in the sin of our apostasy from God, it must needs follow
   that the condition of all mankind became thereby inexpressibly evil. As
   we had done all the moral evil which our nature was capable to act, so
   it was meet we should receive all the penal evil which our nature was
   capable to undergo; and it all issued in death temporal and eternal,
   inflicted from the wrath of God.
				</p><p>
   This is the first thing to be considered in our tracing the footsteps
   of divine wisdom in our deliverance by the incarnation of the Son of
   God. Without due conceptions of the nature of this sin and apostasy --
   of the provocation given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God thereby, of the injury attempted to
   be done to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of all his properties, of his concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in
   their reparation, with the unspeakable misery that mankind was fallen
   into -- we cannot have the least view of the glorious acting of divine
   wisdom in our deliverance by Christ; and, therefore, the most of those
   who are insensible of these things, do wholly reject the principal
   instances of infinite wisdom in our redemption; as we shall yet see
   farther afterward. And the great reason why the glory of God in Christ
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> so little irradiate the minds of many, that it is so much
   neglected and despised, is because they are not acquainted nor affected
   with the nature of our first sin and apostasy, neither in itself nor
   its woeful effects and consequents.
				</p><p>
   But, on the supposition of these things, a double inquiry arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> with
   reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the wisdom of God, and the other holy properties of his
   nature immediately concerned in our sin and apostasy.
				</p><p>
   1. Whereas man by sin had defaced the image of God, and lost it,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> there was no representation of his holiness and righteousness
   left in the whole creation here below -- no way of rendering any glory
   to him, in, for, or by, any other of his works -- no means to bring man
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of God, for which he was made; -- and whereas he had
   brought confusion and disorder into the rule and kingdom of God, which,
   according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law of creation and its sanction, could not be
   rectified but by the eternal ruin of the sinner; and had, moreover,
   given up himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the rule and conduct of Satan:  whether, I say,
   upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> it was meet, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the holy properties of the divine
   nature, that all mankind should be left eternally in this condition,
   without remedy or relief? or whether there were not a condecency and
   suitableness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, that at least our nature in some portion of it
   should be restored?
				</p><p>
   2. Upon a supposition that the granting of a recovery was suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the holy perfections of the divine nature, acting themselves by
   infinite wisdom, what rays of that wisdom may we discern in the finding
   out and constitution of the way and means of that recovery?
				</p><p>
   The first of these I shall speak briefly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> in this place, because I
   have treated more largely concerning it in another. For there are many
   things which argue a condecency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine perfections in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> --
   namely, that mankind should not be left utterly remediless in that
   guilt of misery into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> it was plunged. I shall at present only
   insist on one of them.
				</p><p>
   God had originally created two sorts of intellectual creatures, capable
   of the eternal enjoyment of himself -- namely, angels and men. That he
   would so make either sort or both, was a mere effect of his sovereign
   wisdom and pleasure; but on a supposition that he would so make them,
   they must be made for his glory. These two sorts thus created he placed
   in several habitations, prepared for them, suitable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their natures
   and the present duties required of them; the angels in heaven above,
   and men on earth below. Sin first invaded the nature of angels, and
   cast innumerable multitudes of them out of their primitive condition.
   Hereby they lost their capacity of, and right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, that enjoyment of
   God which their nature was prepared and made meet for; neither would
   God ever restore them to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. And in the instance of dealing with
   them, when he "spared them not, but shut them up in chains of
   everlasting darkness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the judgement of the great day," he
   manifested how righteous it was to leave sinning, apostate creatures in
   everlasting misery. If anything of relief be provided for any of them,
   it is a mere effect of sovereign grace and wisdom, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> God was no
   way obliged. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, the whole angelical nature, that was created in a
   capacity for the eternal enjoyment of God, perished not; nor does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it
   seem consistent with the wisdom and goodness of God, that the whole
   entire species or kind of creatures made capable of glory in the
   eternal enjoyment of him, should at once immediately be excluded from
   it. That such a thing should fall out as it were accidentally, without
   divine provision and disposal, would argue a defect in wisdom, and a
   possibility of a surprisal into the loss of the whole glory he designed
   in the creation of all things; and to have it a mere effect of divine
   ordination and disposal, is as little consistent with his goodness.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, the same nature which sinned and perished in the angels that
   fell, abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note> in the enjoyment of God in those myriads of blessed
   spirits which "left not their first habitation."
				</p><p>
   The nature of man was in like manner made capable of the eternal
   enjoyment of God. This was the end for which it was created, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   glory of him by whom it was made; for it became the divine wisdom and
   goodness, to give to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> everything an operation and end suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its
   capacity. And these, in this race of intellectual creatures, were to
   live to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and to come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal enjoyment of him. This
   operation and end their nature being capable of, they being suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them it was designed. But sin entered them also; we also
   "sinned, and came short of the glory of God." The inquiry upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> is,
   whether it became the divine goodness and wisdom that this whole
   nature, in all that were partakers of it, should fail and come short of
   that end for which alone it was made of God? For whereas the angels
   stood, in their primitive condition, every one in his own individual
   person, the sin of some did not prejudice others, who did not sin
   actually themselves. But the whole race of mankind stood all in one
   common head and state; from whom they were to be educed and derived by
   natural generation. The sin and apostasy of that one person was the sin
   and apostasy of us all. In him all sinned and died. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, unless
   there be a recovery made of them, or of some from among them, that
   whole species of intellectual nature -- the whole kind of it, in all
   its individuals -- which was made capable of doing the will of God, so
   as to come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal fruition of him, must be eternally lost and
   excluded from it. This, we may say, became not the wisdom and goodness
   of God, no more than it would have done to have suffered the whole
   angelical nature, in all its individuals, to have perished for ever. No
   created understanding could have been able to discern the glory of God
   in such a dispensation, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it would have had no glory. That the
   whole nature, in all the individuals of it, which was framed by the
   power of God out of nothing, and made what it was for this very end,
   that it might glorify him, and come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of him, should
   eternally perish, if any way of relief for any portion of it were
   possible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> infinite wisdom, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not give an amiable representation
   of the divine excellencies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   It was therefore left on the provision of infinite wisdom, that this
   great effect, of recovering a portion of fallen mankind out of this
   miserable estate, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there was a suitableness, a condecency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the divine excellencies, should be produced; only, it was to be done on
   and by a free act of the will of God; for otherwise there was no
   obligation on him from any of his properties so to do.
				</p><p>
   But it may be yet said, on the other side, that the nature of man was
   so defiled, so depraved, so corrupted, so alienated and separated from
   God, so obnoxious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the curse by its sin and apostasy, that it was
   not reparable to the glory of God; and therefore it would not argue any
   defect in divine power, nor any unsuitableness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom and
   goodness, if it were not actually repaired and restored. I answer two
   things.
				</p><p>
   (1.) The horrible nature of the first sin, and the heinousness of our
   apostasy from God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, were such and so great, as that God upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>
   might righteously, and suitably to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the holy properties of his
   nature, leave mankind to perish eternally in that condition into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note>
   they had cast themselves; and if he had utterly forsaken the whole race
   of mankind in that condition, and left them all as remediless as the
   fallen angels, there could have been no reflection on his goodness, and
   an evident suitableness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his justice and holiness. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>,
   wherever there is any mention in the Scripture of the redemption or
   restoration of mankind, it is constantly proposed as an effect of mere
   sovereign grace and mercy. See <reference osisRef="Eph.1.3 Eph.1.4 Eph.1.5 Eph.1.6 Eph.1.7 Eph.1.8 Eph.1.9 Eph.1.10 Eph.1.11">Ephesians 1:3-11</reference> And those who pretend a
   great difficulty at present, in the reconciliation of the eternal
   perishing of the greatest part of mankind with those notions we have of
   the divine goodness, seem not to have sufficiently considered what was
   contained in our original apostasy from God, nor the righteousness of
   God in dealing with the angels that sinned. For when man had
   voluntarily broken all the relation of love and moral good between God
   and him, had defaced his image -- the only representation of his
   holiness and righteousness in this lower world -- and deprived him of
   all his glory from the works of his hands, and had put himself into the
   society and under the conduct of the devil; what dishonour could it
   have been to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, what diminution would there have been of his glory,
   if he had left him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own choice -- to eat for ever of the fruit
   of his own ways, and to be filled with his own devices to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity?
   It is only infinite wisdom that could find out a way for the salvation
   of any one of the whole race of mankind, so as that it might be
   reconciled to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of his holiness, righteousness, and rule.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as we ought always to admire sovereign grace in the few that
   shall be saved, so we have no ground to reflect on divine goodness in
   the multitudes that perish, especially considering that they all
   voluntarily continue in their sin and apostasy.
				</p><p>
   (2.) I grant the nature of man was not reparable nor recoverable by any
   such actings of the properties of God as he had exerted in the creation
   and rule of all things. Were there not other properties of the divine
   nature than what were discovered and revealed in the creation of all --
   were not some of them so declared capable of an exercise in another way
   or in higher degrees than what had as yet been instanced in -- it must
   be acknowledged that the reparation of mankind could not be conceived
   compliant with the divine excellencies, nor to be effected by them. I
   shall give one instance in each sort; namely, first in properties of
   another kind than any which had been manifested in the works of
   creation, and then the acting of some of them so manifested, in another
   way, or farther degree than what they were before exerted in or by.
				</p><p>
   [1.] Of the first sort are love, grace, and mercy, which I refer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   one head -- their nature being the same, as they have respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   sinners. For although there were none of them manifested in the works
   of creation, yet are they no less essential properties of the divine
   nature than either power, goodness, or wisdom. With these it was that
   the reparation of our nature was compliant -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them it had a
   condecency; and the glory of them infinite wisdom designed in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
   That wisdom, on which it is incumbent to provide for the manifestation
   of all the other properties of God's nature, contrived this work to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the glory of his love, mercy, and grace; as in the gospel it is
   everywhere declared.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Of the second sort is divine goodness. This, as the communicative
   property of the divine nature, had exerted itself in the creation of
   all things. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, it had not done so perfectly -- it had not done so
   to the uttermost. But the nature of goodness being communicative, it
   belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its perfection to act itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the uttermost. This it
   had not yet done in the creation. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> "God made man," and acted his
   goodness in the communication of our being to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, with all its
   endowments. But there yet remained another effect of it; which was,
   that God should be made man, as the way to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, and the means of, our
   recovery.
				</p><p>
   These things being premised, we proceed to inquire more particularly by
   what way and means the recovery of mankind might be wrought, so as that
   God might be glorified thereby.
				</p><p>
   If fallen man be restored and reinstated in his primitive condition, or
   brought into a better, it must either be by himself, or by some other
   undertaking for him; for it must be done by some means or other. So
   great an alteration in the whole state of things was made by the
   entrance of sin, that it was not consistent with the glory of any of
   the divine excellencies that a restoration of all things should be made
   by a mere act of power, without the use of any means for the removal of
   the cause of that alteration. That man himself could not be this means
   -- that is, that he could not restore himself -- is openly evident. Two
   ways there were through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he might attempt it, and neither jointly nor
   severally could he do anything in them.
				</p><p>
   1. He might do it by returning to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God on his own
   accord. He fell off from God on his own accord by disobedience, through
   the suggestion of Satan; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, a voluntary return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his former
   obedience would seem to reduce all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their first estate. But
   this way was both impossible, and, upon a supposition of it, would have
   been insufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end designed. For --
				</p><p>
   (1.) This he could not do. He had, by his sin and fall, lost that power
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he was able to yield any acceptable obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God; and a
   return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience is an act of greater power than a persistency in
   the way and course of it, and more is required to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. But all man's
   original power of obedience consisted in the image of God. This he had
   defaced in himself, and deprived himself of. Having, therefore, lost
   that power which should have enabled him to live to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in his
   primitive condition, he could not retain a greater power in the same
   kind to return to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. This, indeed, was that which Satan deceived
   and deluded him withal; namely, that by his disobedience he should
   acquire new light and power, which he had not yet received -- he should
   be "like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God." But he was so far from any advantage by his
   apostasy, that one part of his misery consisted in the loss of all
   power or ability to live to God.
				</p><p>
   This is the folly of that Pelagian heresy, which is now a third time
   attempting to impose itself on the Christian world. It supposes<note n="supposeth">Auto-modernized</note> that
   men have a power of their own to return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, after they had lost
   the power they had of abiding with him. It is not, indeed, as yet,
   pretended by many that the first sin was a mere transient act, that no
   way vitiated our nature, or impaired the power, faculty, or principle
   of obedience in us. A wound, they say, a disease, a weakness, it
   brought upon us, and rendered us legally obnoxious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death temporal,
   which we were naturally liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> before. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it is not said
   that men can return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that perfect obedience which the law required;
   but that they can comply with and perform that which the gospel
   requires<note n="requireth">Auto-modernized</note> in the room of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. For they seem to suppose that the gospel
   is not much more but an accommodation of the rule of obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   present reason and abilities, with some motives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, and an example
   for it in the personal obedience and suffering of Christ. For whereas
   man forsook the law of obedience first prescribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and fell
   into various incapacities of observing it, God did not, as they
   suppose, provide, in and by the Gospel, a righteousness through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the law
   might be fulfilled, and effectual grace to raise up the nature of man
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the performance of acceptable obedience; but only brings down the
   law and the rule of it into a compliance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our weakened, diseased,
   depraved nature; -- than which, if anything can be spoken more
   dishonourably of the Gospel, I know it not. However, this pretended
   power of returning to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> some kind of obedience, but not that which was
   required of us in our primitive condition, is no way sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   our restoration; as is evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all.
				</p><p>
   (2.) As man could not effect his own recovery, so he would not attempt
   it. For he was fallen into that condition in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>, in the principles of
   all his moral operations, he was at enmity against God; and whatever
   did befall him, he would choose to continue in his state of apostasy;
   for he was wholly "alienated from the life of God." He likes it not, as
   that which is incompliant with his dispositions, inclinations, and
   desires -- as inconsistent with everything in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he places<note n="placeth">Auto-modernized</note> his
   interest. And hence, as he cannot do what he should through impotency,
   he will not do even what he can through obstinacy. It may be, we know
   not distinctly what to ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> man's impotency, and what to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   obstinacy; but between both, he neither can nor will return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
   And his power to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> good, though not sufficient to bring him again to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, yet is it not so small but that he always chooses<note n="chooseth">Auto-modernized</note> not to make use
   of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end. In brief, there was left in man a fear of divine
   power -- a fear of God because of his greatness -- which makes him do
   many things which otherwise he would not do; but there is not left in
   him any love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine goodness, without which he cannot choose to
   return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
				</p><p>
   (3.) But let us leave these things which men will dispute about, though
   in express contradiction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Scripture and the experience of them
   that are wrought upon to believe; and let us make an impossible
   supposition -- that man could and would return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his primitive
   obedience; yet no reparation of the glory of God, suffering in the loss
   of the former state of all things, would upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> ensue. What
   satisfaction would be hereby made for the injury offered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   holiness, righteousness, and wisdom of God, whose violation in their
   blessed effects was the principal evil of sin? Notwithstanding such a
   supposition, all the disorder that was brought into the rule and
   government of God by sin, with the reflection of dishonour upon him, in
   the rejection of his image, would still continue. And such a
   restitution of things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> no provision is made for the reparation
   of the glory of God, is not to be admitted. The notion of it may
   possibly please men in their apostate condition, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are
   wholly turned off from God, and into self -- not caring what becomes of
   his glory, so it may go well with themselves; but it is highly
   contradictory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all equity, justice, and the whole reason of things,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God is the principal and centre of all.
				</p><p>
   Practically, things are otherwise among many. The most profligate
   sinners in the world, that have a conviction of an eternal condition,
   would be saved. Tell them it is inconsistent with the glory of the
   holiness, righteousness, and truth of God, to save unbelieving,
   impenitent sinners -- they are not concerned in it. Let them be saved
   that is, -- eternally delivered from the evil they fear -- and let God
   look to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own glory; they take no care about it. A soul that is
   spiritually ingenuous, would not be saved in any way but that through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   God may be glorified. Indeed, to be saved, and not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of
   God, implies a contradiction; for our salvation is eternal blessedness,
   in a participation of the glory of God.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, It follows<note n="followeth">Auto-modernized</note>, therefore, that man must make satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the justice of God, and thereby a reparation of his glory, that he may
   be saved. This, added to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a complete return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience, would
   effect a restitution of all things; it would do so as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what was
   past, though it would make no new addition of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. But this
   became not the nature and efficacy of divine wisdom. It became it not
   merely to retrieve what was past, without a new manifestation and
   exaltation of the divine excellencies. And therefore, in our
   restitution by Christ, there is such a manifestation and exaltation of
   the divine properties as incomparably exceeds whatever could have
   ensued on, or been effected by, the law of creation, had man continued
   in his original obedience. But at present it is granted that this
   addition of satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience, would restore
   all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their just condition. But as that return was impossible
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> man, so was this satisfaction for the injury done by sin much
   more. For suppose a mere creature, such as man is, such as all men are,
   in what condition you please, and under all advantageous circumstances,
   yet, whatever he can do towards God is antecedently and absolutely due
   from him in that instant in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it, and that in the manner
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is done. They must all say, when they have done all that
   they can do, "We are unprofitable servants; we have done what was our
   duty." Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it is impossible that, by anything a man can do well,
   he should make satisfaction for anything he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done ill. For what he
   so does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> is due in and for itself; and to suppose that satisfaction will
   be made for a former fault by that whose omission would have been
   another, had the former never been committed, is madness. An old debt
   cannot be discharged with ready money for new commodities; nor can past
   injuries be compensated by present duties, which we are anew obliged
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> -- mankind being indispensably and eternally obliged
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the present performance of all duties of obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God,
   according to the utmost of their capacity and ability, so as that the
   non-performance of them in their season, both as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their matter and
   manner, would be their sin -- it is utterly impossible that by
   anything, or all that they can do, they should make the least
   satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God for anything they have done against him; much
   less for the horrible apostasy of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we treat. And to attempt the
   same end by any way which God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not appointed, which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not
   made their duty, is a new provocation of the highest nature. See <reference osisRef="Mic.6.6 Mic.6.7 Mic.6.8">Micah 6:6-8</reference>
				</p><p>
   It is therefore evident, on all these considerations, that all mankind,
   as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any endeavours of their own, anything that can be fancied as
   possible for them to design or do, must be left irreparable, in a
   condition of eternal misery. And unless we have a full conviction
   of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, we can neither admire nor entertain the mystery of the wisdom
   of God in our reparation. And therefore it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been the design of
   Satan, in all ages, to contrive presumptuous notions of men's spiritual
   abilities -- to divert their minds from the contemplation of the glory
   of divine wisdom and grace, as alone exalted in our recovery.
				</p><p>
   We are proceeding on this supposition, that there was a condecency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the holy perfections of the divine nature, that mankind should be
   restored, or some portion of it recovered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of
   himself; so angelical nature was preserved to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same end in those
   that did not sin. And we have showed the general grounds whereon it is
   impossible that fallen man should restore or recover himself. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>
   we must, in the next place, inquire what is necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> such a
   restoration, on the account of that concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of the divine
   excellencies in the sin and apostasy of man which we have stated
   before; for hereby we may obtain light, and an insight into the glory
   of that wisdom through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it was contrived and effected. And the things
   following, among others, may be observed under that end: 
				</p><p>
   1. It was required that there should be an obedience yielded to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God,
   bringing more glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him than dishonour did arise and accrue from
   the disobedience of man. This was due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of divine holiness
   in giving of the law. Until this was done, the excellency of the law,
   as becoming the holiness of God, and as an effect of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, could not be
   made manifest. For if it were never kept in any instance, never
   fulfilled by any one person in the world, how should the glory of it be
   declared? -- how should the holiness of God be represented by it? --
   how should it be evident that the transgression of it was not rather
   from some defect in the law itself, than from any evil in them that
   should have yielded obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it? The obedience yielded by the
   angels that stood and sinned not, made it manifest that the
   transgression of it by them that fell and sinned was from their own
   wills, and not from any unsuitableness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their nature and state in
   the law itself. But if the law given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> man should never be complied
   withal in perfect obedience by any one whatever, it might be thought
   that the law itself was unsuited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our nature, and impossible to be
   complied withal. Nor did it become infinite wisdom to give a law whose
   equity, righteousness, and holiness, should never be exemplified in
   obedience -- should never be made to appear but in the punishment
   inflicted on its transgressors. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the original law of personal
   righteousness was not given solely nor primarily that men might suffer
   justly for its transgression, but that God might be glorified in its
   accomplishment. If this be not done, it is impossible that men should
   be restored to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God. If the law be not fulfilled by
   obedience, man must suffer evermore for his disobedience, or God must
   lose the manifestation of his holiness in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. Besides, God had
   represented his holiness in that image of it which was implanted on our
   nature, and which was the principle enabling us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience. This
   also was rejected by sin, and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> the holiness of God despised. If
   this be not restored in our nature, and that with advantages above what
   it had in its first communication, we cannot be recovered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   glory of God.
				</p><p>
   2. It was necessary that the disorder brought into the rule and
   government of God by sin and rebellion should be rectified. This could
   no otherwise be done but by the infliction of that punishment which, in
   the unalterable rule and standard of divine justice, was due to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
   The dismission of sin on any other terms would leave the rule of God
   under unspeakable dishonour and confusion; for where is the
   righteousness of government, if the highest sin and provocation that
   our nature was capable of, and which brought confusion on the whole
   creation below, should for ever go unpunished? The first express
   intimation that God gave of his righteousness in the government of
   mankind, was his threatening a punishment equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the demerit of
   disobedience, if man should fall into it: "In the day thou eatest
   of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> thou shalt die." If he revoke and disannul this sentence, how
   shall the glory of his righteousness in the rule of all be made known?
   But how this punishment should be undergone, which consisted in man's
   eternal ruin, and yet man be eternally saved, was a work for divine
   wisdom to contrive. This, therefore, was necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the honour of
   God's righteousness, as he is the supreme Governor and Judge of all the
   earth
				</p><p>
   3. It was necessary that Satan should be justly despoiled of his
   advantage and power over mankind, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God; for he was not
   to be left to triumph in his success. And inasmuch as man was, on his
   part, rightfully given up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, his deliverance was not to be
   wrought by an act of absolute dominion and power, but in a way of
   justice and lawful judgement; which things shall be afterward spoken
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Without these things the recovery of mankind into the favour and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the enjoyment of God was utterly impossible, on the account of the
   concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of the glory of his divine perfections in our sin and
   apostasy.
				</p><p>
   How all this might be effected -- how the glory of the holiness and
   righteousness of God in his law and rule, and in the primitive
   constitution of our nature, might be repaired -- how his goodness,
   love, grace, and mercy, might be manifested and exalted in this work of
   the reparation of mankind -- was left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the care and contrivance of
   infinite wisdom. From the eternal springs of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> must this work arise,
   or cease for ever.
				</p><p>
   To trace some of the footsteps of divine wisdom in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, in and from the
   revelation of it by its effects, is that which lies<note n="lieth">Auto-modernized</note> before us. And
   sundry things appear to have been necessary to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. As --
				</p><p>
   1. That all things required to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our restoration, the whole work
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they consist, must be wrought in our own nature -- in the
   nature that had sinned, and which was to be restored and brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   glory. On supposition, I say, of the salvation of our nature, no
   satisfaction can be made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God for the sin of that
   nature, but in the nature itself that sinned and is to be saved. For
   whereas God gave the law to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> man as an effect of his wisdom and
   holiness, which he transgressed in his disobedience, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> could the
   glory of them or either of them be exalted, if the same law were
   complied withal and fulfilled in and by a nature of another kind --
   suppose that of angels? For, notwithstanding any such obedience, yet
   the law might be unsuited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the nature of man, to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> it was
   originally prescribed. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, there would be a veil drawn over the
   glory of God in giving the law to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> man, if it were not fulfilled by
   obedience in the same nature; nor can there be any such relation
   between the obedience and sufferings of one nature in the stead and for
   the disobedience of another, as that glory might ensue to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the wisdom,
   holiness, and justice of God, in the deliverance of that other nature
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   The Scripture abounds in the declaration of the necessity of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, with
   its condecency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom. Speaking of the way of our relief
   and recovery, "Verily," says the apostle, "he took not on him the
   nature of angels," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:16</reference> Had it been the recovery of angels
   which he designed, he would have taken their nature on him. But this
   would have been no relief at all to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, no more than the assuming of
   our nature is of advantage to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the fallen angels. The obedience and
   sufferings of Christ in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> extended not at all to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them -- nor was
   it just or equal that they should be relieved thereby. What, then, was
   required to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our deliverance? Why, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "Forasmuch as the
   children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
   took part of the same," verse 14. It was human nature (here expressed
   by flesh and blood) that was to be delivered; and therefore it was
   human nature in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> this deliverance was to be wrought. This the same
   apostle disputes at large, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.12 Rom.5.13 Rom.5.14 Rom.5.15 Rom.5.16 Rom.5.17 Rom.5.18 Rom.5.19">Romans 5:12-19</reference> The sum is, that "as by one
   man's disobedience many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one"
   (of one man, Jesus Christ, verse 15) "are many made righteous." The
   same nature that sinned must work out the reparation and recovery from
   sin. So he affirms again, <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.21">1 Corinthians 15:21</reference>, "For since by man came death,
   by man came also the resurrection of the dead." No otherwise could our
   ruin be retrieved, nor our deliverance from sin with all the
   consequents of it be effected, -- which came by man, which were
   committed and deserved in and by our nature, -- but by man, by one of
   the same nature with us. This, therefore, in the first place, became
   the wisdom of God, that the world of deliverance should be wrought in
   our own nature, -- in the nature that had sinned.
				</p><p>
   2. That part of human nature in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> or through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> this work was to be
   effected, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the essence or substance of it, was to be derived
   from the common root or stock of the same nature, in our first parents.
   It would not suffice to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> that God should create a man, out of the
   dust of the earth or out of nothing, of the same nature in general with
   ourselves; for there would be no cognation or alliance between him and
   us, so that we should be any way concerned in what he did or suffered:
   for this advance depends solely upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note>, that God " has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of one
   blood all nations of men," <reference osisRef="Acts.17.26">Acts 17:26</reference> Hence it is that the
   genealogy of Christ is given us in the Gospel -- not only from Abraham,
   to declare the faithfulness of God in the promise that he should be of
   his seed, but from Adam also, to manifest his relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the common
   stock of our nature, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all mankind in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   The first discovery of the wisdom of God in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> was in that primitive
   revelation, that the Deliverer should be of "the seed of the woman,"
   <reference osisRef="Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</reference> No other but he who was so could "break the serpent's
   head," or "destroy the work of the devil," so as that we might be
   delivered and restored. He was not only to be partaker of our nature,
   but he was so to be, by being "the seed of the woman," <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference> He
   was not to be created out of nothing, nor to be made of the dust of the
   earth, but so "made of a woman," as that thereby he might receive our
   nature from the common root and spring of it. Thus "he who sanctifies<note n="sanctifieth">Auto-modernized</note>
   and they who are sanctified are all of one," <reference osisRef="Heb.2.11">Hebrews 2:11</reference>, -- ex henos;
   that is, phuramatos -- of the same mass, of one nature and blood;
   from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he is not ashamed to call them brethren. This also was to be
   brought forth from the treasures of infinite wisdom.
				</p><p>
   3. This nature of ours, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the work of our recovery and salvation
   is to be wrought and performed, was not to be so derived from the
   original stock of our kind or race as to bring along with it the same
   taint of sin, and the same liableness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> guilt, upon its own account,
   as accompany every other individual person in the world; for, as the
   apostle speaks, "such a high priest became us" (and as a high priest
   was he to accomplish this work) "as was holy, harmless, undefiled,
   separate from sinners." For, if this nature in him were so defiled as
   it is in us -- if it were under a deprivation of the image of God, as
   it is in our persons before our renovation -- it could do nothing that
   should be acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And if it were subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> guilt on its
   own account, it could make no satisfaction for the sin of others. Here,
   therefore, again occurs dignus vindice nodus -- a difficulty which
   nothing but divine wisdom could expedite.
				</p><p>
   To take a little farther view of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, we must consider on what grounds
   these things (spiritual defilement and guilt) do adhere to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   nature, as they are in all our individual persons. And the first of
   these is -- that our entire nature, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our participation of it,
   was in Adam, as our head and representative. Hence his sin became the
   sin of us all -- is justly imputed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us and charged on us. In him we
   all sinned; all did so who were in him as their common representative
   when he sinned. Hereby we became the natural "children of wrath," or
   liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the wrath of God for the common sin of our nature, in the
   natural and legal head or spring of it. And the other is -- that we
   derive our nature from Adam by the way of natural generation. By that
   means alone is the nature of our first parents, as defiled,
   communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; for by this means do we become to appertain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the stock as it was degenerate and corrupt. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> that part of our
   nature in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> and through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> this great work was to be wrought, must, as
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its essence and substance, be derived from our first parents, --
   yet so as never to have been in Adam as a common representative, nor be
   derived from him by natural generation.
				</p><p>
   The bringing forth of our nature in such an instance -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it
   should relate no less really and truly to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the first Adam than we do
   ourselves, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> there is the strictest alliance of nature between
   him so partaker of it and us, yet so as not in the least to participate
   of the guilt of the first sin, nor of the defilement of our nature
   thereby -- must be an effect of infinite wisdom beyond the conceptions
   of any created understanding. And this, as we know, was done in the
   person of Christ; for his human nature was never in Adam as his
   representative, nor was he comprised in the covenant in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he stood.
   For he derived it legally only from and after the first promise, when
   Adam ceased to be a common person. Nor did it proceed from him by
   natural generation -- the only means of the derivation of its
   depravation and pollution; for it was a "holy thing," created in the
   womb of the Virgin by the power of the Most High. "O the depths of the
   wisdom and knowledge of God!"
				</p><p>
   It was necessary, therefore, on all these considerations -- it was so
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of the holy properties of the divine nature, and the
   reparation of the honour of his holiness and righteousness -- that he
   by whom the work of our recovery was to be wrought should be a man,
   partaker of the nature that sinned, yet free from all sin, and all the
   consequent of it. And this did divine wisdom contrive and accomplish in
   the human nature of Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   But yet, in the second place, on all the considerations before
   mentioned, it is no less evident that this work could not be wrought or
   effected by him who was no more than a mere man, who had no nature but
   ours -- who was a human person, and no more. There was no one act which
   he was to perform, in order to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our deliverance, but did require a
   divine power to render it efficacious. But in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> lies that great
   mystery of godliness to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> a continual opposition has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been made by
   the gates of hell; as we manifested in the entrance of this discourse.
   But whereas it belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the foundation of our faith, we must
   inquire into it, and confirm the truth of it with such demonstrations
   as divine revelation does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> accommodate us withal. And three things are
   to be spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   First, We are to give in rational evidences that the recovery of
   mankind was not to be effected by any one who was a mere man, and no
   more, though it were absolutely necessary that a man he should be; he
   must be God also. Secondly, We must inquire into the suitableness or
   condecency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom in the redemption and salvation of the
   church by Jesus Christ, who was God and man in one person; and upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>
   give a description of the person of Christ and its constitution, which
   suits<note n="suiteth">Auto-modernized</note> all the ends of infinite wisdom in this glorious work. The
   first of these falls under sundry plain demonstrations.
				</p><p>
   1. That human nature might be restored, or any portion of mankind be
   eternally saved to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God, it was necessary, as we proved
   before, that an obedience should be yielded to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God and his law, which
   should give and bring more glory and honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his holiness than
   there was dishonour reflected on it by the disobedience of us all.
   Those who are otherwise minded care not what becomes of the glory of
   God, so that wicked, sinful man may be saved one way or other. But
   these thoughts spring out of our apostasy, and belong not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that
   estate in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we loved God above all, and preferred his glory above
   all, -- as it was with us at the first, in the original constitution of
   our nature. But such an obedience could never be yielded to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by
   any mere creature whatever; -- not by any one who was only a man,
   however dignified and exalted in state and condition above all others.
   For to suppose that God should be pleased and glorified with the
   obedience of any one man, more than he was displeased and dishonored by
   the disobedience of Adam and all his posterity, is to fancy things that
   have no ground in reason or justice, or are any way suitable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   divine wisdom and holiness. He who undertakes<note n="undertaketh">Auto-modernized</note> this work must have
   somewhat that is divine and infinite, to put an infinite value on his
   obedience -- that is, he must be God.
				</p><p>
   2. The obedience of such a one, of a mere man, could have no influence
   at all on the recovery of mankind, nor the salvation of the church.
   For, whatever it were, it would be all due from him for himself, and so
   could only profit or benefit himself; for what is due from any on his
   own account, cannot redound or be reckoned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the advantage of
   another. But there is no mere creature, nor can there be any such, but
   he is obliged for himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God that he is
   capable of the performance of in this world; as we have before
   declared. Yea, universal obedience, in all possible instances, is so
   absolutely necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, as a creature made in dependence on God,
   and for the enjoyment of him, that the voluntary omission of it, in any
   one instance, would be a criminal disobedience, ruinous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own
   soul. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, no such obedience could be accepted as any kind of
   compensation for the disobedience of others, or in their stead. He,
   then, that performs this obedience must be one who was not originally
   obliged to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, on his own account, or for himself. And this must be
   a divine person, and none other; for every mere creature is so obliged.
   And there is nothing more fundamental in Gospel principles, than that
   the Lord Christ, in his divine person, was above the law, and for
   himself owed no obedience to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; but by his own condescension, as
   he was "made of a woman" for us, so he was "made under the law" for us.
   And therefore, those by whom the divine person of Christ is denied, do
   all of them contend that he yielded obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God for himself, and
   not for us. But in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> they bid defiance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the principal effect of
   divine wisdom, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God will be eternally glorified.
				</p><p>
   3. The people to be freed, redeemed, and brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> glory, were great
   and innumerable; "a great multitude, which no man can number," <reference osisRef="Rev.7.9">Revelation of John 7:9</reference> The sins which they were to be delivered, ransomed, and
   justified from -- for which a propitiation was to be made -- were next
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> absolutely infinite. They wholly surpass the comprehension of any
   created understanding, or the compass of imagination. And in every one
   of them there was something reductively infinite, as committed against
   an infinite Majesty. The miseries which upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> all these persons were
   obnoxious to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> were infinite, because eternal; or all that evil which
   our nature is capable to suffer was by them all eternally to be
   undergone.
				</p><p>
   By all these persons, in all these sins, there was an inroad made on
   the rule and government of God, an affront given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his justice, in
   the violation of his law; nor can any of them be delivered from the
   consequent of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> in eternal misery, without a compensation and
   satisfaction made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the justice of God. To assert the contrary, is
   to suppose, that upon the matter it is all one to him whether he be
   obeyed or disobeyed, whether he be honoured or dishonored, in and by
   his creatures; and this is all one as to deny his very being, seeing it
   opposes<note n="opposeth">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of his essential properties. Now, to suppose that a
   mere man, by his temporary suffering of external pains, should make
   satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the justice of God for all the sins of all these
   persons, so as it should be right and just with him not only to save
   and deliver them from all the evils they were liable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, but also to
   bring them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> life and glory, is to constitute a mediation between
   God and man that should consist in appearance and ostentation, and not
   be an effect of divine wisdom, righteousness, and holiness, nor have
   its foundation in the nature and equity of things themselves. For the
   things supposed will not be reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any rules of justice or
   proportion, that one of them should be conceived in any sense to answer
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the other, that is, there is nothing which answers any rule,
   notions, or conceptions of justice -- nothing that might be exemplary
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men in the punishment of crimes -- that the sins of an infinite
   number of men, deserving every one of them eternal death, should be
   expiated by the temporary sufferings of one mere man, so as to
   demonstrate the righteousness of God in the punishment of sin. But God
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not do these things for show or appearance, but according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   real exigence of the holy properties of his nature. And on that
   supposition, there must be a proportion between the things themselves
   -- namely, the sufferings of one and the deliverance of all.
				</p><p>
   Nor could the faith of man ever find a stable foundation to fix upon on
   the supposition before mentioned. No faith is able to conflict with
   this objection, that the sufferings of one mere man should be accepted
   with God as a just compensation for the sins of the whole church. Men
   who, in things of this nature, satisfy themselves with notions and
   fancies, may digest such suppositions; but those who make use of faith
   for their own delivery from under a conviction of sin, the nature and
   demerit of it, with a sense of the wrath of God, and the curse of the
   law against it, can find no relief in such notions or apprehensions.
   But it became the wisdom of God, in the dispensation of himself in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, so to order things as that faith might have an
   immovable rock to build upon. This alone it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in the person of
   Christ, God and man, his obedience and sufferings. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, those by
   whom the divine nature of the Lord Christ is denied, do all of them
   absolutely deny also that he made any satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine justice
   for sin. They will rather swallow all the absurdities which the
   absolute dismission of sin without satisfaction or punishment does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   bring along with it, than grant that a mere man could make any such
   satisfaction by his temporary sufferings for the sins of the world.
   And, on the other hand, whoever does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> truly and sincerely believe the
   divine person of Christ -- namely, that he was God and man in one
   person, and as such a person acted in the whole work of mediation -- he
   cannot shut his eyes against the glorious light of this truth, that
   what he did and suffered in that work must have an intrinsic worth and
   excellency in it, out-balancing all the evil in the sins of mankind --
   that more honour and glory accrued to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the holiness and law of God by
   his obedience than dishonour was cast on them by the disobedience of
   Adam and all his posterity.
				</p><p>
   4. The way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the church was to be recovered and saved, was by
   such works and acting as one should take on himself to perform in the
   way of an office committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for that end. For whereas man could
   not recover, ransom, nor save himself as we have proved, the whole must
   be wrought for him by another. The undertaking of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> by another must
   depend on the infinite wisdom, counsel, and pleasure of God, with the
   will and consent of him who was to undertake it. So also did the
   constitution of the way and means in particular through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> this
   deliverance was to be wrought. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> it became his office to do the
   things which were required to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end. But we have before proved,
   apart by itself, that no office to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this purpose could be discharged
   towards God, or the whole church, by any one who was a man only. I
   shall not, therefore, here farther insist upon it, although there be
   good argument in it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our present purpose.
				</p><p>
   5. If man be recovered, he must be restored into the same state,
   condition, and dignity, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was placed before the fall. To
   restore him with any diminution of honour and blessedness was not
   suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom and bounty; yea, seeing it was the infinite
   grace, goodness, and mercy of God to restore him, it seems agreeable
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of divine excellencies in their operations, that he
   should be brought into a better and more honourable condition than that
   which he had lost. But before the fall, man was not subject nor
   obedient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any but to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God alone. Somewhat less he was in dignity
   than the angels; nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> he owed them no obedience -- they were his
   fellow-servants. And as for all other things here below, they were made
   "subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and put under his feet," he himself being in
   subjection to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God alone. But if he were deemed and restored by one
   who was a mere creature, he could not be restored to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this state and
   dignity; for, on all grounds of right and equity, he must owe all
   service and obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by whom he was redeemed, restored, and
   recovered, as the author of the state in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is. For when we are
   "bought with a price," we are not our own, as the apostle affirms, <reference osisRef="1Cor.6.19 1Cor.6.20">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</reference> We are therefore his who has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> bought us; and him are
   we bound to serve in our souls and bodies, which are his. Accordingly,
   in the purchase of us, the Lord Christ became our absolute Lord, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   whom we owe all religious subjection of soul and conscience, <reference osisRef="Rom.14.7 Rom.14.8 Rom.14.9">Romans 14:7-9</reference> It would follow, therefore, that if we were redeemed and recovered
   by the interposition of a mere creature -- if such a one were our
   Redeemer, Saviour, and Deliverer -- into the service of a mere creature
   (that is, religious service and obedience) we should be recovered. And
   so they believe who affirm the Lord Christ to be a man, and no more.
   But, on this supposition, we are so far from an advancement in state
   and dignity by our restoration, that we do not recover what we were
   first instated in. For it belonged to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> that we should owe
   religious service and obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him alone who was God by nature
   over all, blessed for ever. And they bring all confusion into Christian
   religion, who make a mere creature the object of our faith, love,
   adoration, invocation, and all sacred worship. But in our present
   restoration we are made subject anew, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> religious service, only
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God alone. Therefore the holy angels, the head of the creation, do
   openly disclaim any such service and veneration from us, because they
   are only the fellow-servants of them that have the testimony of Jesus,
   <reference osisRef="Rev.19.10">Revelation of John 19:10</reference> Nor has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> God put the "world to come," the gospel state of
   the church, into subjection to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> angels, or any other creature, but
   only to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son, who is Lord over his own house, even he that made
   all things, who is God, <reference osisRef="Heb.3.4 Heb.3.5 Heb.3.6">Hebrews 3:4-6</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, we are restored into
   our primitive condition, to be in spiritual subjection to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God alone.
   He, therefore, by whom we are restored, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom we owe all obedience
   and religious service, is, and ought to be, God also. And as they
   utterly overthrow the gospel who affirm that all the obedience of it is
   due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who is a man, and no more -- as do all by whom the divine
   nature of Christ is denied; so they debase themselves beneath the
   dignity of the state of redemption, and cast dishonour on the mediation
   of Christ, who subject themselves in any religious service to saints or
   angels, or any other creatures whatever.
				</p><p>
   On these suppositions, which are full of light and evidence, infinite
   Wisdom did interpose itself, to glorify all the other concerned
   excellencies of the glory of God, in such a way as might solve all
   difficulties, and satisfy all the ends of God's glory, in the recovery
   and redemption of mankind. The case before it was as follows<note n="followeth">Auto-modernized</note>: 
				</p><p>
   Man, by sin, had cast the most inconceivable dishonour on the
   righteousness, holiness, goodness, and rule of God; and himself into
   the guilt of eternal ruin. In this state it became the wisdom and
   goodness of God, neither to suffer the whole race of mankind to come
   short eternally of that enjoyment of himself for which it was created,
   nor yet to deliver any one of them without a retrieval of the eternal
   honour of his righteousness, holiness, and rule, from the diminution
   and waste that was made of it by sin. As this could no way be done but
   by a full satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> justice and an obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law,
   bringing and yielding more honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the holiness and righteousness
   of God than they could any way lose by the sin and disobedience of man;
   -- so this satisfaction must be made, and this obedience be yielded, in
   and by the same nature that sinned or disobeyed, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> alone the
   residue of mankind may be interested in the benefits and effects of
   that obedience and satisfaction. Yet was it necessary to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, that
   the nature in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> all this was to be performed, though derived from
   the same common stock with that of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> in all our persons we are
   partakers, should be absolutely free from the contagion and guilt
   which, with it and by it, are communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our persons from that
   common stock. Unless it were so, there could be no undertaking in it
   for others -- it would not be able to answer for itself. But yet, on
   all these suppositions, no undertaking, no performance of duty, in
   human nature, could possibly yield that obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, or make
   that satisfaction for sin, whereon the deliverance of others might
   ensue, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of the holiness, righteousness, and rule of God.
				</p><p>
   In this state of things did infinite Wisdom interpose itself, in that
   glorious, ineffable contrivance of the person of Christ -- or of the
   divine nature in the eternal Son of God and of ours in the same
   individual person. Otherwise this work could not be accomplished; -- at
   least all other ways are hidden from the eyes of all living, no created
   understanding being able to apprehend any other way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it might so
   have been, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal glory of God. This, therefore, is such an
   effect of divine wisdom as will be the object of holy adoration and
   admiration to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity; -- as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this life, how little a portion is
   it we know of its excellency!

<title>Chapter 17 Other Evidences of Divine Wisdom in the Contrivance of the Work of Redemption in and by the Person of Christ, in Effects Evidencing a Condecency to that.</title>
<p>   That which remains of our present inquiry, is concerning those
   evidences of divine condecency, or suitableness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> infinite wisdom
   and goodness, which we may gather from the nature of this work, and its
   effects as expressed in divine revelation. Some few instances of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> I
   shall choose out from amongst many that might be insisted on.
				</p><p>
   1. Man was made to serve God in all things. In his person -- in his
   soul and body -- in all his faculties, powers, and senses -- all that
   was given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him or intrusted with him -- he was not his own, but
   every way a servant, in all that he was in all that he had, in all that
   he did or was to do. This he was made for -- this state and condition
   was necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him as a creature. It could be no otherwise with any
   that was so; it was so with the angels, who were greater in dignity and
   power than man. The very name of creature includes the condition of
   universal subjection and service to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Creator. This condition, in
   and by his sin, Adam designed to desert and to free himself from. He
   would exalt himself out of the state of service and obedience absolute
   and universal, into a condition of self-sufficiency -- of domination
   and rule. He would be as God, like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God; that is, subject no more
   to him, be in no more dependence on him -- but advance his own will
   above the will of God. And there is somewhat of this in every sin; --
   the sinner would advance his own will in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and above the
   will of God. But what was the event of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>? Man, by endeavouring to
   free himself from absolute subjection and universal service, to invade
   absolute dominion, fell into absolute and eternal ruin.
				</p><p>
   For our recovery out of this state and condition, considering how we
   cast ourselves into it, the way insisted on was found out by divine
   wisdom -- namely, the incarnation of the Son of God; for he was Lord of
   all, had absolute dominion over all, owed no service, no obedience for
   himself -- being in the form of God, and equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. From this
   state of absolute dominion he descended into a condition of absolute
   service. As Adam sinned and fell by leaving that state of absolute
   service which was due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, proper to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his nature, inseparable
   from it, -- to attempt a state of absolute dominion which was not his
   own, not due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, not consistent with his nature; so the Son of
   God, being made the second Adam, relieved us by descending from a state
   of absolute dominion, which was his own -- due to his nature -- to take
   on him a state of absolute service, which was not his own, nor due to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him. And this being inconsistent with his own divine nature, he
   performed it by taking our nature on him -- making it his own. He
   descended as much beneath himself in his self-humiliation, as Adam
   designed to ascend above himself in his pride and self-exaltation.
				</p><p>
   The consideration of the divine grace and wisdom in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle
   proposes<note n="proposeth">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:6-8</reference>, "Who, being in the form of God,
   thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no
   reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in
   the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
   himself, and became obedient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> death, even the death of the cross."
   Adam being in the form -- that is, the state and condition -- of a
   servant, did by robbery attempt to take upon him the "form of God," or
   to make himself equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. The Lord Christ being in the "form of
   God" -- that is, his essential form, of the same nature with him --
   accounted it no robbery to be in the state and condition of God, to be
   "equal to him;" but being made in the "fashion of a man," taking on him
   our nature, he also submitted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the form or the state and condition
   of a servant in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. He had dominion over all, owed service and
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> none, being in the "form of God," and equal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him --
   the condition which Adam aspired to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; but he condescended to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a state
   of absolute subjection and service for our recovery. This did no more
   belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him on his own account, than it belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Adam to be
   like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, or equal to him. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> it is said that he humbled
   himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, as Adam would have exalted himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a state of
   dignity which was not his due.
				</p><p>
   This submission of the Son of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> an estate of absolute and
   universal service is declared by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.5">Hebrews 10:5</reference> For those
   words of the Psalmist, "Mine ears hast thou digged," or bored, <reference osisRef="Ps.40.6">Psalms 40:6</reference>, he renders, "A body hast thou prepared me." There is an allusion in
   the words of the prophecy to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him under the law who gave up himself in
   absolute and perpetual service; in sign of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> his ears were bored
   with an awl. So the body of Christ was prepared for him, that in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>
   he might be in a state of absolute service to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. So he became to
   have nothing of his own -- the original state that Adam would have
   forsaken; no, not [even] his life -- he was obedient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the death.
				</p><p>
   This way did divine wisdom find out and contrive, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> more glory
   did arise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the holiness and righteousness of God from his
   condescension to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> universal service and obedience who was over all,
   God blessed for ever, than dishonour was cast upon them by the
   self-exaltation of him who, being in all things a servant, designed to
   be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
				</p><p>
   2. Adam was poor in himself, as a creature must be. What riches he had
   in his hand or power, they were none of his own, they were only trusted
   with him for special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> service. In this state of poverty he commits the
   robbery of attempting to be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. Being poor, he would make
   himself rich by the rapine of an equality with God. This brought on him
   and us all, as it was meet it should, the loss of all that we were
   trusted with. Hereby we lost the image of God -- lost our right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the creatures here below -- lost ourselves and our souls. This was the
   issue of his attempt to be rich when he was poor.
				</p><p>
   In this state infinite wisdom has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided for our relief, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   glory of God. For the Lord Jesus Christ being rich in himself, for our
   sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich, <reference osisRef="2Cor.8.9">2 Corinthians 8:9</reference> He was rich in that riches which Adam designed by robbery; for
   "he was in the form of God, and accounted it no robbery to be equal
   with God." But he made himself poor for our sakes, with poverty which
   Adam would have relinquished; yea, to that degree that "he had not
   where to lay his head" -- he had nothing. Hereby he made a compensation
   for what he never made spoil of, or paid what he never took. In this
   condescension of his, out of grace and love to mankind, was God more
   glorified than he was dishonored in the sinful exaltation of Adam out
   of pride and self-love.
				</p><p>
   3. The sin of man consisted formally in disobedience; and it was the
   disobedience of him who was every way and in all things obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   obedience. For man -- by all that he was, by all that he had received,
   by all that he expected or was farther capable of, by the constitution
   of his own nature, by the nature and authority of God, with his
   relation to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> -- was indispensably obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> universal
   obedience. His sin, therefore, was the disobedience of him who was
   absolutely obliged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience by the very constitution of his being
   and necessary relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. This was that which rendered it so
   exceeding sinful, and the consequents of it eternally miserable; and
   from this obligation his sin, in any one instance, was a total
   renunciation of all obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
				</p><p>
   The recompense, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God, for disobedience
   must be by obedience, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been before declared. And if there be not
   a full obedience yielded to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the law of God in that nature that
   sinned, man cannot be saved without an eternal violation of the glory
   of God in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. But the disobedience of him who was every way obliged
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience could not be compensated but by his obedience who was no
   way obliged to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; and this could be only the obedience of him that
   is God, (for all creatures are obliged to obedience for themselves,)
   and it could be performed only by him who was man. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, for the
   accomplishment of this obedience, he who, in his own person as God, was
   above the law, was in his human nature, in his own person as man, made
   under the law. Had he not been made under the law, what he did could
   not have been obedience; and had he not been in himself above the law,
   his obedience could not have been beneficial to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. The sin of Adam
   (and the same is in the nature of every sin) consisted in this -- that
   he who was naturally every way under the law, and subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it,
   would be every way above the law, and no way obliged by it. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>
   it was taken away, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God, by his obedience, who being
   in himself above the law, no way subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, yet submitted,
   humbled himself, to be "made under the law," to be every way obliged by
   it. See <reference osisRef="Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</reference>, <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference> This is the subject of the discourse of
   the apostle, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.12 Rom.5.13 Rom.5.14 Rom.5.15 Rom.5.16 Rom.5.17 Rom.5.18 Rom.5.19 Rom.5.20 Rom.5.21">Romans 5:12-21</reference>
				</p><p>
   To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God in all these ends, the person of Christ, as an
   effect of infinite wisdom, was meet and able to be a mediator and
   undertaker between God and man. In the union of both our natures in the
   same person he was so meet by his relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> both; -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by
   filiation, or sonship; to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by brotherhood, or nearness of kindred,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14">Hebrews 2:14</reference> And he was able from the dignity of his person; for the
   temporary sufferings of him who was eternal were a full compensation
   for the eternal sufferings of them who were temporary.
				</p><p>
   4. God made man the lord of all things here below. He was, as it were,
   the heir of God, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the inheritance of this world in present, and
   as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a blessed state in eternal glory. But he lost all right and
   title to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> by sin. He made forfeiture of the whole by the law of
   tenure through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he held it, and God took the forfeiture. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he
   designs a new heir of all, and vests the whole inheritance of heaven
   and earth in him, even in his Son. He appointed him "the heir of all
   things," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.2">Hebrews 1:2</reference> This translation of God's inheritance the apostle
   declares, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.6 Heb.2.7 Heb.2.8 Heb.2.9">Hebrews 2:6-9</reference>; for the words which he cites from <reference osisRef="Ps.8.4 Ps.8.5 Ps.8.6">Psalms 8:4-6</reference>, -- "What is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man,
   that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the
   angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to
   have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things
   under his feet," -- do declare the original condition of mankind in
   general. But man forfeited the dominion and inheritance that he was
   intrusted withal; and God settles<note n="settleth">Auto-modernized</note> it anew, solely in the man Christ
   Jesus. So the apostle adds, "We see not yet all things put under him;"
   but we see it all accomplished in Jesus, verse 8. But as all other
   inheritances do descend with theirs, so did this to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him with its
   burden. There was a great debt upon it -- the debt of sin. This he was
   to undergo, to make payment of, or satisfaction for, or he could not
   rightly enter upon the inheritance. This could no otherwise be done but
   by his suffering in our nature, as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been declared. He who was the
   heir of all, was in himself to purge our sins. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> did the infinite
   wisdom of God manifest itself, in that he conveyed the inheritance of
   all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him who was meet and able so to enter upon it, so to
   enjoy and possess it, as that no detriment or damage might arise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the riches, the revenue, the glory of God, from the waste made by the
   former possessor.
				</p><p>
   5. Mankind was to be recovered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faith and trust in God, as also
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the love of him above all. All these things had utterly forsaken
   our nature; and the reduction of them into it is a work of the greatest
   difficulty. We had so provoked God, he had given such evidences of his
   wrath and displeasure against us, and our minds upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> were so
   alienated from him, as we stood in need of the strongest motives and
   highest encouragements once to attempt to return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, so as to
   place all our faith and trust in him, and all our love upon him.
				</p><p>
   Sinners generally live in a neglect and contempt of God, in an enmity
   against him; but whenever they are convinced of a necessity to
   endeavour a return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, the first thing they have to conflict
   withal is fear. Beginning to understand who and what he is, as also how
   things stand between him and them, they are afraid to have anything to
   do with him, and judge it impossible that they should find acceptance
   with him. This was the sense that Adam himself had upon his sin, when
   he was afraid, and hid himself. And the sense of other sinners is
   frequently expressed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same purpose in Scripture. See <reference osisRef="Isa.33.14">Isaiah 33:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Mic.6.6 Mic.6.7">Micah 6:6-7</reference>
				</p><p>
   All these discouragements are absolutely provided against in that way
   of our recovery which infinite wisdom has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> found out. It were a thing
   delightful to dwell on the securities given us in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   acceptance, in all those principles, acts, and duties in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   renovation of the image of God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist. I must contract my
   meditations, and shall therefore instance in some few things only to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   that purpose.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Faith is not capable of greater encouragement or confirmation than
   lies<note n="lieth">Auto-modernized</note> in this one consideration -- that what we are to believe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   this end is delivered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us by God himself in our nature. What could
   confirm our faith and hope in God, what could encourage us to expect
   acceptance with God, like this ineffable testimony of his goodwill to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us? The nature of things is not capable of greater assurance, seeing
   the divine nature is capable of no greater condescension.
				</p><p>
   This the Scripture proposes<note n="proposeth">Auto-modernized</note> as that which gives a just expectation
   that, against all fears and oppositions, we should close with divine
   calls and invitations to return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God: "Last of all he sent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them his son, saying, They will reverence my son," <reference osisRef="Matt.21.37">Matthew 21:37</reference>, --
   they will believe the message which I send by him. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> "spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us by his Son" -- "the brightness of his glory, and the express image
   of his person," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.1 Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:1-3</reference> The consideration of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is sufficient to
   dispel all that darkness and confusion which fear, dread, and guilt do
   bring on the minds of men, when they are invited to return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
   That that God against whom we have sinned should speak to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and
   treat with us, in our own nature, about a return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, is the
   utmost that divine excellencies could condescend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. And as this was
   needful for us, (though proud men and senseless of sin understand it
   not,) so, if it be refused, it will be attended with the sorest
   destruction, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.25">Hebrews 12:25</reference>
				</p><p>
   (2.) This treaty principally consists in a divine declaration, that all
   the causes of fear and dread upon the account of sin are removed and
   taken away. This is the substance of the Gospel, as it is declared by
   the apostle, <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.18 2Cor.5.19 2Cor.5.20 2Cor.5.21">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, if upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> we refuse to return
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God -- to make him the object of our faith, trust, love, and
   delight -- it is not by reason of any old or former sin, not of that of
   our original apostasy from God, nor of the effects of it against the
   law, [but] by the means of a new sin, outdoing them all in guilt and
   contempt of God. Such is final unbelief against the proposal of the
   Gospel. It has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> more malignity in it than all other sins whatever. But
   by this way of our recovery, all cause of fear and dread is taken away
   -- all pretences of a distrust of the love and good-will of God are
   defeated; so that if men will not upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> be recovered to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, it is
   from their hatred of him and enmity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him -- the fruits of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> they
   must feed on to eternity.
				</p><p>
   (3.) Whereas, if we will return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by faith, we are also to
   return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in love, what greater motive can there be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it than
   that infinite love of the Father and the Son to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, which is
   gloriously displayed in this way of our recovery? See <reference osisRef="1John.4.9 1John.4.10">1 John 4:9-10</reference>
   "Si amare pigebat, saltem redamare ne pigeat."
				</p><p>
   (4.) The whole race of mankind falling into sin against God, and
   apostasy from him, there was no example left to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them to manifest how
   excellent, how glorious and comely a thing it is, to live to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, --
   to believe and trust in him -- to cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him unchangeably by love;
   for they were utter strangers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what is done by angels above, nor
   could be affected with their example. But without a pattern of these
   things, manifesting their excellency and reward, they could not
   earnestly endeavour to attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. This is given us most
   conspicuously in the human nature of Christ. See <reference osisRef="Heb.12.2 Heb.12.3">Hebrews 12:2-3</reference>
   Hereby, therefore, everything needful for our encouragement to return
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God is, in infinite wisdom, provided for and proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   6. Divine Wisdom, in the way of our recovery by Jesus Christ, God
   manifest in the flesh, designed to glorify a state of obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, and to cast the reproach of the most inexpressible folly on the
   relinquishing<note n="relinquishment">Auto-modernized</note> of that state by sin. For, as God would recover and
   restore us; so he would do it in a way of obedience on our part -- of
   that obedience which we had forsaken. The design of man, which was
   imposed on him by the craft of Satan, was to become wise like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God,
   knowing good and evil. The folly of this endeavour was quickly
   discovered in its effects. Sense of nakedness, with shame, misery, and
   death, immediately ensued upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   But divine Wisdom thought meet to aggravate the reproach of this folly.
   He would let us see in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the true knowledge of good and evil did
   consist, and how foolishly we had aspired to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it by a relinquishing<note n="relinquishment">Auto-modernized</note>
   of that state of obedience in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we were created.
				</p><p>
   Job xxviii. from verse 12 to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of the chapter, there is an
   inquiry after wisdom, and the place of its habitation. All creatures
   give an account that it is not in them, that it is hid from them --
   only they have heard the fame of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. All the context is to evince
   that it is essentially and originally only in God himself. But if we
   cannot comprehend it in itself, yet may we not know what is wisdom to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, and what is required to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>? Yes, says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he; for "to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> man he
   said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from
   evil is understanding," verse 28. Man, on the other hand, by the
   suggestion of Satan, thought, and now of himself continues to think,
   otherwise; namely, that the way to be wise is to relinquish these
   things. The world will not be persuaded that "the fear of the Lord is
   wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding;" yea, there is
   nothing that the most of men do more despise and scorn, than thoughts
   that true wisdom does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist in faith, love, fear, and obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God. See <reference osisRef="Ps.14.6">Psalms 14:6</reference> Whatever else may be pleaded to be in it, yet sure
   enough they are that those who count it wisdom are but fools.
				</p><p>
   To cast an everlasting reproach of folly on this contrivance of the
   devil and man, and uncontrollably to evince in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> alone true wisdom
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist, God would glorify a state of obedience. He would render
   it incomparably more amiable, desirable, and excellent, than ever it
   could have appeared to have been in the obedience of all the angels in
   heaven and men on earth, had they continued in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. This he did in
   this way of our recovery, -- in that his own eternal Son entered into a
   state of obedience, and took upon him the "form" or condition "of a
   servant" to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
				</p><p>
   What more evident conviction could there be of the folly of mankind in
   hearkening to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the suggestion of Satan to seek after wisdom in another
   condition? How could that great maxim, which is laid down in opposition
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all vain thoughts of man, be more eminently exemplified -- that
   "the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil, that is
   understanding?" What greater evidence could be given, that the nature
   of man is not capable of a better condition than that of service and
   universal obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God? How could any state be represented more
   amiable, desirable, and blessed? In the obedience of Christ, of the Son
   of God in our nature, apostate sinners are upbraided with their folly
   in relinquishing that state which, by his susception of it, is rendered
   so glorious. What have we attained by leaving that condition which the
   eternal Son of God delighted in? "I delight," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "to do thy
   will, O my God; yea, thy law is in the midst of my bowels," <reference osisRef="Ps.40.8">Psalms 40:8</reference>
   -- margin. It is the highest demonstration that our nature is not
   capable of more order, more beauty, more glory, than consists in
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. And that state which we fell into upon our
   forsaking of it, we now know to be all darkness, confusion, and misery.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, seeing God, in infinite grace and mercy, would recover us
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself; and, in his righteousness and holiness, would do this in
   a way of obedience, -- of that obedience which we had forsaken; it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   an eminent impression of divine wisdom upon it, that in this mystery of
   God manifest in the flesh, the only means of our recovery, he would
   cast the reproach of the most inexpressible folly on our apostasy from
   a state of it, and render it amiable and desirable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all who are to
   return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
				</p><p>
   To bear the shame of this folly, to be deeply sensible of it, and to
   live in a constant prospect and view of the glory of obedience in the
   person of Christ, with a sedulous endeavour for conformity to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>,
   is the highest attainment of our wisdom in this world; -- and whosoever
   is otherwise minded, is so at his own utmost peril.
				</p><p>
   7. God, in infinite wisdom, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> by this means secured the whole
   inheritance of this life and that which is to come from a second
   forfeiture. Whatever God will bestow on the children of men, he grants
   it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them in the way of an inheritance. So the land of Canaan,
   chosen out for a representative of spiritual and eternal things, was
   granted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Abraham and his seed for an inheritance. And his interest
   in the promise is expressed by being "heir of the world." All the
   things of this life, that are really good and useful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, do belong
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this inheritance. So they did when it was vested in Adam. All
   things of grace and glory do so also. And the whole of the privilege of
   believers is, that they are heirs of salvation. Hence godliness has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   the "promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come," <reference osisRef="1Tim.4.8">1 Timothy 4:8</reference> And the promise is only of the inheritance. This
   inheritance, as was before intimated, was lost in Adam, and forfeited
   into the hand of the great Lord, the great possessor of heaven and
   earth. In his sovereign grace and goodness he was pleased again to
   restore it -- as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the benefits of it -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the former
   tenants; and that with an addition of grace, and a more exceeding
   weight of glory. But withal, infinite wisdom provides that a second
   forfeiture shall not be made of it. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the grant of it is not
   made immediately to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any of those for whose use and benefit it is
   prepared and granted. They had been once tried, and failed in their
   trust, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their own eternal beggary and ruin, had not infinite grace
   interposed for their relief. And it did not become the wisdom and glory
   of God to make a second grant of it, which might be frustrate in like
   manner. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he would not commit it again to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any mere creature
   whatever; nor would it safely have been so done with security to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   glory. For --
				</p><p>
   (1.) It was too great a trust -- even the whole inheritance of heaven
   and earth, all the riches of grace and glory -- to be committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   any one of them. God would not give this glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any one creature.
   If it be said it was first committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Adam, and therefore to have
   it again is not an honour above the capacity of a creature; I say that
   the nature of the inheritance is greatly changed. The whole of what was
   intrusted with Adam comes exceedingly short of what God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> now
   prepared as the inheritance of the church. There is grace in it, and
   glory added to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, which Adam neither had nor could have right to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>.
   It is now of that nature, as could neither be intrusted with, nor
   communicated by, any mere creature. Besides, he that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it is the
   object of the faith and trust of the church; nor can any be interested
   in any part of this inheritance without the exercise of those and all
   other graces on him whose the inheritance is. And so to be the object
   of our faith, is the prerogative of the divine nature alone.
				</p><p>
   (2.) No mere creature could secure this inheritance that it should be
   lost no more; and yet if it were so, it would be highly derogatory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the glory of God. For two things were required to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, -- First, That
   he in whom this trust is vested should be in himself incapable of any
   such failure, as through which, by the immutable, eternal law of
   obedience to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, a forfeiture of it should be made; -- Secondly,
   That he undertake for them all who shall be heirs of salvation, who
   shall enjoy this inheritance, that none of them should lose or forfeit
   their own personal interest in it, or the terms whereon it is conveyed
   and communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. But no mere creature was sufficient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   these ends; for no one of them, in and by him in the constitution of
   his nature, is absolutely free from falling from God, himself. They may
   receive -- the angels in heaven and the glorified saints have received
   -- such a confirmation, in and by grace, as that they shall never
   actually apostatize or fall from God; but this they have not from
   themselves, nor the principles of their own nature, -- which is
   necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that shall receive this trust. For so when it was
   first vested in Adam, he was left to preserve it by the innate
   concreated abilities of his own nature. And as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the latter, all the
   angels in heaven cannot undertake to secure the obedience of any one
   man, so as that the conveyance of the inheritance may be sure to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, with respect to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, those angels themselves though the
   most holy and glorious of all the creatures of God, have no greater
   trust or interest than to be "ministering spirits, sent forth to
   minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.14">Hebrews 1:14</reference> So
   unmeet are they to have the whole inheritance vested in any of them.
				</p><p>
   But all this infinite wisdom has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided for in the great "mystery of
   godliness God manifest in the flesh." God in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> makes his only Son the
   heir of all things, and vests the whole inheritance absolutely in him.
   For the promise, which is the court-roll of heaven -- the only external
   mean and record of its conveyance -- was originally made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ
   only. God said not, "And to seeds as of many; but as of one, And to thy
   seed, which is Christ," <reference osisRef="Gal.3.16">Galatians 3:16</reference> And we become again heirs of God
   only as we are joint heirs with Christ, <reference osisRef="Rom.8.17">Romans 8:17</reference>; that is by being
   taken into a participation of that inheritance which is vested in him
   alone. For many may be partakers of the benefit of that whose right and
   title is in one alone, when it is conveyed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for their use. And
   hereby the ends before mentioned are fully provided for. For --
				</p><p>
   [1.] He who is thus made the "heir of all" is meet to be intrusted with
   the glory of it. For where this grant is solemnly expressed, it is
   declared that he is the "brightness of the Father's glory, and the
   express image of his person," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.2 Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:2-3</reference>; and that by him the worlds
   were made. He alone was meet to be this heir who is partaker of the
   divine nature, and by whom all things were created; for such things
   belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it as cannot appertain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any other. The reader may
   consult, if he please, our exposition of that place of the apostle.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Any failure in his own person was absolutely impossible. The
   subsistence of the human nature in the person of the Son of God,
   rendered the least sin utterly impossible to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him; for all the moral
   operations of that nature are the acts of the person of the Son of God.
   And hereby not only is the inheritance secured but also an assurance
   that it is so is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all them that do believe. This is the life
   and soul of all Gospel comforts, that the whole inheritance of grace
   and glory is vested in Christ, where it can never suffer loss or
   damage. When we are sensible of the want of grace, should we go to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, and say, "Father, give us the portion of goods that falls to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us," as the prodigal did, we should quickly consume it, and bring
   ourselves to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the utmost misery, as he did also. But in Christ the
   whole inheritance is secured for evermore.
				</p><p>
   [3.] He is able to preserve all those who shall be heirs of this
   inheritance, that they forfeit not their own personal interest in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>,
   according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the terms of the covenant through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it is made over to
   them. He can and will, by the power of his grace, preserve them all
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the full enjoyment of the purchased inheritance. We hold our title
   by the rod -- at the will of the Lord; and many failures we are liable
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, whereon we are "in misericordia Domini," and are subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   amercements. But yet the whole inheritance being granted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ is
   eternally secured for us, and we are by his grace preserved from such
   offences against the supreme Lord, or committing any such wastes, as
   should cast us out of our possession. See <reference osisRef="Ps.89.27 Ps.89.28 Ps.89.29 Ps.89.30 Ps.89.31 Ps.89.32">Psalms 89:27-32</reference> Thus in
   all things infinite wisdom has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> provided that no second forfeiture
   should be made of the inheritance of grace and glory, which as it would
   have been eternally ruinous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mankind, so it was inconsistent with
   the glory and honour of God.
				</p><p>
   8. The wisdom of God was gloriously exalted in the righteous
   destruction of Satan and his interest, by the incarnation and mediation
   of the Son of God. He had prevailed against the first way of the
   manifestation of divine glory; and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> both pleased and prided
   himself. Nothing could ever give such satisfaction to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the malicious
   murderer, as the breach he had occasioned between God and man, with his
   hopes and apprehensions that it would be eternal. He had no other
   thoughts but that the whole race of mankind, which God had designed
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of himself, should be everlastingly ruined. So he
   had satisfied his envy against man in his eternal destruction with
   himself, and his malice against God in depriving him of his glory.
   Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note>, upon the distance that he had made between God and man, he
   interposed himself, and boasted himself for a long season as "The god
   of this world," who had all power over it and in it. It belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the honour of the wisdom of God that he should be defeated in this
   triumph. Neither was it meet that this should be done by a mere act of
   sovereign omnipotent power; for he would yet glory in his craft and the
   success of it, -- that there was no way to disappoint him, but by
   crushing him with power, without respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> righteousness or
   demonstration of wisdom. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, it must be done in such a way as
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he might see, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his eternal shame and confusion, all his
   arts and subtleties defeated by infinite wisdom, and his enterprise
   overthrown in a way of right and equity. The remark that the Holy Ghost
   puts on the serpent, which was his instrument in drawing man to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   apostasy from God -- namely, that he was "more subtle than any beast of
   the field" -- is only to intimate in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> Satan designed his attempt,
   and from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> he hoped for his success. It was not an act of power or
   rage; but of craft, counsel, subtlety, and deceit. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he gloried
   and prided himself; therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the way to disappoint him with shame,
   must be a contrivance of infinite wisdom, turning all his artifices
   into mere folly.
				</p><p>
   This work of God, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, is expressed in the Scripture
   two ways:  First, it is called the spoiling of him, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his power
   and the prey that he had taken. The "strong man armed" was to be bound,
   and his goods spoiled. The Lord Christ, by his death, "destroyed him
   that had the power of death, that is, the devil." He "led captivity
   captive," spoiling principalities and powers, triumphing over them in
   his cross. So Abraham, when he smote the kings, not only delivered Lot,
   who was their captive, but also took all their spoils. Again, it is
   expressed by the destruction of his works: "For this cause was the Son
   of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." The
   spoils which he had in his own power were taken from him, and the works
   which he had erected in the minds of men were demolished. The web which
   he had woven to clothe himself withal, as the god of this world, was
   unravelled to the last thread. And although all this seems to represent
   a work of power, yet was it indeed an effect of wisdom and
   righteousness principally.
				</p><p>
   For the power which Satan had over mankind was in itself unjust. For,
   (1.) He obtained it by fraud and deceit: "The serpent beguiled" Eve.
   (2.) He possessed it with injustice, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, being an
   invader of his right and possession. (3.) He used and exercised it with
   malice, tyranny, and rage; -- so as that it was every way unjust, both
   in its foundation and execution. With respect to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he was justly
   destroyed by omnipotent power, which puts forth itself in his eternal
   punishment. But, on the other side, mankind did suffer justly under his
   power -- being given up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it in the righteous judgement of God. For
   one may suffer justly what another does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> unjustly inflict; as when one
   causelessly strikes an innocent man, if he strikes him again, he who
   did the first injury suffers<note n="suffereth">Auto-modernized</note> justly, but the other does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> unjustly in
   revenging himself. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as man was given up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in a way of
   punishment, he was a lawful captive, and was not to be delivered but in
   a way of justice. And this was done in a way that Satan never thought
   of. For, by the obedience and sufferings of the Son of God incarnate,
   there was full satisfaction made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the justice of God for the sins
   of man, a reparation of his glory, and an exaltation of the honour of
   his holiness, with all the other properties of his nature, as also of
   his law, outbalancing all the diminution of it by the first apostasy of
   mankind; as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been declared. Immediately upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> all the charms of
   Satan were dissolved, all his chains loosed, his darkness that he had
   brought on the creation dispelled, his whole plot and design defeated;
   -- whereon he saw himself, and was exposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the holy angels of
   heaven, in all the counsels, craft, and power he had boasted of, to be
   nothing but a congeries -- a mass of darkness, malice, folly,
   impotency, and rage.
				</p><p>
   Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> did Satan make an entrance into one of the principal parts of
   his eternal torments, in that furious self-maceration which he is given
   up to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> on the consideration of his defeat and disappointment. Absolute
   power he always feared, and what it would produce; for he believes
   that, and trembles. But against any other war he thought he had secured
   himself. It lies plain to every understanding, what shame, confusion,
   and self-revenge, the proud apostate was cast into, upon his holy,
   righteous disappointment of his design; whereas he had always promised
   himself to carry his cause, or at least to put God to act in the
   destruction of his dominion, by mere omnipotent power, without regard
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any other properties of his nature. To find that which he
   contrived for the destruction of the glory of God -- the disappointment
   of his ends in the creation of all things -- and the eternal ruin of
   mankind, to issue in a more glorious exaltation of the holy properties
   of the divine nature, and an unspeakable augmentation of blessedness
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mankind itself, is the highest aggravation of his eternal
   torments. This was a work every way becoming the infinite wisdom of
   God.
				</p><p>
   9. Whereas there are three distinct persons in the holy Trinity, it
   became the wisdom of God that the Son, the second person, should
   undertake this work, and be incarnate. I shall but sparingly touch on
   this glorious mystery; for as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the reason of it, it is absolutely
   resolved into the infinite wisdom and sovereign counsel of the divine
   will. And all such things are the objects of a holy admiration -- not
   curiously to be inquired into. To intrude ourselves into the things
   which we have not seen -- that is, which are not revealed -- in those
   concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of them which are not revealed, is not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the advantage
   of faith in our edification. But as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what is declared of them --
   either immediately and directly, or by their relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> other known
   truths -- we may meditate on them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the improvement of faith and
   love towards God. And some things are thus evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in this
   mystery.
				</p><p>
   (1.) We had by sin lost the image of God, and thereby all gracious
   acceptance with him, -- all interest in his love and favour. In our
   recovery, as we have declared, this image is again to be restored to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, or we are to be renewed into the likeness of God. And there was a
   condecency to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom, that this work should, in a peculiar
   manner, be effected by him who is the essential image of God -- that
   is, the Father. This, as we have formerly showed, was the person of the
   Son. Receiving his personal subsistence, and with that<note n="therewithal">Auto-modernized</note> the divine
   nature, with all its essential properties, from the Father by eternal
   generation, he was upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> the express image of his person, and the
   brightness of his glory. Whatever is in the person of the Father is in
   the person of the Son, and being all received from the Father, he is
   his essential image. And one end of his incarnation was, that he might
   be the representative image of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. Whereas, therefore, in the
   work of our recovery, the image of God should be restored in us, there
   was a condecency that it should be done by him who was the essential
   image of God; for it consists in the communication of the effects and
   likeness of the same image to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us which was essentially in himself.
				</p><p>
   (2.) We were by nature the sons of God. We stood in relation of sons
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by virtue of our creation -- the communication of his image
   and likeness -- with the preparation of an inheritance for us. On the
   same accounts the angels are frequently called the sons of God. This
   title, this relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, we utterly lost by sin, becoming aliens
   from him, and enemies to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. Without a recovery into this estate we
   cannot be restored, nor brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the enjoyment of God. And this
   cannot be done but by adoption. Now, it seems convenient to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine
   wisdom that he should recover our sonship by adoption, who was himself
   the essential and eternal Son of God.
				</p><p>
   (3.) The sum of what we can comprehend in this great mystery arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note>
   from the consideration of the order of the holy persons of the blessed
   Trinity in their operations; for their order in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> follow that of
   their subsistence. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this great work there are peculiarly required,
   authority, love, and power -- all directed by infinite wisdom. These
   originally reside in the person of the Father, and the acting of them
   in this matter is constantly ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. He sent the Son, as he
   gives the Spirit, by an act of sovereign authority. And he sent the Son
   from his eternal love; -- he loved the world, and sent his Son to die.
   This is constantly assigned to be the effect of the love and grace of
   the Father. And he wrought in Christ, and he works in us, with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of this mystery, with the "exceeding greatness of his
   power," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:19</reference> The Son, who is the second person in the order of
   subsistence, in the order of operation puts the whole authority, love,
   and power of the Father in execution. This order of subsistence and
   operation upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> is expressly declared by the apostle, <reference osisRef="1Cor.8.6">1 Corinthians 8:6</reference>,
   "To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we
   in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
   him." The Father is the original fountain and spring, ex hou, from whom
   -- [from] whose original authority, love, goodness, and power -- are
   all these things. That expression, "from him," peculiarly denotes the
   eternal original of all things. But how are this authority, goodness,
   love, and power in the Father, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> all these things spring and
   arise, made effectual -- how are their effects wrought out and
   accomplished? "There is one Lord," even Jesus Christ, a distinct person
   from the Father, di? hou, "by whom are all things." He works in the
   order of his subsistence, to execute, work, and accomplish all that
   originally proceeds<note n="proceedeth">Auto-modernized</note> from the Father. By the Holy Spirit, who is the
   third person in order of subsistence, there is made a perfecting
   application of the whole to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all its proper ends.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, this work of our redemption and recovery being the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>
   effect of the authority, love, and power of the Father -- it was to be
   executed in and by the person of the Son; as the application of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us is made by the Holy Ghost. Hence it became not the person of the
   Father to assume our nature; -- it belonged not to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> in the order
   of subsistence and operation in the blessed Trinity. The authority,
   love, and power from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> the whole work proceeded, were his in a peculiar
   manner. But the execution of what infinite wisdom designed in them and
   by them belonged to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another. Nor did this belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the person of
   the Holy Spirit, who, in order of divine operation following that of
   his subsistence, was to perfect the whole work, in making application
   of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church when it was wrought. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> it was every way
   suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> divine wisdom -- to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the order of the Holy Persons in
   their subsistence and operation -- that this work should be undertaken
   and accomplished in the person of the Son. What is farther must be
   referred to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> another world.
				</p><p>
   These are some few of those things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the infinite wisdom of God
   in this holy contrivance gives<note n="giveth">Auto-modernized</note> forth some rays of itself into
   enlightened minds and truly humbled souls. But how little a portion of
   it is heard by us! How weak, how low are our conceptions about it! We
   cannot in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> find out the Almighty to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfection. No small part of
   the glory of heaven will consist in that comprehension which we shall
   have of the mystery of the wisdom, love, and grace of God in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, we are with all diligence to inquire into it whilst we are
   here in the way. It is the very centre of all glorious evangelical
   truths. Not one of them can be understood, believed, or improved as
   they ought, without a due comprehension of their relation to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; as
   we have showed before.
				</p><p>
   This is that which the prophets of old inquired into and after with all
   diligence, even the mystery of God manifest in the flesh, with the
   glory that ensued upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.11">1 Peter 1:11</reference> Yet had they not that light to
   discern it by which we have. The "least in the kingdom of God," as to
   the knowledge of this mystery, may be above the greatest of them. And
   ought we not to fear lest our sloth under the beams of the sun should
   be condemned by their diligence in the twilight?
				</p><p>
   This the angels bow down to look into, although their concerns in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>
   are not equal to ours. But angels are angels, and prophets were
   prophets; we are a generation of poor, sinful men, who are little
   concerned in the glory of God or our own duty.
				</p><p>
   Is it not much to be lamented that many Christians content themselves
   with a very superficiary knowledge of these things? How are the
   studies, the abilities, the time, and diligence of many excellent
   persons engaged in, and laid out about, the works of nature, and the
   effects of divine wisdom and power in them, by whom any endeavour to
   inquire into this glorious mystery is neglected, if not despised! Alas!
   The light of divine wisdom in the greatest works of nature holds not
   the proportion of the meanest star to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the sun in its full strength,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that glory of it which shines in this mystery of God manifest in
   the flesh, and the work accomplished thereby! A little time shall put
   an end to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole subject of their inquiries, with all the
   concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of God and man in them for evermore. This alone is that
   which fills up eternity, and which, although it be now with some a
   nothing, yet will shortly be all.
				</p><p>
   Is it not much more to be lamented, that many who are called Christians
   do even despise these mysteries? Some oppose them directly with
   pernicious heresies about the person of Christ, denying his divine
   nature, or the personal union of his two natures through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the whole
   mystery of infinite wisdom is evacuated and rejected; and some there
   are who, though they do not deny the truth of this mystery, yet they
   both despise and reproach such as with any diligence endeavour to
   inquire into it. I shall add the words used on a like occasion, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them who sincerely believe the mysteries of the Gospel: "But ye,
   beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the
   Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy
   of our Lord Jesus Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternal life." And the due contemplation
   of this mystery will certainly be attended with many spiritual
   advantages.
				</p><p>
   [1.] It will bring in steadfastness in believing, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>
   concerns of our own souls; so as to give to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God the glory that is his
   due upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. This is the work, these are the ends, of faith, <reference osisRef="Rom.5.1 Rom.5.2 Rom.5.3 Rom.5.4 Rom.5.5">Romans 5:1-5</reference> We see how many Christians who are sincere believers, yet
   fluctuate in their minds with great uncertainties as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their own
   state and condition. The principal reason of it is, because they are
   "unskilful in the word of righteousness," and so are babes, in a weak
   condition, as the apostle speaks, <reference osisRef="Heb.5.13">Hebrews 5:13</reference> This is the way of
   spiritual peace. When the soul of a believer is able to take a view of
   the glory of the wisdom of God, exalting all the other holy properties
   of his nature, in this great mystery to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our salvation, it will
   obviate all fears, remove all objections, and be a means of bringing in
   assured peace into the mind; which without a due comprehension of it
   will never be attained.
				</p><p>
   [2.] The acting of faith upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> is that which is accompanied with its
   great power to change and transform the soul into the image and
   likeness of Christ. So is it expressed by the apostle, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference>,
   "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
   are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the
   Spirit of the Lord" -- we all beholding -- katoptrizomenoi, not taking
   a transient glance of these things, but diligently inspecting them, as
   those do who, through a glass, design a steady view of things at a
   distance. [2] That which we are thus to behold by the continued actings
   of faith in holy contemplation, is the "glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ," as it is expressed, <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference>; which is nothing but
   that mystery of godliness in whose explanation we have been engaged.
   And what is the effect of the steady contemplation of this mystery by
   faith? Metamorphoumetha -- "we are changed" -- made quite other
   creatures than we were -- cast into the form, figure, and image of
   Jesus Christ -- the great design of all believers in this world. Would
   we, then, be like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ? Would we bear the image of the heavenly,
   as we have borne the image of the earthy? Is nothing so detestable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us as the deformed image of the old man, in the lusts of the mind and
   of the flesh? Is nothing so amiable and desirable as the image of
   Christ, and the representation of God in him? This is the way, this is
   the means of attaining the end which we aim at.
				</p><p>
   [3.] Abounding in this duty is the most effectual means of freeing us,
   in particular, from the shame and bane of profession in
   earthly-mindedness. There is nothing so unbecoming a Christian as to
   have his mind always exercised about, always filled with thoughts of,
   earthly things and according as men's thoughts are exercised about
   them, their affections are increased and inflamed towards them. These
   things mutually promote one another, and there is a kind of circulation
   in them. Multiplied thoughts inflame affections, and inflamed
   affections increase the number of thoughts concerning them. Nothing is
   more repugnant to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the whole life of faith, nothing more obstructive
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the exercise of all grace, than a prevalence of this frame of
   mind. And at this season, in a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner, it is visibly preying
   on the vitals of religion. To abound in the contemplation of this
   mystery, and in the exercise of faith about it, as it is diametrically
   opposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this frame, so it will gradually cast it out of the soul.
   And without this we shall labour in the fire for deliverance from this
   pernicious evil.
				</p><p>
   [4.] And hereby are we prepared for the enjoyment of glory above. No
   small part of that glory consists in the eternal contemplation and
   adoration of the wisdom, goodness, love, and power of God in this
   mystery, and the effects of it; as shall afterward be declared.
				</p><p>
   And how can we better or otherwise be prepared for it, but by the
   implanting a sense of it on our minds by sedulous contemplation whilst
   we are in this world? God will not take us into heaven, into the vision
   and possession of heavenly glory, with our heads and hearts reeking
   with the thoughts and affections of earthly things. He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed
   means to make us "meet for the inheritance of the saints in light,"
   before he will bring us into the enjoyment of it. And this is the
   principal way through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it; for hereby it is that we are
   "changed" into the image of Christ, "from glory to glory," and make the
   nearest approaches to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the eternal fulness of it.
</p>
<p>   [2] Katoptrizo does not admit of the signification here ascribed to it
   by Dr Owen. It denotes looking into a mirror, not through a telescope:
   "Beholding the glory of the Lord as reflected and radiant in the
   Gospel." -- See Dr Robinson'sLexicon. Another view is taken of the
   passage, by which a tacit antithesis is instituted between katoptron
   and eikon: "Dominus nos katoptrizei, splendorem faciei su� in corda
   nostra, tanquam in specula immittens: nos illum splendorem suscipimus
   et referimus. Elegans antitheton ad entetupomene, insculpta. Nam qu�
   insculpuntur fiunt paullatim: qu� in speculo repr�sentantur, fiunt
   celerrime." BengeliiGnomon in locum. Owen himself gives a correct
   explanation of the passage in his work on the Mortification of Sin,
   chap. xii. -- Ed.

<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 18 The Nature of the Person of Christ and the Hypostatical Union of his Natures Declared">
<title>Chapter 18 The Nature of the Person of Christ, and the Hypostatical Union of his Natures Declared.</title>
<p>   The nature or constitution of the person of Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been commonly
   spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and treated of in the writings both of the ancient and
   modern divines. It is not my purpose, in this discourse, to handle
   anything that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been so fully already declared by others. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>,
   to speak something of it in this place is necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the present
   work; and I shall do it in answer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a double end or design: 
				</p><p>
   First, To help those that believe, in the regulation of their thoughts
   about this divine person, so far as the Scripture goes<note n="goeth">Auto-modernized</note> before us. It
   is of great importance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our souls that we have right conceptions
   concerning him; not only in general, and in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   pernicious heresies of them by whom his divine person or either of his
   natures is denied, but also in those special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> instances in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it is
   the most ineffable effect of divine wisdom and grace. For although the
   knowledge of him mentioned in the Gospel be not confined merely to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his person in the constitution of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, but extends itself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   whole work of his mediation, with the design of God's love and grace
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, with our own duty upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>; yet is this knowledge of his person
   the foundation of all the rest, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> if we mistake or fail, our
   whole building in the other parts of the knowledge of him will fall
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the ground. And although the saving knowledge of him is not to be
   obtained without special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> divine revelation, <reference osisRef="Matt.16.17">Matthew 16:17</reference> -- or saving
   illumination, <reference osisRef="1John.5.20">1 John 5:20</reference> -- nor can we know him perfectly until we
   come where he is to behold his glory, <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference>; yet are
   instructions from the Scripture of use to lead us into those farther
   degrees of the knowledge of him which are attainable in this life.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, To manifest in particular how ineffably distinct the relation
   between the Son of God and the man Christ Jesus is, from all that
   relation and union which may be between God and believers, or between
   God and any other creature. The want of a true understanding of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> is
   the fundamental error of many in our days. We shall manifest thereupon
   how "it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell," so
   that in all things "he might have the pre-eminence," <reference osisRef="Col.1.18 Col.1.19">Colossians 1:18-19</reference>
   And I shall in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> wholly avoid the curious inquiries, bold
   conjectures, and unwarrantable determinations of the schoolmen and some
   others. For many of them, designing to explicate this mystery, by
   exceeding the bounds of Scripture light and sacred sobriety, have
   obscured it. Endeavouring to render all things plain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> reason, they
   have expressed many things unsound as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> faith, and fallen into
   manifold contradictions among themselves. Hence Aquinas affirms, that
   three of the ways of declaring the hypostatical union which are
   proposed by the Master of the Sentences, [3] are so far from probable
   opinions, as that they are downright heresies. I shall therefore
   confine myself, in the explication of this mystery, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   propositions of divine revelation, with the just and necessary
   expositions of them.
				</p><p>
   What the Scripture represents of the wisdom of God in this great work
   may be reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these four heads:  I. The assumption of our nature
   into personal subsistence with the Son of God. II. The union of the two
   natures in that single person which is consequential upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. III. The
   mutual communication of those distinct natures, the divine and human,
   by virtue of that union. IV. The enunciations or predications
   concerning the person of Christ, which follow on that union and
   communion.
				</p><p>
   I. The first thing in the divine constitution of the person of Christ
   as God and man, is assumption. That ineffable divine act I intend
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the person of the Son of God assumed our nature, or took it
   into a personal subsistence with himself. This the Scripture expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note>
   sometimes actively, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine nature acting in the
   person of the Son, the nature assuming; sometimes passively, with
   respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human nature, the nature assumed. The first it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.2.14 Heb.2.16">Hebrews 2:14, 16</reference>, "Forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and
   blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same. For verily he
   took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of
   Abraham;" <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7">Philippians 2:6-7</reference>, "Being in the form of God, he took upon him
   the form of a servant;" and in sundry other places. The assumption, the
   taking of our human nature to be his own, by an ineffable act of his
   power and grace, is clearly expressed. And to take it to be his own,
   his own nature, can be no otherwise but by giving it a subsistence in
   his own person; otherwise his own nature it is not, nor can be. Hence
   God is said to "purchase his church with his own blood," <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference>
   That relation and denomination of "his own," is from the single person
   of him whose it is. The latter is declared, <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>, "The Word was
   made flesh;" <reference osisRef="Rom.8.3">Romans 8:3</reference>, God sent "his own Son in the likeness of
   sinful flesh;" <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference>, "Made of a woman, made under the law;" <reference osisRef="Rom.1.3">Romans 1:3</reference>, "Made of the seed of David according to the flesh." The eternal
   Word, the Son of God, was not made flesh, not made of a woman, nor of
   the seed of David, by the conversion of his substance or nature into
   flesh; which implies a contradiction, -- and, besides, is absolutely
   destructive of the divine nature. He could no otherwise, therefore, be
   made flesh, or made of a woman, but in that our nature was made his, by
   his assuming of it to be his own. The same person -- who before was not
   flesh, was not man -- was made flesh as man, in that he took our human
   nature to be his own.
				</p><p>
   This ineffable act is the foundation of the divine relation between the
   Son of God and the man Christ Jesus. We can only adore the mysterious
   nature of it, -- "great is this mystery of godliness." Yet may we
   observe sundry things to direct us in that duty.
				</p><p>
   1. As to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> original efficiency, it was the act of the divine nature,
   and so, consequently, of the Father, Son, and Spirit. For so are all
   outward acts of God -- the divine nature being the immediate principle
   of all such operations. The wisdom, power, grace, and goodness exerted
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, are essential properties of the divine nature. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the
   acting of them originally belongs equally to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> each person, equally
   participant of that nature. (1.) As to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> authoritative designation, it
   was the act of the Father. Hence is he said to send "his Son in the
   likeness of sinful flesh," <reference osisRef="Rom.8.3">Romans 8:3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</reference> (2.) As to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   formation of the human nature, it was the peculiar act of the Spirit,
   <reference osisRef="Luke.1.35">Luke 1:35</reference> (3.) As to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the term of the assumption, or the taking of
   our nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, it was the peculiar act of the person of the
   Son. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, as Damascen observes, the other persons had no
   concurrence, but only kata boulesin kai eudokian -- "by counsel and
   approbation."
				</p><p>
   2. This assumption was the only immediate act of the divine nature on
   the human in the person of the Son. All those that follow, in
   subsistence, sustentation, with all others that are communicative, do
   ensue upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   3. This assumption and the hypostatical union are distinct and
   different in the formal reason of them. (1.) Assumption is the
   immediate act of the divine nature in the person of the Son on the
   human; union is mediate, by virtue of that assumption. (2.) Assumption
   is to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> personality; it is that act through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the Son of God and our
   nature became one person. Union is an act or relation of the natures
   subsisting in that one person. (3.) Assumption respects the acting of
   the divine and the passion of the human nature; the one assumes<note n="assumeth">Auto-modernized</note>, the
   other is assumed. Union respects the mutual relation of the natures
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> each other. Hence the divine nature may be said to be united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the human, as well as the human to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine; but the divine nature
   cannot be said to be assumed as the human is. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> assumption
   denotes the acting of the one nature and the passion of the other;
   union, the mutual relation that is between them both.
				</p><p>
   These things may be safely affirmed, and ought to be firmly believed,
   as the sense of the Holy Ghost in those expressions: "He took on him
   the seed of Abraham" -- "He took on him the form of a servant;" and the
   like. And who can conceive the condescension of divine goodness, or the
   acting of divine wisdom and power in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>?
				</p><p>
   II. That which follows<note n="followeth">Auto-modernized</note> upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note>, is the union of the two natures in the
   same person, or the hypostatical union. This is included and asserted
   in a multitude of divine testimonies. <reference osisRef="Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</reference>, "Behold, a virgin
   shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel," as
   <reference osisRef="Matt.1.23">Matthew 1:23</reference> He who was conceived and born of the virgin was Emmanuel,
   or God with us; that is, God manifest in the flesh, by the union of his
   two natures in the same person. <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>, "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a child is born,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a son is given: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
   Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, the Prince of
   Peace." That the same person should be "the mighty God" and a "child
   born," is neither conceivable nor possible, nor can be true, but by the
   union of the divine and human natures in the same person. So he said of
   himself, "Before Abraham was, I am," <reference osisRef="John.8.58">John 8:58</reference> That he, the same
   person who then spake to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Jews, and as a man was little more than
   thirty years of age, should also be before Abraham, undeniably confirms
   the union of another nature, in the same person with that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he
   spoke those words, and without which they could not be true. He had not
   only another nature which did exist before Abraham, but the same
   individual person who then spoke in the human nature did then exist.
   See to the same purpose, <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.9.5">Romans 9:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.3.16">1 John 3:16</reference>
				</p><p>
   This union the ancient church affirmed to be made atreptos, "without
   any change" in the person of the Son of God, which the divine nature is
   not subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; -- adiairetos, with a distinction of natures, but
   "without any division" of them by separate subsistences; -- asunchutos,
   "without mixture" or confusion; -- achoristos, "without separation" or
   distance; and ousiodos, "substantially," because it was of two
   substances or essences in the same person, in opposition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all
   accidental union, as the "fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily."
   [4]
				</p><p>
   These expressions were found out and used by the ancient church to
   prevent the fraud of those who corrupted the doctrine of the person of
   Christ, and (as all of that sort ever did, and yet continue so to do)
   obscured their pernicious sentiments under ambiguous expressions. And
   they also made use of sundry terms which they judged significant of
   this great mystery, or the incarnation of the Son of God. Such are
   ensarkosis, "incarnation;" ensomatosis, "embodying," enanthropesis,
   "inhumanation;" he despotike epidemia, kai parousia, he oikonomia, to
   the same purpose; he dia sarkos homilia, "his conversation in or by the
   flesh;" he dia anthropotetos phanerosis, "his manifestation by
   humanity;" he eleusis, "the advent;" he kenosis, "the exinanition", or
   humiliation; he tou Christou epiphaneia, "the appearance" or
   manifestation "of Christ;" he sunkatabasis, "the condescension." Most
   of these expressions are taken from the Scripture, and are used in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>
   with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this mystery, or some concerns<note n="concernments">Auto-modernized</note> of it. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>,
   as our faith is not confined to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any one of these words or terms, so
   as that we should be obliged to believe not only the things intended,
   but also the manner of its expression in them; so, in as far as they
   explain the thing intended according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the mind of the Holy Ghost in
   the Scripture, and obviate the senses of men of corrupt minds, they are
   to be embraced and defended as useful helps in teaching the truth.
				</p><p>
   That through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it is most usually declared in the writings of the
   ancients, is charis henoseos, "gratia unionis", the "grace of union;"
   -- which form of words some manifesting themselves strangers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, do
   declare how little conversant they are in their writings. Now, it is
   not any habitual inherent grace residing subjectively in the person or
   human nature of Christ that is intended, but things of another nature.
				</p><p>
   1. The cause of this union is expressed in it. This is the free grace
   and favour of God towards the man Christ Jesus -- predestinating,
   designing, and taking him into actual union with the person of the Son,
   without respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, or foresight of, any precedent dignity or merit
   in him, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.20">1 Peter 1:20</reference>
				</p><p>
   Hence is that of Austin, "E� grati� fit ab initio fidei su� homo
   quicunque Christianus, qu� grati� homo ille ab initio factus est
   Christus," De Pr�dest. Sanct., cap. xv. For whereas all the inherent
   grace of the human nature of Christ, and all the holy obedience which
   proceeded from it, was consequent in order of nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this union,
   and an effect of it, they could in no sense be the meritorious or
   procuring causes of it; -- it was of grace.
				</p><p>
   2. It is used also by many and designed to express the peculiar dignity
   of the human nature of Christ. This is that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> no creature is
   participant, nor ever shall be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity. This is the fundamental
   privilege of the human nature of Christ, which all others, even to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his eternal glory, proceed from, and are resolved into.
				</p><p>
   3. The glorious meetness and ability of the person of Christ, for and
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the acts and duties of his mediatory office. For they are all
   resolved into the union of his natures in the same person, without
   which not one of them could be performed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the benefit of the
   church. And this is that "grace of our Lord Jesus Christ," which
   renders him so glorious and amiable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> believers. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them "that
   believe he is precious."
				</p><p>
   The common prevalent expression of it at present in the church is the
   hypostatical union; that is, the union of the divine and human nature
   in the person of the Son of God, the human nature having no personality
   nor subsistence of its own.
				</p><p>
   With respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this union the name of Christ is called "Wonderful,"
   as that which has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the pre-eminence in all the effects of divine
   wisdom. And it is a singular effect of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. There is no other union in
   things divine or human, in things spiritual or natural, whether
   substantial or accidental, that is of the same kind with it; -- it
   differs specifically from them all.
				</p><p>
   (1.) The most glorious union is that of the Divine Persons in the same
   being or nature; the Father in the Son, the Son in the Father, the Holy
   Spirit in them both, and both in him. But this is a union of distinct
   persons in the unity of the same single nature. And this, I confess, is
   more glorious than that of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> we treat; for it is in God absolutely,
   it is eternal, of his nature and being. But this union we speak of is
   not God; -- it is a creature, -- an effect of divine wisdom and power.
   And it is different from it in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, inasmuch as that is of many
   distinct persons in the same nature; -- this is of distinct natures in
   the same person. That union is natural, substantial, essential, in the
   same nature; -- this, as it is not accidental, as we shall show, so it
   is not properly substantial, because it is not of the same nature, but
   of diverse in the same person, remaining distinct in their essence and
   substance, and is therefore peculiarly hypostatical or personal. Hence
   Austin feared not to say, that "Homo potius est in filio Dei, quam
   filius in Patre;" De Trin., lib. i. cap 10. But that is true only in
   this one respect, that the Son is not so in the Father as to become one
   person with him. In all other respects it must be granted that the
   in-being of the Son in the Father -- the union between them, which is
   natural, essential, and eternal -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> exceed this in glory, which was
   a temporary, external act of divine wisdom and grace.
				</p><p>
   (2.) The most eminent substantial union in things natural, is that of
   the soul and body constituting an individual person. There is, I
   confess, some kind of similitude between this union and that of the
   different natures in the person of Christ; but it is not of the same
   kind or nature. And the dissimilitudes that are between them are more,
   and of greater importance, than those things are in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> there seems to
   be an agreement between them. For, -- 1^st, The soul and body are so
   united as to constitute one entire nature. The soul is not human
   nature, nor is the body, but it is the consequent of their union. Soul
   and body are essential parts of human nature; but complete human nature
   they are not but by virtue of their union. But the union of the natures
   in the person of Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not constitute a new nature, that either
   was not or was not complete before. Each nature remains the same
   perfect, complete nature after this union. 2^dly, The union of the soul
   and body does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> constitute that nature which is made essentially complete
   thereby, -- a new individual person, with a subsistence of its own,
   which neither of them was nor had before that union. But although the
   person of Christ, as God and man, be constituted by this union, yet his
   person absolutely, and his individual subsistence, was perfect
   absolutely antecedent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that union. He did not become a new person,
   another person than he was before, by virtue of that union; only that
   person assumed human nature to itself to be its own, into personal
   subsistence. 3^dly, Soul and body are united by an external efficient
   cause, or the power of God, and not by the act of one of them upon
   another. But this union is effected by that act of the divine nature
   towards the human which we have before described. 4^thly, Neither soul
   nor body have any personal subsistence before their union; but the sole
   foundation of this union was in this, that the Son of God was a
   self-subsisting person from eternity.
				</p><p>
   (3.) There are other unions in things natural, which are by mixture of
   composition. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> something is produced composed of various parts,
   which is not what any of them are. And there is a conversion of things,
   when one thing is substantially changed into another, -- as the water
   in the miracle that Christ wrought was turned into wine; but this union
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no resemblance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any of them. There is not a krasis, "a
   mixture," a contemperation of the divine and human natures into one
   third nature, or the conversion of one into another. Such notions of
   these things some fancied of old. Eutyches [5] supposed such a
   composition and mixture of the two natures in the person of Christ, as
   that the human nature at least should lose all its essential
   properties, and have neither understanding nor will of its own. And
   some of the Arians fancied a substantial change of that created divine
   nature which they acknowledged, into the human. But these imaginations,
   instead of professing Christ to be God and man, would leave him indeed
   neither God nor man; and have been sufficiently confuted. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the
   union we treat of has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> no similitude to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any such natural union as is
   the effect of composition or mutation.
				</p><p>
   (4.) There is an artificial union with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> some have illustrated this
   mystery; as that of fire and iron in the same sword. The sword is one;
   the nature of fire and that of iron different; -- and the acts of them
   distinct; the iron cuts, the fire burns; -- and the effects distinct;
   cutting and burning; yet is the agent or instrument but one sword.
   Something of this nature may be allowed to be spoken in way of
   allusion; but it is a weak and imperfect representation of this
   mystery, on many accounts. For the heat in iron is rather an accident
   than a substance, is separable from it, and in sundry other things
   diverts the mind from due apprehensions of this mystery.
				</p><p>
   (5.) There is a spiritual union, -- namely, of Christ and believers; or
   of God in Christ and believers, which is excellent and mysterious, --
   such as all other unions in nature are made use of in the Scripture to
   illustrate and represent. This some among us do judge to be of the same
   kind with that of the Son of God and the man Christ Jesus. Only they
   say they differ in degrees. The eternal Word was so united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the man
   Christ Jesus, as that thereby he was exalted inconceivably above all
   other men, though ever so holy, and had greater communications from God
   than any of them. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> he was on many accounts the Son of God in a
   peculiar manner; and, by a communication of names, is called God also.
   This being the opinion of Nestorius, [6] revived again in the days
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> we live, I shall declare in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he placed the union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note> or
   union of the two natures of Christ, -- through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he constituted two
   distinct persons of the Son of God and the Son of man, as these now do,
   -- and briefly detect the vanity of it. For the whole of it consisted
   in the concession of sundry things that were true in particular, making
   use of the pretence of them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the denial of that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> alone the
   true union of the person of Christ did consist.
				</p><p>
   Nestorius allowed the presence of the Son of God with the man Christ
   Jesus to consist in five things.
				</p><p>
   [1.] He said he was so present with him kata parastasin, or by
   inhabitation, as a man dwells in a house or a ship to rule it. He dwelt
   in him as his temple. So he dwells in all that believe, but in him in a
   more special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> manner. And this is true with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that fulness
   of the Spirit through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God was with him and in him; as he is with and in
   all believers, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the measures in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are made
   partakers of him. But this answers not that divine testimony, that in
   him dwelt "all the fulness of the Godhead bodily," <reference osisRef="Col.2.9">Colossians 2:9</reference> The
   fulness of the Godhead is the entire divine nature. This nature is
   considered in the person of the Son, or eternal Word; for it was the
   Word that was made flesh. And this could no otherwise dwell in him
   bodily, really, substantially, but in the assumption of that nature to
   be his own. And no sense can be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this assertion to preserve
   it from blasphemy, -- that the fulness of the Godhead dwells<note n="dwelleth">Auto-modernized</note> in any
   of the saints bodily.
				</p><p>
   [2.] He allowed a special<note n="an special">Auto-modernized</note><note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> presence, kata schesin, as some call it;
   that is, by such a union of affections as is between intimate friends.
   The soul of God rested always in that man [Christ]; -- in him was he
   well pleased: and he was wholly given up in his affections to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
   This also is true; but there is that which is no less true, that
   renders it useless to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the pretensions of Nestorius. For he allowed
   the divine person of the Son of God. But whatever is spoken of this
   nature concerning the love of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the man Christ Jesus, and of his
   love to God, it is the person of the Father that is intended in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>;
   nor can any one instance be given where it is capable of another
   interpretation. For it is still spoken of with reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the work
   that he was sent of the Father to accomplish, and his own delight
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   [3.] He allowed it to be kat? axian, by way of dignity and honour. For
   this union<note n="conjunction">Auto-modernized</note> is such, as that whatever honour is given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son
   of God is also to be given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that Son of man. But in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, to
   recompense his sacrilege in taking away the hypostatical union from the
   church, he would introduce idolatry into it. For the honour that is due
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Son of God is divine, religious, or the owning of all
   essential divine properties in him, with a due subjection of soul to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. But to give this honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the man Christ Jesus, without
   a supposition of the subsistence of his human nature in the person of
   the Son of God, and solely on that account, is highly idolatrous.
				</p><p>
   [4.] He asserted it to be kata tautoboulian, or on the account of the
   consent and agreement that was between the will of God and the will of
   the man Christ Jesus. But no other union will thence ensue, but what is
   between God and the angels in heaven; in whom there is a perfect
   compliance with the will of God in all things. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, if this be
   the foundation of this union, he might be said to take on him the
   nature of angels as well as the seed of Abraham; which is expressly
   denied by the apostle, <reference osisRef="Heb.2.16 Heb.2.17">Hebrews 2:16-17</reference>
				</p><p>
   [5.] Kath? homonuian, by an equivocal denomination, the name of the one
   person, namely, of the Son of God, being accommodated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the other,
   namely, the Son of man. So they were called gods to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> whom the word of
   God came. But this no way answers any one divine testimony in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   name of God is assigned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Christ, -- as those in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God
   is said "to lay down his life for us," and to "purchase his church with
   his own blood," to come and be "manifest in the flesh," -- in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> no
   homonymy or equivocation can take place. By all these ways he
   constituted a separable accidental union, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> nothing in kind, but
   in degree only, was peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the man Christ Jesus.
				</p><p>
   But all these things, so far as they are true, belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the third
   thing to be considered in his person, -- namely, the communion or
   mutual communication of the distinct natures in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. But his personal
   union consists not in any of them, nor in all of them together; nor do
   they answer any of the multiplied testimonies given by the Holy Ghost
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this glorious mystery. Some few of them may be mentioned.
				</p><p>
   "The Word was made flesh," <reference osisRef="John.1.14">John 1:14</reference> There can be but two senses of
   these words (1^st,) That the Word ceased to be what it was, and was
   substantially turned into flesh (2^dly,) That continuing to be what it
   was, it was made to be also what before it was not. The first sense is
   destructive of the Divine Being and all its essential properties. The
   other can be verified only in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, that the Word took that flesh --
   that is, our human nature -- to be his own, his own nature in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he
   was made flesh; which is that we plead for. For this assertion, that
   the person of the Son took our nature to be his own, is the same with
   that of the assumption of the human nature into personal subsistence
   with himself. And the ways of the presence of the Son of God with the
   man Christ Jesus, before mentioned, do express nothing in answer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   this divine testimony, that "The Word was made flesh."
				</p><p>
   "Being in the form of God, he took upon him the form of a servant, and
   became obedient," <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:6-8</reference> That by his being "in the form of
   God," his participation in and of the same divine nature with the
   Father is intended, these men grant; and that in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he was a person
   distinct from him Nestorius of old acknowledged, though it be by ours
   denied. But they can fancy no distinction that shall bear the
   denomination and relation of Father and Son; but all is inevitably
   included in it which we plead for under that name. This person "took on
   him the form of a servant," -- that is, the nature of man in the
   condition of a servant. For it is the same with his being made of a
   woman, made under the law; or taking on him the seed of Abraham. And
   this person became obedient. It was in the human nature, in the form of
   a servant, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was obedient. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> that human nature was the
   nature of that person, -- a nature which he took on him and made his
   own, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he would be obedient. And that the human nature is the
   nature of the person of him who was in the form of God, is that
   hypostatical union which we believe and plead for.
				</p><p>
   "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a child is born, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a son is given; and his name shall be
   called The mighty God," <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference> The child and the mighty God are
   the same person, or he that is "born a child" cannot be rightly called
   "The mighty God." And the truth of many other expressions in the
   Scripture has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> its sole foundation in this hypostatical union. So the
   Son of God took on him "the seed of Abraham," was "made of a woman,"
   did "partake of flesh and blood," was "manifest in the flesh." That he
   who was born of the blessed Virgin was "before Abraham," -- that he was
   made of the "seed of David according to the flesh," -- through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God
   "purchased the church with his own blood," -- are all spoken of one and
   the same person, and are not true but on the account of the union of
   the two natures in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. And all those who plead for the accidental
   metaphorical union, consisting in the instances before mentioned, do
   know well enough that the true Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ is
   opposed by them.
				</p><p>
   III. Concurrent with, and in part consequent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, this union, is the
   communion of the distinct natures of Christ hypostatically united. And
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> we may consider, -- 1. What is peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Divine nature;
   2. What is common to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> both.
				</p><p>
   1. There is a threefold communication of the divine nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   human in this hypostatical union. (1.) Immediate in the person of the
   Son. This is subsistence. In itself it is anupostatos, -- that which
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> not a subsistence of its own, which should give it individuation
   and distinction from the same nature in any other person. But it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   its subsistence in the person of the Son, which thereby is its own. The
   divine nature, as in that person, is its suppositum . (2.) By the Holy
   Spirit he filled that nature with an all-fulness of habitual grace;
   which I have at large explained elsewhere. (3.) In all the acts of his
   office, by the divine nature, he communicated worth and dignity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   what was acted in and by the human nature.
				</p><p>
   For that which some have for a long season troubled the church withal,
   about such a real communication of the properties of the divine nature
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human, which should neither be a transfusion of them into it,
   so as to render it the subject of them, nor yet consist in a reciprocal
   denomination from their mutual in-being in the same subject, -- it is
   that which neither themselves do, nor can any other well understand.
				</p><p>
   2. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, concerning the communion of the natures in this personal
   union, three things are to be observed, which the Scripture, reason,
   and the ancient church, do all concur in.
				</p><p>
   (1.) Each nature does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> preserve its own natural, essential properties,
   entirely to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> and in itself; without mixture, without composition or
   confusion, without such a real communication of the one to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the other,
   as that the one should become the subject of the properties of the
   other. The Deity, in the abstract, is not made the humanity, nor on the
   contrary. The divine nature is not made temporary, finite, united,
   subject to passion or alteration by this union; nor is the human nature
   rendered immense, infinite, omnipotent. Unless this be granted, there
   will not be two natures in Christ, a divine and a human; nor indeed
   either of them, but somewhat else, composed of both.
				</p><p>
   (2.) Each nature operates in him according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its essential
   properties. The divine nature knows all things, upholds all things,
   rules all things, acts by its presence everywhere; the human nature was
   born, yielded obedience, died, and rose again. But it is the same
   person, the same Christ, that acts all these things, -- the one nature
   being his no less than the other. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) The perfect, complete work of Christ, in every act of his
   mediatory office, -- in all that he did as the King, Priest, and
   Prophet of the church, -- in all that he did and suffered, -- in all
   that he continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> to do for us, in or by virtue of whether nature
   soever it be done or wrought, -- is not to be considered as the act of
   this or that nature in him alone, but it is the act and work of the
   whole person, -- of him that is both God and man in one person. And
   this gives occasion, --
				</p><p>
   IV. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that variety of enunciations which is used in the Scripture
   concerning him; which I shall name only, and conclude.
				</p><p>
   1. Some things are spoken of the person of Christ, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the
   enunciation is verified with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one nature only; as -- "The
   Word was with God, and the Word was God," <reference osisRef="John.1.1">John 1:1</reference>; -- "Before Abraham
   was, I am," <reference osisRef="John.8.58">John 8:58</reference>, -- "Upholding all things by the word of his
   power," <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference> These things are all spoken of the person of Christ,
   but belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it on account of his divine nature. So is it said of
   him, "To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a child is born, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us a son is given," <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>; --
   "A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief," <reference osisRef="Isa.53.3">Isaiah 53:3</reference> They are
   spoken of the person of Christ, but are verified in human nature only,
   and the person on the account of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   2. Sometimes that is spoken of the person which belongs not distinctly
   and originally to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> either nature, but does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him on the
   account of their union in him, -- which are the most direct
   enunciations concerning the person of Christ. So is he said to be the
   Head, the King, Priest, and Prophet of the church; all which offices he
   bears, and performs the acts of them, not on the singular account of
   this or that nature, but of the hypostatical union of them both.
				</p><p>
   3. Sometimes his person being denominated from one nature, the
   properties and acts of the other are assigned to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. So they
   "crucified the Lord of glory." He is the Lord of glory on the account
   of his divine nature only; thence is his person denominated when he is
   said to be crucified, which was in the human nature only. So God
   purchased his church "with his own blood," <reference osisRef="Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</reference> The
   denomination of the person is from the divine nature only -- he is God;
   but the act ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, or what he did by his own blood, was of
   the human nature only. But the purchase that was made thereby was the
   work of the person as both God and man. So, on the other side, "The Son
   of man who is in heaven," <reference osisRef="John.3.13">John 3:13</reference> The denomination of the person
   is from the human nature only, -- "The Son of man." That ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   it was with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine nature only, -- "who is in heaven."
				</p><p>
   4. Sometimes the person being denominated from one nature, that is
   ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it which is common to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> both; or else being denominated
   from both, that which is proper to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one only is ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. See
   <reference osisRef="Rom.9.5">Romans 9:5</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.22.42">Matthew 22:42</reference>
				</p><p>
   These kinds of enunciations the ancients expressed by enallage,
   "alteration;" alloiosis, "permutation," koinotes, "communion;" tropos
   antidoseos, "the manner of mutual position;" koinonia idiomaton, "the
   communication of properties," and other the like expressions.
				</p><p>
   These things I have only mentioned, because they are commonly handled
   by others in their didactical and polemical discourses concerning the
   person of Christ, and could not well be here utterly omitted.

<p>   [3] Peter Lombard. Born near Novara, in Lombardy -- died in 1164,
   bishop of Paris -- called "Magister Sententiarum," from one of his
   works, which is a compilation of sentences from the Fathers, arranged
   so as to form a system of Divinity, and held in high repute during
   medi�val times. It appeared in 1172. -- Ed.

   [4] The first four of these terms were adopted by the Fourth
   OEcumenical Council, held at Chalcedon, a.d. 451. -- Ed.

   [5] Eutyches was a presbyter and abbot at Constantinople, and
   distinguished himself by his opposition to the Nestorians, a.d. 448,
   asserting that in Christ there is but one nature, and was condemned by
   the General Council at Chalcedon, a.d. 451. In the preface to this
   work, he is called "The Archimandrite." Mandrite is a Syriac work for
   "monk." Archimandrite corresponds with the term "abbot" in Europe. --

   [6] Born at Germanicia, in the north of Syria -- ordained a presbyter
   at Antioch -- appointed patriarch of Constantinople a.d. 428 --
   objected to the epithet Theotokos, as applied to the Virgin Mary,
   because "that God should be born of a human being is impossible" --
   charged in consequence with maintaining that Christ was a mere man --
   held in reality the distinct separation of the divine and human natures
   of Christ, insisting on a connection between them by sunapheia
   (junction), or enoikesis (indwelling), in opposition to henosis (union)
   -- deposed by the Third General Council of Ephesus, a.d. 431, and died
   probably before a.d. 450. -- Ed.

<title>Chapter 19 The Exaltation of Christ, with his Present State and Condition in Glory during the Continuance of his Mediatory Office.</title>
<p>   The apostle, describing the great mystery of godliness -- "God manifest
   in the flesh" -- by several degrees of ascent, he carries<note n="carrieth">Auto-modernized</note> it within
   the veil, and leaves it there in glory -- anelephthe en doxe, <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>; God was manifest in the flesh, and "received up into glory."
   This assumption of our Lord Jesus Christ into glory, or his glorious
   reception in heaven, with his state and condition in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, is a
   principal article of the faith of the church, -- the great foundation
   of its hope and consolation in this world. This, also, we must
   therefore consider in our meditations on the person of Christ, and the
   use of it in our religion.
				</p><p>
   That which I especially intend in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is his present state in heaven,
   in the discharge of his mediatory office, before the consummation of
   all things. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God, and the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note>
   of the church, at present depend. For, at the end of this dispensation,
   he shall give up the kingdom to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, even the Father, or cease from
   the administration of his mediatory office and power, as the apostle
   declares, <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.24 1Cor.15.25 1Cor.15.26 1Cor.15.27 1Cor.15.28">1 Corinthians 15:24-28</reference>, "Then comes<note n="cometh">Auto-modernized</note> the end, when he shall have
   delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have
   put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be
   destroyed is death. For he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> put all things under his feet. But when
   he says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note>, All this are put under him, it is manifest that he is
   excepted which did put all things under him. And when all things shall
   be subdued to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
				</p><p>
   All things fell by sin into an enmity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God and the
   salvation of the church. The removal of this enmity, and the
   destruction of all enemies, is the work that God committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his Son
   in his incarnation and mediation, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference> This he was variously to
   accomplish in the administration of all his offices. The enmity between
   God and us immediately, he removed by the blood of his cross, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note>
   he made peace, <reference osisRef="Eph.2.14 Eph.2.15 Eph.2.16">Ephesians 2:14-16</reference>; which peace he continues and preserves
   by his intercession, <reference osisRef="Heb.7.25">Hebrews 7:25</reference>; <reference osisRef="1John.2.1">1 John 2:1</reference> The enemies themselves
   of the church's eternal welfare -- namely, sin, death, the world,
   Satan, and hell -- he subdues by his power. In the gradual
   accomplishment of this work -- according as the church of the elect is
   brought forth in successive generations (in every one of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the same
   work is to be performed) -- he is to continue to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end and
   consummation of all things. Until then the whole church will not be
   saved, and therefore his work not be finished. He will not cease his
   work whilst there is one of his elect to be saved, or one enemy to be
   subdued. He shall not faint nor give over until he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> sent forth
   judgement to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> victory.
				</p><p>
   For the discharge of this work he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a sovereign power over all
   things in heaven and earth committed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> and must
   reign. And so absolutely is it vested in him, that upon the ceasing of
   the exercise of it, he himself is said to be made subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. It
   is true that the Lord Christ, in his human nature, is always less than,
   or inferior to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, God, even the Father. In that sense he is in
   subjection to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him now in heaven. But yet he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> an actual exercise
   of divine power, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he is absolute and supreme. When this ceases<note n="ceaseth">Auto-modernized</note>,
   he shall be subject to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father in that nature, and only so.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, when this work is perfectly fulfilled and ended, then shall
   all the mediatory acting of Christ cease for evermore. For God will
   then have completely finished the whole design of his wisdom and grace
   in the constitution of his person and offices, and have raised up and
   finished the whole fabric of eternal glory. Then will God "be all in
   all". In his own immense nature and blessedness he shall not only be
   "all" essentially and causally, but "in all" also; he shall immediately
   be all in and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   This state of things -- when God shall immediately "be all in all" --
   we can have no just comprehension of in this life. Some refreshing
   notions of it may be framed in our minds, from these apprehensions of
   the divine perfections which reason can attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>; and their
   suitableness to yield eternal rest, satisfaction, and blessedness, in
   that enjoyment of them of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> our nature is capable. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, of these
   things in particular the Scripture is silent; however, it testifies our
   eternal reward and blessedness to consist alone in the enjoyment of
   God.
				</p><p>
   But there is somewhat else proposed as the immediate object of the
   faith of the saints at present, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> what they shall enjoy upon
   their departure out of this world. And Scripture revelations extend
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the state of things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of the world, and no longer.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> heaven is now principally represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us as the place of
   the residence and glory of Jesus Christ in the administration of his
   office; and our blessedness to consist in a participation of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, and
   communion with him in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. So he prays for all them who are given him
   of his Father, that they may be where he is, to behold his glory, <reference osisRef="John.17.24">John 17:24</reference> It is not the essential glory of his divine person that he
   intends, which is absolutely the same with that of the Father; but it
   is a glory that is peculiarly his own, -- a glory which the Father has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   given him, because he loved him: "My glory, which thou hast given me;
   for thou lovedst me." Nor is it merely the glorified state of his human
   nature that he intends<note n="intendeth">Auto-modernized</note>; as was before declared in the consideration
   of the 5^th verse of this chapter, where he prays<note n="prayeth">Auto-modernized</note> for this glory.
   However, this is not excluded; for to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all those that love him, it
   will be no small portion of their blessed refreshment, to behold that
   individual nature in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he suffered for them, undergoing all sorts of
   reproaches, contempts, and miseries, now unchangeably stated in
   incomprehensible glory. But the glory which God gives to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, in
   the phase of the Scripture, principally is the glory of his exaltation
   in his mediatory office. It is the "all power" that is given him in
   heaven and earth; the "name" that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> "above every name," as he
   sits on the right hand of the Majesty on high. In the beholding and
   contemplation of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> with holy joy and delight, consists no small part
   of that blessedness and glory which the saints above at present enjoy,
   and which all others of them shall so do who depart this life before
   the consummation of all things. And in the due consideration of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   consists a great part of the exercise of that faith which is "the
   evidence of things not seen," and which, by making them present to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, supplies the room of sight. This is the ground whereon our hope
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> anchor, -- namely, the things "within the veil," <reference osisRef="Heb.6.19">Hebrews 6:19</reference>,
   which directs us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the temple administration of the mediatory office
   of Christ. And it is for the strengthening of our faith and hope in
   God, through him, that we do and that we ought to inquire into these
   things.
				</p><p>
   The consideration of the present state of Christ in heaven may be
   reduced to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> three heads: 
				</p><p>
   I. The glorification of his human nature; what it has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> in common with,
   and in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it differs in kind from, the glory of all saints whatever.
				</p><p>
   II. His mediatory exaltation; or the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> glory of his person as
   mediator.
				</p><p>
   III. The exercise and discharge of his office in the state of things:
   which is what at present I shall principally inquire into. I shall not
   speak at all of the nature of glorified bodies, nor of anything that is
   common to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human nature of Christ and the same nature in glorified
   saints; but only what is peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself. And to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> I shall
   premise one general observation.
				</p><p>
   All perfections of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> human nature is capable, abiding what it was in
   both the essential path of it, soul and body, do belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord
   Christ in his glorified state. To ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it what is inconsistent
   with its essence, is not an assignation of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its state and
   condition, but a destruction of its being. To affix to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human
   nature divine properties, as ubiquity or immensity, is to deprive it of
   its own. The essence of his body is no more changed than that of his
   soul. It is a fundamental article of faith, that he is in the same body
   in heaven in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he conversed here on earth; as well as the faculties
   of his rational soul are continued the same in him. This is that "holy
   thing" which was framed immediately by the Holy Ghost, in the womb of
   the Virgin. This is that "Holy One" which, when it was in the grave,
   saw no corruption. This is that "body" which was offered for us,
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he bare our sins on the tree. To fancy any such change in or of
   this body, by its glorification, as that it should not continue
   essentially and substantially the same that it was is to overthrow the
   faith of the church in a principal article of it. We believe that the
   very same body in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he suffered for us, without any alteration as
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its substance, essence, or integral parts, and not another body,
   of an ethereal, heavenly structure, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> is nothing of flesh, blood,
   or bones, by which he so frequently testified the faithfulness of God
   in his incarnation, is still that temple in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God dwells, and
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he administers in the holy place not made with hands. The body
   which was pierced is that which all eyes shall see, and no other.
				</p><p>
   I. On this foundation I willingly allow all perfections in the
   glorified human nature of Christ, which are consistent with its real
   form and essence. I shall, therefore, only in some instances inquire
   into the present glory of the human nature of Christ, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it differ
   either in kind or degree from the glory of all other saints whatever.
   For even among them I freely allow different degrees in glory; which
   the eternal order of things -- that is, the will of God, in the
   disposal of all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own glory -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> require.
				</p><p>
   1. There is that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the present glory of the human nature of
   Christ differs<note n="differeth">Auto-modernized</note>, in kind and nature, from that which any other of the
   saints are partakers of, or shall be so after the resurrection. And
   this is, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) The eternal subsistence of that nature of his in the person of the
   Son of God. As this belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its dignity and honour, so it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   also to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> its inherent glory. This is, and shall be, eternally peculiar
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, in distinction from, and exaltation above, the whole creation
   of God, angels and men. Those by whom this is denied, instead of the
   glorious name through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> call him, -- "Wonderful, Counsellor, The
   mighty God," etc.., -- do call him "Ichabod," "Where is the glory?" or,
   there is none that is peculiar to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. But the mystery of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>,
   according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our measure, and in answer to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our design, we have
   already declared. And this glory he had, indeed, in this world, from
   the first instant of his incarnation, or conception in the womb. But,
   as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the demonstration of it, "he emptied himself," and made himself
   of no reputation, under the form of a servant. But now the glory of it
   is illustriously displayed in the sight of all his holy ones. Some
   inquire, whether the saints in heaven do perfectly comprehend the
   mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God? I do not well understand
   what is meant by "perfectly comprehend;" but this is certain, that what
   we have now by faith, we shall have there by sight. For as we live now
   by faith, so shall we there by sight. No finite creature can have an
   absolute comprehension of that which is infinite. We shall never search
   out the almighty to perfection, in any of his works of infinite wisdom.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> this only I shall say, there is such a satisfactory evidence
   in heaven, not only of the truth, but also of the nature of this
   mystery, as that the glory of Christ in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is manifest, as an eternal
   object of divine adoration and honour. The enjoyment of heaven is
   usually called the beatifical vision; that is, such an intellectual
   present view, apprehension, and sight of God and his glory, especially
   as manifested in Christ, as will make us blessed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, in the contemplation of this mystery does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> a great part of
   our blessedness consist; and farther our thoughts cannot attain. This
   is that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of the human nature of Christ does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   essentially excel, and differ from that of any other blessed creature
   whatever. And upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> other things do depend. For, --
				</p><p>
   (2.) Hence the union of the human nature of Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and the
   communications of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, are of another kind than those of the
   blessed saints. In these things -- namely, our union with God and his
   communications to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us -- do our blessedness and glory consist.
				</p><p>
   In this world, believers are united to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by faith. It is by faith
   that they cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him with purpose of heart. In heaven, it shall be
   by love. Ardent love, with delight, complacency, and joy, from a clear
   apprehension of God's infinite goodness and beauty, now made present
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, now enjoyed by us, shall be the principle of our eternal
   adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, and union with him. His communications to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us here
   are by an external efficiency of power. He communicates of himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   us, in the effects of his goodness, grace, and mercy, by the operations
   of his Spirit in us. Of the same kind will all the communications of
   the divine nature be to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all eternity. It will be by what he
   works<note n="worketh">Auto-modernized</note> in us by his Spirit and power. There is no other way of the
   emanation of virtue from God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> any creature. But these things in
   Christ are of another nature. This union of his human nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God
   is immediate, in the person of the Son; ours is mediate, by the Son, as
   clothed with our nature. The way of the communications of the divine
   nature to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human in his person is what we cannot comprehend; we
   have no notion of it, -- nothing through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> it may be illustrated. There
   is nothing equal to it, nothing like it, in all the works of God. As it
   is a creature, it must subsist in eternal dependence on God; neither
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> it anything but what it receives from him. For this belongs
   essentially to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine nature, to be the only independent, eternal
   spring and fountain of all being and goodness. Nor can Omnipotency
   itself exalt a creature into any such condition as that it should not
   always and in all things depend absolutely on the Divine Being. But as
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the way of the communications between the divine and human nature,
   in the personal union, we know it not. But whether they be of life,
   power, light, or glory, they are of another kind than that through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we
   do or shall receive all things. For all things are given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, are
   wrought in us, as was said, by an external efficiency of power. The
   glorious immediate emanations of virtue, from the divine to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the human
   nature of Christ, we understand not. Indeed, the acting of natures of
   different kinds, where both are finite, in the same person, one towards
   the other, is of a difficult apprehension. Who knows how directive
   power and efficacy proceeds from the soul, and is communicated to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   body, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> every the least minute action, in every member of it, -- so
   as that there is no distance between the direction and the action, or
   the accomplishment of it? or how, on the other hand, the soul is
   affected with sorrow or trouble in the moment in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the body feels<note n="feeleth">Auto-modernized</note>
   pain, so as that no distinction can be made between the body's
   sufferings and the soul's sorrow? How much more is this mutual
   communication in the same person of diverse natures above our
   comprehension, where one of them is absolutely infinite! Somewhat will
   be spoken to it afterward. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this eternal glory differ
   from that of all other glorified creatures whatever. And, --
				</p><p>
   (3.) Hence the human nature of Christ, in his divine person and
   together with it, is the object of all divine adoration and worship,
   <reference osisRef="Rev.5.13">Revelation of John 5:13</reference> All creatures whatever do forever ascribe "blessing,
   honour, glory, and power, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb," in the same manner as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him who sits on the throne. This we have declared before. But no other
   creature either is, or ever can be, exalted into such a condition of
   glory as to be the object of any divine worship, from the meanest
   creature which is capable of the performance of it. Those who ascribe
   divine or religious honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints or angels, as is done in the
   Church of Rome, do both rob Christ of the principal flower of his
   imperial crown, and sacrilegiously attempt to adorn others with it; --
   which they abhor.
				</p><p>
   (4.) The glory that God designed to accomplish in and by him, is now
   made evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the holy ones that are about the throne. The
   great design of the wisdom and grace of God, from eternity, was to
   declare and manifest all the holy, glorious properties of his nature,
   in and by Jesus Christ. And this is that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he will acquiesce,
   with which he is well pleased. When this is fully accomplished, he will
   use no other way or means for the manifestation of his glory. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is
   the end and blessedness of all.
				</p><p>
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the principal work of faith, whilst we are in this world, is
   to behold this glory of God, as so represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in Christ. In
   the exercise of faith in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is our conformity to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Him carried on
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> perfection, <reference osisRef="2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</reference> And to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end, or that we may do
   so, he powerfully communicates to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our minds a saving, internal light;
   without which we can neither behold his glory nor give glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
   He "who commanded the light to shine out of darkness," shines into our
   hearts, to give us "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
   the face of Jesus Christ," <reference osisRef="2Cor.4.6">2 Corinthians 4:6</reference> The end, I say, why God
   communicates a spiritual, supernatural light to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the minds of
   believers, is that they may be able to discern the manifestation and
   revelation of his glory in Christ; which is hid from the world, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.17 Eph.1.18 Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:17-19</reference>; <reference osisRef="Col.2.2">Colossians 2:2</reference> Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, whilst we are here, we see it but "darkly
   as in a glass," it is not evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us in its own lustre and beauty.
   Yea, the remainder of our darkness in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is the cause of all our
   weakness, fears, and disconsolations. Want of a steady view of this
   glory of God, is that which exposes<note n="exposeth">Auto-modernized</note> us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> impressions from all our
   temptations. And the light of our minds in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> is that through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we are
   changed and transformed into the likeness of Christ.
				</p><p>
   But in heaven this is conspicuously and gloriously manifest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all
   the blessed ones that are before the throne of God. They do not behold
   it by faith in various degrees of light, as we do here below. They have
   not apprehensions of some impressions of divine glory on the person of
   Christ and the human nature in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, with the work which he did
   perform; which is the utmost of our attainment. But they behold openly
   and plainly the whole glory of God, all the characters of it,
   illustriously manifesting themselves in him, in what he is, in what he
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> done, in what he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>. Divine wisdom, grace, goodness, love,
   power, do all shine forth in him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the contemplation of all his
   saints, in whom he is admired. And in the vision of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> consists no
   small part of our eternal blessedness. For what can be more
   satisfactory, more full of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of believers, than
   clearly to comprehend the mystery of the wisdom, grace, and love of God
   in Christ? This is that which the prophets, at a great distance,
   inquired diligently into, -- that which the angels bow down to look
   towards, -- that whose declaration is the life and glory of the Gospel.
   To behold in one view the reality, the substance of all that was
   typified and represented by the beautiful fabric of the Tabernacle, and
   Temple which succeeded in the room of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>, -- of all the utensils of
   them, and services performed in them, -- all that the promises of the
   Old Testament did contain, or the declarations of the New; -- as it is
   the most satisfactory, blessed, and glorious state, that by the present
   light of faith we can desire or long for, so it evidences<note n="evidenceth">Auto-modernized</note> a glory in
   Christ of another kind and nature than what any creature can be
   participant in. I shall therefore state it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our consideration, with
   some few observations concerning it.
				</p><p>
   [1.] Every believer sees here in this life an excellency, a glory in
   the mystery of God in Christ. They do so in various degrees, unless it
   be in times of temptation, when any of them walk in darkness, and have
   no light. The view and prospect to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> is far more clear, and
   accompanied with more evidence, in some than in others, according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the various degrees of their faith and light. The spiritual sight of
   some is very weak, and their views of the glory of God in Christ are
   much obscured with inevidence, darkness, and instability. This in many
   is occasioned by the weakness of their natural ability, in more by
   spiritual sloth and negligence, -- in that they have not habitually
   "exercised their senses to discern good and evil," as the apostle
   speaks, <reference osisRef="Heb.5.14">Hebrews 5:14</reference> Some want instruction, and some have their minds
   corrupted by false opinions. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, all true believers have the "eyes
   of their understanding opened" to discern, in some measure, the glory
   of God, as represented to them in the Gospel. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> others it is
   foolishness; or they think there is that darkness in it to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> they
   cannot approach. But all the darkness is in themselves. This is the
   distinguishing property and character of saving faith -- it beholds the
   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; -- it makes us to discern the
   manifestation of the glory of God in Christ, as declared in the Gospel.
				</p><p>
   [2.] Our apprehension of this glory is the spring of all our obedience,
   consolation, and hope in this world. Faith discovering this
   manifestation of the glory of God in Christ, engages<note n="engageth">Auto-modernized</note> the soul to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   universal obedience, as finding in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> abundant reason for it and
   encouragement to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. Then is obedience truly evangelical, when it
   arises from this acting of faith, and is upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> accompanied with
   liberty and gratitude. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is laid all the foundation of our
   consolations for the present and hope for the future. For the whole
   security of our present and future condition depends on the acting of
   God towards us, according as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested himself in Christ.
				</p><p>
   [3.] From the exercise of faith in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> divine love, love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God,
   proceed; in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> alone it is enlivened and inflamed. On these
   apprehensions does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> a believing soul cry out, "How great is his
   goodness! how great is his beauty!" God in Christ reconciling the world
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, is the only object of divine love. Under that
   representation of him alone can the soul cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him with ardent
   love, constant delight, and intense affections. All other notions of
   love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in sinners, as we are all, are empty fancies. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>,
   --
				</p><p>
   [4.] All believers are, or should be, conversant in their minds about
   these things, with longings, expectations, and desires after nearer
   approaches to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, and enjoyments of them. And if we are not so, we
   are earthly, carnal, and unspiritual; yea, the want of this frame --
   the neglect of this duty -- is the sole cause why many professors are
   so carnal in their minds, and so worldly in their conversions. But this
   is the state of them who live in the due exercise of faith, -- this
   they pant and breathe after, -- namely, that they may be delivered from
   all darkness, unstable thoughts, and imperfect apprehensions of the
   glory of God in Christ. After these things do those who have received
   the "first fruits of the Spirit," groan within themselves. This glory
   they would behold "with open face;" not, as at present, "in a glass,"
   but in its own beauty. What do we want? what would we be at? what do
   our souls desire? It is not that we might have a more full, clear,
   stable comprehension of the wisdom, love, grace, goodness, holiness,
   righteousness, and power of God, as declared and exalted in Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   our redemption and eternal salvation? To see the glory of God in
   Christ, to understand his love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him and valuation of him, to
   comprehend his nearness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, -- all evidenced in his mediation, --
   is that which he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> promised to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, and which we are pressing
   after. See <reference osisRef="John.17.23 John.17.24">John 17:23-24</reference>
				</p><p>
   [5.] Heaven will satisfy all those desires and expectations. To have
   them fully satisfied, is heaven and eternal blessedness. This fills the
   souls of them who are already departed in the faith, with admiration,
   joy, and praises. See <reference osisRef="Rev.5.9 Rev.5.10">Revelation of John 5:9-10</reference> In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is the glory of Christ
   absolutely of another kind and nature than that of any other creature
   whatever. And from hence it is that our glory shall principally consist
   in beholding his glory, because the whole glory of God is manifested in
   him.
				</p><p>
   And, by the way, we may see hence the vanity as well as the idolatry of
   them who would represent Christ in glory as the object of our adoration
   in pictures and images. They fashion wood or stone into the likeness of
   a man. They adorn it with colours and flourishes of art, to set it
   forth to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the senses and fancies of superstitious persons as having a
   resemblance of glory. And when they have done, "they lavish gold out of
   the bag," as the prophet speaks, in various sorts of supposed
   ornaments, -- such as are so only to the vainest sort of mankind, --
   and so propose it as an image or resemblance of Christ in glory. But
   what is there in it that has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the least respect to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, -- the least
   likeness of it? nay, is it not the most effectual means that can be
   devised to divert the minds of men from true and real apprehensions of
   it? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it teach anything of the subsistence of the human nature of
   Christ in the person of the Son of God? nay, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it not obliterate all
   thoughts of it! What is represented thereby of the union of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, and the immediate communications of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it? Does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it declare
   the manifestation of all the glorious properties of the divine nature
   in him? One thing, indeed, they ascribe to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it that is proper to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   Christ, -- namely, that it is to be adored and worshipped; through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they
   add idolatry to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their folly. Persons who know not what it is to live
   by faith -- whose minds are never raised by spiritual, heavenly
   contemplations, who have no design in religion but to gratify their
   inward superstition by their outward senses -- may be pleased for a
   time, and ruined for ever, by these delusions. Those who have real
   faith in Christ, and love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, have a more glorious object for
   their exercise.
				</p><p>
   And we may hereby examine both our own notions of the state of glory
   and our preparations for it, and whether we are in any measure "made
   meet for the inheritance of the saints in light." More grounds of this
   trial will be afterward suggested; these laid down may not be passed
   by. Various are the thoughts of men about the future state, -- the
   things which are not seen, which are eternal. Some rise no higher but
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> hopes of escaping hell, or everlasting miseries, when they die.
   Yet the heathen had their Elysian fields, and Mohammed his sensual
   paradise. Others have apprehensions of I know not what glistering
   glory, that will please and satisfy them, they know not how, when they
   can be here no longer. But this state is quite of another nature, and
   the blessedness of it is spiritual and intellectual. Take an instance
   in one of the things before laid down. The glory of heaven consists in
   the full manifestation of divine wisdom, goodness, grace, holiness, --
   of all the properties of the nature of God in Christ. In the clear
   perception and constant contemplation of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> consists no small part of
   eternal blessedness. What, then, are our present thoughts of these
   things? What joy, what satisfaction have we in the sight of them, which
   we have by faith through divine revelation? What is our desire to come
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the perfect comprehension of them? How do we like this heaven?
   What do we find in ourselves that will be eternally satisfied hereby?
   According as our desires are after them, such and no other are our
   desires of the true heaven, -- of the residence of blessedness and
   glory. Neither will God bring us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> heaven whether we will or no. If,
   through the ignorance and darkness of our minds, -- if, through the
   earthliness and sensuality of our affections, -- if, through a fulness
   of the world, and the occasions of it, -- if, by the love of life and
   our present enjoyments, we are strangers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these things, we are not
   conversant about them, we long not after them, -- we are not in the way
   towards their enjoyment. The present satisfaction we receive in them by
   faith, is the best evidence we have of an indefeasible interest in
   them. How foolish is it to lose the first fruits of these things in our
   own souls, -- those entrances into blessedness which the contemplation
   of them through faith would open to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, -- and hazard our everlasting
   enjoyment of them by an eager pursuit of an interest in perishing
   things here below! This, this is that which ruins the souls of most,
   and keeps the faith of many at so low an ebb, that it is hard to
   discover any genuine working of it.
				</p><p>
   2. The glory of the human nature of Christ differs from that of the
   saints after the resurrection, in things which concern the degrees of
   it. For, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) The glory of his body is the example and pattern of what they
   shall be conformed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>: "Who shall change our vile body, that it may
   be fashioned like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his glorious body, according to the working
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he is able even to subdue all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself," <reference osisRef="Phil.3.21">Philippians 3:21</reference> Our bodies were made vile by the entrance of sin; thence they
   became brothers to the worms, and sisters to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> corruption. To death and
   the grave, with rottenness and corruption in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>, they are designed.
   At the resurrection they shall be new-framed, fashioned, and moulded.
   Not only all the detriment and disadvantage they received by the
   entrance of sin shall be removed, but many additions of glorious
   qualifications, which they had not in their primitive, natural
   constitution, shall be added to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. And this shall be done by the
   almighty power of Christ, -- that working or exercise of it through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he
   is able to subdue all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself. But of the state into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note>
   we shall be changed by the power of Christ, his own body is the pattern
   and example. A similitude of it is all that we shall attain to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. And
   that which is the idea and exemplar in any state, is the rule and
   standard to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all others. Such is the glory of Christ; -- ours consists
   in conformity to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>; which gives him the pre-eminence.
				</p><p>
   (2.) As the state of his body is more glorious than ours shall be, so
   will that of his soul in itself be made appear to be more excellent
   than what we are capable of. For that fulness of the Spirit without
   measure and of all grace, which his nature was capacitated for by
   virtue of the hypostatical union, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> now shine forth in all
   excellency and glory. The grace that was in Christ in this world is the
   same with that which is in him now in heaven. The nature of it was not
   changed when he ceased to be viator, but is only brought into a more
   glorious exercise now he is comprehensor. And all his graces are now
   made manifest, the veil being taken from them, and light communicated
   to discern them. As, in this world, he had to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the most neither form
   nor comeliness for which he should be desired, -- partly from the veil
   which was cast on his inward beauty from his outward condition, but
   principally from the darkness which was on their minds, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they
   were disenabled to discern the glory of spiritual things;
   (notwithstanding which, some then, in the light of faith, "beheld his
   glory, as the glory of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace
   and truth;") -- so now the veil is removed, and the darkness wholly
   taken away from the minds of the saints, he is in the glory of his
   grace altogether lovely and desirable. And although the grace which is
   in believers be of the same nature with that which is in Christ Jesus,
   and shall be changed into glory after the likeness of his; yet is it,
   and always shall be, incomprehensibly short of what dwells in him. And
   in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> also does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> his glory gradually [greatly?] excel that of all other
   creatures whatever.
				</p><p>
   But we must here draw a veil over what yet remains. For it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not yet
   appear what we ourselves shall be; much less is it evident what are,
   and what will be, the glories of the Head above all the members, --
   even then when we shall "be made like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him." But it must be
   remembered, that whereas, at the entrance of this discourse, we so
   proposed the consideration of the present state of the Lord Christ in
   heaven, as that which should have an "end at the consummation of all
   things;" what has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been spoken concerning the glory of his human nature
   in itself, is not of that kind but what abides<note n="abideth">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity. All the
   things mentioned abide in him and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for evermore.
				</p><p>
   II. The second thing to be considered in the present state and
   condition of Christ is his mediatory exaltation. And two things with
   respect to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> may be inquired into: 1. The way of his entrance into
   that state above; 2. The state itself, with the glory of it.
				</p><p>
   1. The way of his entrance into the exercise of his mediatory office in
   heaven is expressed, <reference osisRef="1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</reference>, He was "received up into glory,"
   or rather gloriously; and he entered "into his glory," <reference osisRef="Luke.24.26">Luke 24:26</reference>
   This assumption and entrance into glory was upon his ascension,
   described <reference osisRef="Acts.1.9 Acts.1.10 Acts.1.11">Acts 1:9-11</reference> "He was taken up into heaven," anelephthe en
   doxe, by an act of divine power; and he went into heaven, eiselthein
   eis ten doxan, in his own choice and will, as that which he was exalted
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. And this ascension of Christ in his human nature into heaven is a
   fundamental article of the faith of the church. And it falls under a
   double consideration: (1.) As it was triumphant, as he was a King; (2.)
   As it was gracious, as he was a Priest. His ascension, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> change
   of place, from earth to heaven, and as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the outward manner of it,
   was one and the same, and at once accomplished; but as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the end of
   it, which is the exercise of all his offices, it had various respects,
   various prefigurations, and is distinctly proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us with
   reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
				</p><p>
   (1.) In his ascension, as it was triumphant, three things may be
   considered: 1^st, The manner of it, with its representation of old;
   2^dly, The place into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> he ascended; 3^dly, The end of it, or what
   was the work which he had to do upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   [1.] As to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the manner of it, it was openly triumphant and glorious.
   So is it described, <reference osisRef="Eph.4.8">Ephesians 4:8</reference>, "When he ascended up on high, he led
   captivity captive, and gave gifts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men." And respect is had to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the prefiguration of it at the giving of the law, <reference osisRef="Ps.68.17 Ps.68.18">Psalms 68:17-18</reference>,
   where the glory of it is more fully expressed, "The chariots of God are
   twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as
   in Sinai, in the holy place. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led
   captivity captive," etc.. The most glorious appearance of God upon the
   earth, under the Old Testament, was that on Mount Sinai, in the giving
   of the law. And as his presence was there attended with all his
   glorious angels, so, when, upon the finishing of that work, he returned
   or ascended into heaven, it was in the way of a triumph with all that
   royal attendance. And this prefigured the ascent of Christ into heaven,
   upon his fulfilling of the law, all that was required in it, or
   signified by it. He ascended triumphantly after he had given the law,
   as a figure of his triumphant ascent after he had fulfilled it. Having
   then "spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly,
   triumphing over them," <reference osisRef="Col.2.15">Colossians 2:15</reference> So he led captivity captive; or all
   the adverse powers of the salvation of the church, in triumph at his
   chariot wheels. I deny not but that his leading "captivity captive"
   principally respects his spiritual conquest over Satan, and the
   destruction of his power; yet, whereas he is also said to "spoil
   principalities and powers, making a show of them openly," and
   triumphing over them, I no way doubt but Satan, the head of the
   apostasy, and the chief princes of darkness, were led openly, in sight
   of all the holy angels, as conquered captives, -- the "seed of the
   woman" having now bruised the "head of the serpent." This is that which
   is so emphatically expressed, Ps. xlvii. throughout. The ground and
   cause of all the triumphant rejoicing of the church, in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> declared,
   is, that God was "gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a
   trumpet,"verse 5 , which is nothing but the glorious ascent of Christ
   into heaven, said to be accompanied with shouts and the sound of a
   trumpet, the expressions of triumphant rejoicing, because of the
   glorious acclamations that were made upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, by all the attendants of
   the throne of God.
				</p><p>
   [2.] The place whither he thus ascended is on high. "He ascended up on
   high," <reference osisRef="Eph.4.8">Ephesians 4:8</reference>, -- that is, heaven. He went "into heaven," <reference osisRef="Acts.1.11">Acts 1:11</reference>, -- and the "heaven must receive him," <reference osisRef="Acts.3.21">Acts 3:21</reference>; not these
   aspectable heavens which we behold, -- for in his ascension "he passed
   through them," [7] <reference osisRef="Heb.4.14">Hebrews 4:14</reference>, and is made "higher than they," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26">Hebrews 7:26</reference>, -- but into the place of the residence of God in glory and
   majesty, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>, <reference osisRef="Heb.8.1">Hebrews 8:1</reference>, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.2">Hebrews 12:2</reference> There, on "the throne of God,"
   <reference osisRef="Rev.3.21">Revelation of John 3:21</reference>, -- "on the right hand of the Majesty on high," -- he sits
   down in the full possession and exercise of all power and authority.
   This is the palace of this King of saints and nations. There is his
   royal eternal throne, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.8">Hebrews 1:8</reference> And "many crowns" are on his head,
   <reference osisRef="Rev.19.12">Revelation of John 19:12</reference>, -- or all dignity and honour. And he who, in a pretended
   imitation of him, wears a triple crown, has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> upon his own head thereby,
   "the name of blasphemy," <reference osisRef="Rev.13.1">Revelation of John 13:1</reference> There are before him his
   "sceptre of righteousness," his "rod of iron," -- all the regalia of
   his glorious kingdom. For by these emblems of power does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the Scripture
   represent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us his sovereign, divine authority in the execution of
   his kingly office. Thus he ascended triumphantly, having conquered his
   enemies; thus he reigns<note n="reigneth">Auto-modernized</note> gloriously over all.
				</p><p>
   [3.] The end for which he thus triumphantly ascended into heaven, is
   twofold: -- 1^st, The overturning and destruction of all his enemies in
   all their remaining powers. He rules them "with a rod of iron," and in
   his due time will "dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel," <reference osisRef="Ps.2.9">Psalms 2:9</reference>; for he must "reign until all his enemies are made his footstool," <reference osisRef="1Cor.15.25 1Cor.15.26">1 Corinthians 15:25-26</reference>; <reference osisRef="Ps.110.1">Psalms 110:1</reference> Although at present, for the most part,
   they despise his authority, yet they are all absolutely in his power,
   and shall fall under his eternal displeasure. 2^dly, The preservation,
   continuation, and rule of his church, both as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the internal state
   of the souls of them that believe, and the external order of the church
   in its worship and obedience, and its preservation under and from all
   oppositions and persecutions in this world. There is in each of these
   such a continual exercise of divine wisdom, power, and care, -- the
   effects of them are so great and marvellous, and the fruits of them so
   abundant to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God, -- that the world would "not contain
   the books that might be written" of them; but to handle them distinctly
   is not our present design.
				</p><p>
   (2.) His ascension may be considered as gracious, as the ascent of a
   High Priest. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> the things before mentioned are of a distinct
   consideration.
				</p><p>
   [1.] As to the manner of it, and the design of it, he gives an account
   of them himself, <reference osisRef="John.20.17">John 20:17</reference> His design in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> was not the taking on
   him the exercise of his power, kingdom, and glorious rule; but the
   acting with God on the behalf of his disciples. "I go," says<note n="saith">Auto-modernized</note> he, "to
   my Father, and to your Father; to my God, and to your God," -- not his
   God and Father with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternal generation, but as he was
   their God and Father also. And he was so, as he was their God and
   Father in the same covenant with himself; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he was to procure of
   God all good things for them. Through the blood of this everlasting
   covenant -- namely, his own blood, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> this covenant was
   established, and all the good things of it secured to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church --
   he was "brought again from the dead" that he might live ever to
   communicate them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church, <reference osisRef="Heb.13.20 Heb.13.21">Hebrews 13:20-21</reference> With this design
   in his ascension, and the effects of it, did he often comfort and
   refresh the hearts of his disciples, when they were ready to faint on
   the apprehensions of his leaving of them here below, <reference osisRef="John.14.1 John.14.2">John 14:1-2</reference>,
   xvi. 5-7. And this was typified by the ascent of the high priest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the temple of old. The temple was situated on a hill, high and steep,
   so as that there was no approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it but by stairs. Hence in their
   wars it was looked on as a most impregnable fortress. And the solemn
   ascent of the high priest into it on the day of expiation, had a
   resemblance of this ascent of Christ into heaven. For after he had
   offered the sacrifices in the outward court, and made atonement for
   sin, he entered into the most holy place, -- a type of heaven itself,
   as the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.24">Hebrews 9:24</reference>, -- of heaven, as it was the place
   into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> our High Priest was to enter. And it was a joyful ascent,
   though not triumphant. All the Psalms, from the 120^th to the 134^th
   inclusively, whose titles are shyry hmlvt, "Songs of Degrees," or
   rather ascents or risings -- being generally songs of praise and
   exhortations to have respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the sanctuary -- were sung to God at
   the resting-places of that ascent. Especially was this represented on
   the day of jubilee. The proclamation of the jubilee was on the same day
   that the high priest entered into the holy place; and at the same time,
   -- namely, on the "tenth day of the seventh month," <reference osisRef="Lev.16.29">Leviticus 16:29</reference>, xxv.
   9. Then did the trumpet sound throughout the land, the whole church;
   and liberty was proclaimed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all servants, captives, and such as had
   sold their possessions that they might return to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them again. This
   being a great type of the spiritual deliverance of the church, the
   noise of the trumpet was called "The joyful sound," <reference osisRef="Ps.89.15">Psalms 89:15</reference>,
   "Blessed are the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, O
   Lord, in the light of thy countenance." Those who are made partakers of
   spiritual deliverance, shall walk before God in a sense of his love and
   grace. This is the ascent of our High Priest into his sanctuary, when
   he proclaimed "the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of
   vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them
   that mourn in Zion, to give to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy
   for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that
   they might be called Trees of righteousness, The planting of the Lord,
   that he might be glorified," <reference osisRef="Isa.61.2 Isa.61.3">Isaiah 61:2-3</reference> For in this ascension of
   Christ, proclamation was made in the Gospel, of mercy, pardon, peace,
   joy, and everlasting refreshments, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all that were distressed by
   sin, with a communication of righteousness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, to the eternal
   glory of God. Such was the entrance of our High Priest into heaven,
   with acclamations of joy and praise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God.
				</p><p>
   [2.] The place into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> he thus entered was the sanctuary above, the
   "tabernacle not made with hands," <reference osisRef="Heb.9.11">Hebrews 9:11</reference> It was into heaven
   itself, not absolutely, but as it is the temple of God, as the throne
   of grace and mercy-seat are in it; which must farther be spoken to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   immediately.
				</p><p>
   [3.] The end why the Lord Christ thus ascended, and thus entered into
   the holy place, was "to appear in the presence of God for us," and to
   "make intercession for all that come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by him," <reference osisRef="Heb.7.26 Heb.7.27">Hebrews 7:26-27</reference>, ix. 24, 25.
				</p><p>
   He ascended triumphantly into heaven, as Solomon ascended into his
   glorious throne of judgement described <reference osisRef="1Kgs.10.18 1Kgs.10.19 1Kgs.10.20">1 Kings 10:18-20</reference> As David was
   the type of his conquest over all the enemies of his church, so was
   Solomon of his glorious reign. The types were multiplied because of
   their imperfection. Then came to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him the queen of Sheba, the type of
   the Gentile converts and the church; when ndyvy mym, the "voluntaries
   of the people," (those made willing in the day of his power, <reference osisRef="Ps.110.3">Psalms 110:3</reference>,) "gathered themselves to the people of the God of Abraham," and were
   taken in his covenant, <reference osisRef="Ps.47.9">Psalms 47:9</reference> -- margin. But he ascended
   graciously, as the high priest went into the holy place; not to rule
   all things gloriously with mighty power, not to use his sword and his
   sceptre -- but to appear as an high priest, in a garment down to the
   foot, and a golden girdle about his paps, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.13">Revelation of John 1:13</reference>, -- as in a
   tabernacle, or temple, before a throne of grace. His sitting down at
   the right hand of the Majesty on high adds to the glory of his priestly
   office, but belongs not to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the execution of it. So it was prophesied
   of him, that he should be "a priest upon his throne," <reference osisRef="Zech.6.13">Zechariah 6:13</reference>
				</p><p>
   It may be added to this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note>, that when he thus left this world and
   ascended into glory, the great promise he made to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his disciples -- as
   they were to be preachers of the Gospel, and in them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all that
   should succeed them in that office -- was, that he would "send the Holy
   Spirit to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them," to teach and guide them, to lead them into all
   truth, -- to declare to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them the mysteries of the will, grace, and
   love of God, for the use of the whole church. This he promised to do,
   and did, in the discharge of his prophetical office. And although his
   giving "gifts to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> men" was an act of his kingly power, yet it was for
   the end of his prophetical office.
				</p><p>
   From what has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been spoken, it is evident that the Lord Christ
   "ascended into heaven," or was received up into glory, with this
   design, -- namely, to exercise his office of mediation in the behalf of
   the church, until the end should be. As this was his grace, that when
   he was rich, for our sakes he became poor; so when he was made rich
   again for his own sake, he lays forth all the riches of his glory and
   power on our behalf.
				</p><p>
   2. The glory of the state and condition into which<note n="whereinto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ thus entered
   is the next thing to be considered; for he is set down at the right
   hand of the Majesty on high. And as his ascension, with the ends of it,
   were twofold, or of a double consideration, so was his glory that
   ensued upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. For his present mediatory state consists either in the
   glory of his power and authority, or, in the glory of his love and
   grace, -- his glory as a King, or his glory as a Priest. For the first
   of these, or his royal glory, in sovereign power and authority over the
   whole creation of God, -- all in heaven and earth, persons and things,
   angels and men, good and bad, alive and dead, -- all things spiritual
   and eternal, grace, gifts, and glory; -- his right and power, or
   ability to dispose of all things according to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his will and pleasure,
   I have so fully and distinctly declared it, in my exposition on <reference osisRef="Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</reference>, as that I shall not here again insist upon it. His present glory, in
   the way of love and grace, -- his glory as a Priest, -- will be
   manifested in what does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> ensue.
</p>
<p>   [7] The expression quoted by Dr Owen is founded upon the phrase in the
   original language, dieleluthota tous ouranous "having passed through,"
   not "into the heavens," as it stands in our version. -- Ed.

</div>
<div type="chapter" osisID="Chapter 20 The Exercise of the Mediatory Office of Christ in Heaven">
<title>Chapter 20 The Exercise of the Mediatory Office of Christ in Heaven.</title>
<p>   III. The third and last thing which we proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> consideration, in
   our inquiry into the present state and condition of the person of
   Christ in heaven, is the exercise and discharge of his mediatory office
   in behalf of the church; -- especially as he continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> to be a
   "minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord
   pitched, and not man."
				</p><p>
   All Christians acknowledge that his present state is a state of the
   highest glory, -- of exaltation above the whole creation of God, above
   every name that is or can be named; and upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> they esteem their own
   honour and safety to depend. Neither do they doubt of his power, but
   take it for granted that he can do whatever he pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>; which is the
   ground of their placing all their confidence in him. But we must show,
   moreover, that his present state is a state of office-power, work, and
   duty. He leads not in heaven a life of mere glory, majesty, and
   blessedness, but a life of office, love, and care also. He lives as the
   Mediator of the church; as the King, Priest, and Prophet of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>.
   Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> do our present safety and our future eternal salvation depend.
   Without the continual acting of the office-power and care of Christ,
   the church could not be preserved one moment. And the darkness of our
   faith in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is the cause of oft our disconsolations, and most of our
   weaknesses in obedience. Most men have only general and confused
   notions and apprehensions of the present state of Christ, with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church. And by some, all considerations of this nature are
   despised and derided. But revealed things belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us; especially
   such as are of so great importance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God and the saving
   of our own souls, -- such as this is, concerning the present state of
   the person of Christ in heaven, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his office-power and
   care.
				</p><p>
   Thus he is at once represented in all his offices, <reference osisRef="Rev.5.6">Revelation of John 5:6</reference>, "And I
   beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living
   creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been
   slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits
   of God sent forth into all the earth." The whole representation of the
   glory of God, with all his holy attendants, is here called his
   "throne;" from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> Christ is said to be in the "midst" of it. And this he
   is in his kingly glory; with respect also to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> he is said to have
   "seven horns," or perfect power for the accomplishment of his will. And
   with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his sacerdotal office, he is represented as a "Lamb
   that had been slain;" it being the virtue of his oblation that is
   continually effectual for the salvation of the church. For, as the
   "Lamb of God," -- in the offering of himself, -- he "takes<note n="taketh">Auto-modernized</note> away the
   sin of the world." And as a prophet he is said to have "seven eyes,"
   which are "the seven Spirits of God;" or a perfect fulness of all
   spiritual light and wisdom in himself, with a power for the
   communication of gifts and grace for the illumination of the church.
				</p><p>
   The nature of these offices of Christ, what belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them and their
   charge, as was before intimated, I have declared elsewhere. I do now no
   farther consider them but as they relate to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the present state and
   condition of the person of Christ in heaven. And because it would be
   too long a work to treat of them all distinctly, I shall confine myself
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of his priestly office, with what depends
   upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>. And with respect to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> the things ensuing may be observed.
				</p><p>
   1. The Lord Christ entered into heaven, the place of the residence of
   the glory of God, as into a temple, a tabernacle, a place of sacred
   worship. He did so as the high priest of the church, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.24">Hebrews 9:24</reference> He
   "is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the
   figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the
   presence of God for us." He is entered into heaven, as it was figured
   by the tabernacle of old; which was the place of all sacred and solemn
   worship. And therefore is he said to enter into it "through the veil,"
   <reference osisRef="Heb.6.19 Heb.6.20">Hebrews 6:19-20</reference>, x. 19, 20; which was the way of entrance into the most
   holy place, both in the tabernacle and temple. Heaven is not only a
   palace, a throne, as it is God's throne, <reference osisRef="Matt.5.34">Matthew 5:34</reference>; but it is a
   temple, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God dwells, not only in majesty and power, but in grace
   and mercy. It is the seat of ordinances and solemn worship. So is it
   represented, <reference osisRef="Rev.7.15 Rev.7.17">Revelation of John 7:15, 17</reference> It is said of the whole number of the
   saints above that have passed through the tribulations of this world,
   that they are "before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in
   his temple, and he that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note> on the throne shall dwell among them;"
   and "the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and
   lead them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> living fountains of water." See also <reference osisRef="Rev.8.1 Rev.8.2 Rev.8.3 Rev.8.4">Revelation of John 8:1-4</reference>
   The worship of the church below may also be in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> comprised; but it is
   by virtue of communion with that above. This is that heaven which the
   souls of believers do long for an entrance into. Other apprehensions of
   it are but uncertain speculations.
				</p><p>
   2. In this temple, this sanctuary, the Lord Christ continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note>
   gloriously to minister before the throne of grace, in the discharge of
   his office. See <reference osisRef="Heb.4.14 Heb.4.15 Heb.4.16">Hebrews 4:14-16</reference> ix. 24. As the high priest went into
   the holy place to minister for the church to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, before the ark and
   mercy-seat, which were types of the throne of grace; so does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> our High
   Priest act for us in the real presence of God. He did not enter the
   holy place only to reside there in a way of glory, but to do
   temple-work, and to give to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God all that glory, honour, and worship,
   which he will receive from the church. And we may consider, both --
   (1.) What this work is, and (2.) How it is performed.
				</p><p>
   (1.) In general; in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> Christ exerts<note n="exerteth">Auto-modernized</note> and exercises<note n="exerciseth">Auto-modernized</note> all his love,
   compassion, pity, and care towards the church, and every member of it.
   This are we frequently called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consideration of, as the
   foundation of all our consolation, as the fountain of all our
   obedience. See <reference osisRef="Heb.2.17 Heb.2.18">Hebrews 2:17-18</reference>, iv. 15, 16, v. 2. Thoughts of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> are
   the relief of believers in all their distresses and temptations; and
   the effects of it are all their supplies of grace, enabling them to
   persevere in their obedience. He does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> appear for them as the great
   representative of the church, to transact all their affairs with God.
   And that for three ends.
				</p><p>
   First, To make effectual the atonement that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made for sin. By
   the continual representation of it, and of himself as a "Lamb that had
   been slain," he procures the application of the virtues and benefits of
   it, in reconciliation and peace with God, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their souls and
   consciences. Hence are all believers sprinkled and washed with his
   blood in all generations, -- in the application of the virtues of it
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, as shed for them.
				</p><p>
   Secondly, To undertake their protection, and to plead their cause
   against all the accusations of Satan. He yet accuses<note n="accuseth">Auto-modernized</note> and charges<note n="chargeth">Auto-modernized</note> them
   before God; but Christ is their advocate at the throne of grace,
   effectually frustrating all his attempts, <reference osisRef="Rev.12.10">Revelation of John 12:10</reference>; <reference osisRef="Zech.3.2">Zechariah 3:2</reference>
				</p><p>
   Thirdly, To intercede for them, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the communication of all grace
   and glory, all supplies of the Spirit, the accomplishment of all the
   promises of the covenant towards them, <reference osisRef="1John.2.1 1John.2.2">1 John 2:1-2</reference> This is the
   work of Christ in heaven. In these things, as the high priest of the
   church, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> he continue to administer his mediatory office on their
   behalf. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is he attended with the songs and joyful
   acclamations of all the holy ones that are in the presence of God,
   giving glory to God by him.
				</p><p>
   (2.) As to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the manner of this glorious administration, sundry things
   are to be considered.
				</p><p>
   [1.] That this transaction of things in heaven, being in the temple of
   God, and before the throne of grace, is a solemn instituted worship at
   present, which shall cease at the end of the world. Religious worship
   it is, or that in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> and through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> all the saints above do give glory
   to God. And it is instituted worship, not that which is merely natural,
   in that it is God's special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> appointment, in and by Christ the
   mediator. It is a church-state which is constituted hereby, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note>
   these glorious ordinances are celebrated; and such a state as shall not
   be eternal, but has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> its time allotted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. And believers at
   present have, by faith, an admission into communion with this church
   above, in all its divine worship. For we "are come to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> mount Zion, and
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
   innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of
   the first born, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of
   all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the
   mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that
   speaks<note n="speaketh">Auto-modernized</note> better things than that of Abel," <reference osisRef="Heb.12.22 Heb.12.23 Heb.12.24">Hebrews 12:22-24</reference> A
   church-state does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle most expressly represent to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. It is
   Zion, Jerusalem, the great assembly, -- the names of the church state
   under the Old Testament. And it is a state above, the heavenly
   Jerusalem, where are all the holy angels, and the spirits of just men
   made perfect in themselves, though not in their state as to the
   restitution of their bodies at the resurrection. And a holy worship is
   there in this great assembly; for not only is Jesus in it as the
   mediator of the covenant, but there is the "blood of sprinkling" also,
   in the effectual application of it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church. To this<note n="hereunto">Auto-modernized</note> have we an
   entrance. In this holy assembly and worship have we communion by faith
   whilst we are here below, <reference osisRef="Heb.10.19 Heb.10.20 Heb.10.21 Heb.10.22">Hebrews 10:19-22</reference> O that my soul might abide and
   abound in this exercise of faith! -- that I might yet enjoy a clearer
   prospect of this glory, and inspection into the beauty and order of
   this blessed assembly! How inconceivable is the representation that God
   here makes of the glory of his wisdom, love, grace, goodness, and
   mercy, in Christ! How excellent is the manifestation of the glory and
   honour of Christ in his person and offices! -- the glory given him by
   the Father! How little a portion do we know, or can have experience in,
   of the refreshing, satiating communications of divine love and
   goodness, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the members of this assembly; or of that
   unchangeable delight in beholding the glory of Christ, and of God in
   him, -- of that ardency of affections with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> they cleave to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him,
   and continual exultation of spirit, through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> they triumph in the praises
   of God, that are in all the members of it! To enter into this assembly
   by faith, -- to join with it in the assignation of praises to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> "him
   that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note> on the throne, and to the Lamb for evermore," -- to labour
   after a frame of heart in holy affections and spiritual delight in some
   correspondence with that which is in the saints above, -- is the duty,
   and ought to be the design, of the church of believers here below. So
   much as we are furthered and assisted in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> by our present ordinances,
   so much benefit and advantage have we by them, and no more. A constant
   view of this glory will cast contempt on all the desirable things of
   this world, and deliver our minds from any dreadful apprehensions of
   what is most terrible in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   [2.] This heavenly worship in the sanctuary above, administered by the
   High Priest over the house of God, is conspicuously glorious. The glory
   of God is the great end of it, as shall be immediately declared; that
   is, the manifestation of it. The manifestation of the glory of God
   consists really in the effects of his infinite wisdom, goodness, grace,
   and power; -- declaratively, in the express acknowledgement of it with
   praise. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, therefore, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the solemn worship of God in the
   sanctuary above consist, -- setting aside only the immediate acting of
   Christ in his intercession. It is a glorious, express acknowledgement
   of the wisdom, love, goodness, grace, and power of God, in the
   redemption, sanctification, and salvation of the church by Jesus
   Christ, with a continual ascription of all divine honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him in
   the way of praise. For the manner of its performance, our present light
   into it is but dark and obscure. Some things have an evidence in them.
   As, --
				</p><p>
   1^st, That there is nothing carnal in it, or such things as are suited
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the fancies and imaginations of men. In the thoughts of heaven,
   most persons are apt to frame images in their minds of such carnal
   things as they suppose they could be delighted withal. But they are far
   remote from the worship of this holy assembly. The worship of the
   Gospel, which is spiritually glorious, makes a nearer approach to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it
   than that of the Temple, which was outwardly and carnally so.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, It is not merely mental, or transacted only in the silent
   thoughts of each individual person; for, as we have showed, it is the
   worship of a church assembly in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they have all communion, and join
   in the performance of it. We know not well the way and manner of
   communication between angels and the spirits of just men made perfect.
   It is expressed in the Scripture by voices, postures, and gestures;
   which, although they are not of the same nature as absolutely ours are,
   yet are they really significant of the things they would express, and a
   means of mutual communication. Yea, I know not how far God may give
   them the use of voice and words through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> to express his praise, as Moses
   talked with Christ at his transfiguration, <reference osisRef="Matt.17.3">Matthew 17:3</reference> But the
   manner of it is such as through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> the whole assembly above do jointly set
   forth and celebrate the praises of God and the glory of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> consists<note n="consisteth">Auto-modernized</note>
   in three things.
				</p><p>
   [1.] The blessed and beautiful order of all things in that sanctuary.
   Job describes the grave beneath to be a "place without any order, and
   where the light is as darkness," <reference osisRef="Job.10.22">Job 10:22</reference> All above is order and
   light, -- every person and thing in its proper place and exercise.
   1^st, Heaven itself is a temple, a sanctuary, made so by the special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note>
   presence of God, and the ministration of Christ in the tabernacle of
   his human nature. 2^dly, God is on the throne of grace, gloriously
   exalted on the account of his grace, and for the dispensation of it. To
   the saints above he is on the throne of grace, in that they are in the
   full enjoyment of the effects of his grace, and do give glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   on the account of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note>. He is so, also with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church
   here below, in the continual communications of grace and mercy through
   Christ. 3^dly, The Lord Christ, in his human nature, is before the
   throne, acting his mediatory office and power in behalf of the church.
   4^thly, All the holy angels, in the various orders and degrees of their
   ministration, are about the throne continually. So -- 5^thly, Are the
   spirits of just men made perfect, in the various measures of light and
   glory. And these things were obscurely represented in the order of the
   church at its first erection in the wilderness; for the ordinances of
   God among them were patterns or figures of heavenly things, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.23">Hebrews 9:23</reference> (1^st,) In the midst was the tabernacle or sanctuary, -- which
   represented the sanctuary or temple above. (2^dly,) In the most holy
   place were the ark and mercy-seat, -- representatives of the throne of
   grace. (3^dly,) The ministry of the high priest, -- a type of the
   ministry of Christ. (4^thly,) The Levites, who attended on the priest,
   did represent the ministry of angels attending on Christ in the charge
   of his office. And, (5^thly,) Round about them were the tribes in their
   order.
				</p><p>
   [2.] In the full, clear apprehensions which all the blessed ones have
   of the glory of God in Christ, of the work and effects of his wisdom
   and grace towards mankind. These are the foundation of all divine
   worship. And because our conceptions and apprehensions about them are
   dark, low, obscure, and inevident, our worship is weak and imperfect
   also. But all is open to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints above. We are in the dust, the
   blood, the noise of the battle; they are victoriously at peace, and
   have a perfect view of what they have passed through, and what they
   have attained to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. They are come to the springs of life and light, and
   are filled with admiration of the grace of God in themselves and one
   another. What they see in God and in Jesus Christ, what they have
   experience of in themselves; what they know and learn from others, are
   all of them inconceivable and inexpressible. It is well for us, if we
   have so much experience of these things as to see a real glory in the
   fulness and perfection of them. The apprehensions by sight, without
   mixture of unsteadiness or darkness, without the alloy of fears or
   temptations, with an ineffable sense of the things themselves on their
   hearts or minds, are the springs or motives of the holy worship which
   is in heaven.
				</p><p>
   [3.] In the glorious manner of the performance of it. Now, whereas it
   arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note> from sight and present enjoyment, it must consist in a
   continual ascription of glory and praise to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God; and so it is
   described in the Scripture. See <reference osisRef="Rev.4.9 Rev.4.10 Rev.4.11">Revelation of John 4:9-11</reference>, with <reference osisRef="Isa.6.3">Isaiah 6:3</reference> And how
   little a portion of the glory of these things is it that we can
   apprehend!
				</p><p>
   3. In this solemn assembly before the throne of grace, the Lord Jesus
   Christ -- the great High Priest -- does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> represent and render acceptable
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God the worship of the church here below. So it is expressed, <reference osisRef="Rev.8.3 Rev.8.4">Revelation of John 8:3-4</reference>, "And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a
   golden censer; and there was given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him much incense, that he
   should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar
   which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense which came
   with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the
   angel's hand." It is a representation of the high priest burning
   incense on the golden altar on the day of atonement, when he entered
   into the most holy place; for that altar was placed just at the
   entrance of it, directly before the ark and mercy seat, representing
   the throne of God. This angel, therefore, is our High Priest; none else
   could approach that altar, or offer incense on it, the smoke of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note>
   was to enter into the holy place. And the "prayers of all saints" is a
   synecdochical expression of the whole worship of the church. And this
   is presented before the throne of God by this High Priest. And it is
   not said that their prayers came to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the throne of God, but the smoke
   of the incense out of the hand of the angel did so; for it is the
   incense of the intercession of Christ alone that gives them their
   acceptance with God. Without this, none of our prayers, praises, or
   thanksgivings, would ever have access into the presence of God, or to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   the throne of grace. Blessed be God for this relief, under the
   consideration of the weakness and imperfection of them! Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, in
   him and by him alone do we represent all our desires, and prayers, and
   whole worship to God. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, in all our worship, do we ourselves
   "enter into the most holy place," <reference osisRef="Heb.10.19">Hebrews 10:19</reference> We do it not merely by
   faith, but by this special<note n="especial">Auto-modernized</note> exercise of it, in putting our prayers into
   the hand of this High Priest.
				</p><p>
   There are three things in all our worship that would hinder its access
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and acceptance with him, as also keep off comfort and peace
   from our consciences. The first is, The sin or iniquity that cleaves
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it; secondly, The weakness or imperfection that at best is in it;
   and, thirdly, The unworthiness of the persons by whom it is performed.
   With reference to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these things the Law could never consummate or
   perfect the consciences of them that came to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by the sacrifices of
   it. But there are three things in the sacerdotal ministration of Christ
   that remove and take them all away, whereon we have access with
   boldness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God. And they are -- (1.) The influence of his oblation;
   (2.) The efficacy of his intercession; and, (3.) The dignity of his
   person. Through the first of these he bears and takes away all the
   iniquity of our holy things, as Aaron did typically of old, by virtue
   of the plate of gold with the name of God (a figure of Christ) on his
   forehead, <reference osisRef="Exod.28.36 Exod.28.37 Exod.28.38">Exodus 28:36-38</reference> He has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made atonement for them in the
   blood of his oblation, and they appear not in the presence of God.
   Through the second, or the efficacy of his intercession, he gives
   acceptance to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our prayers and holy worship, with power and prevalence
   before God. For this is that incense whose smoke or sweet perfume comes
   up with the prayers of all saints to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the throne of God. Through the
   third, or the dignity of his person, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he appears as the
   representative of his whole mystical body, he takes away from our
   consciences that sense of our own vileness and unworthiness which would
   not suffer us to approach with boldness to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the throne of grace. In
   these things consists the life of the worship of the church, -- of all
   believers; without which, as it would not be acceptable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, so we
   could have neither peace nor consolation in it ourselves.
				</p><p>
   4. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the church that is triumphant communion with that which
   is yet militant. The assembly above have not lost their concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in
   the church here below. As we rejoice in their glory, safety, and
   happiness, that having passed through the storms and tempests, the
   temptations, sufferings, and dangers, of this life and world, they are
   harboured in eternal glory, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the praise of God in Christ; so are
   they full of affections towards their brethren exercised with the same
   temptations, difficulties, and dangers, which they have passed through,
   with earnest desires for their deliverance and safety. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, when
   they behold the Lord Jesus Christ, as the great high priest over the
   house of God, presenting their prayers, with all their holy worship
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, rendering them acceptable by the incense of his own
   intercession, it fills them with satisfaction, and continually excites
   them to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the assignation of praise, and glory, and honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him.
   This is the state of the saints above, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church
   here below. This is all which may be in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> ascribed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them; and
   this may safely be so. What some have fancied about their own personal
   intercession, and that for particular persons, is derogatory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   honour of Jesus Christ, and inconsistent with their present condition;
   but in these things consists their communion with the church here
   below. A love they have to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it, from their union with it in the same
   mystical body, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference> A sense they have of its condition, from the
   experience they had of it in the days of their flesh. A great
   concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> they have for the glory of God in them, and a fervent
   desire of their eternal salvation. They know that without them they
   shall not be absolutely consummate, or made perfect in their whole
   persons, <reference osisRef="Rev.6.11">Revelation of John 6:11</reference> In this state of things they continually behold
   the Lord Jesus Christ presenting their prayers before the throne of
   grace, -- making intercession for them, -- appearing to plead their
   cause against all their adversaries, -- transacting all their affairs
   in the presence of God, -- taking care of their salvation, that not one
   of them shall perish. This continually fills them with a holy
   satisfaction and complacency, and is a great part of the subject-matter
   of their incessant praises and ascriptions of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   lies the concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of the church above in that here below; this is
   the communion that is between them, of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> the person of Christ, in
   the discharge of his office, is the bond and centre.
				</p><p>
   5. There is in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> a full manifestation made of the wisdom of God, in
   all the holy institutions of the tabernacle and temple of old. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   the veil is fully taken off from them, and that obscure representation
   of heavenly things is brought forth to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> light and glory. It is true,
   this is done to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a great degree in the dispensation of the Gospel. By
   the coming of Christ in the flesh, and the discharge of his mediatory
   office in this world, the substance of what they did prefigure is
   accomplished; and in the revelations of the Gospel the nature and end
   of them is declared. Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note>, they extended their signification also
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> things within the veil, or the discharge of the priestly office of
   Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.24">Hebrews 9:24</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as we have
   not yet a perfection of light to understand the depth of the mysteries
   contained in them; so themselves also were not absolutely fulfilled
   until the Lord Christ discharged his office in the holy place. This is
   the glory of the pattern which God showed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Moses in the mount, made
   conspicuous and evident to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all. In that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> especially do the saints of
   the Old Testament, who were exercised all their days in those typical
   institutions whose end and design they could not comprehend, see the
   manifold wisdom and goodness of God in them all, rejoicing in them for
   evermore.
				</p><p>
   6. All that the Lord Christ receives of the Father on the account of
   this holy interposition and mediation for the church, he is endowed
   with sovereign authority and almighty power in himself to execute and
   accomplish. Therefore is he said, as a priest, is be "made higher than
   the heavens;" and as a "priest to sit down at the right hand of the
   majesty on high," <reference osisRef="Heb.8.1">Hebrews 8:1</reference> This glorious power does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not
   immediately belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Him on the account of his sacerdotal office,
   but it is that qualification of his person which is necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   effectual discharge of it. Hence it is said of him, that he should
   "bear the glory," and "sit and rule upon his throne," and should be "a
   priest upon his throne," <reference osisRef="Zech.6.13">Zechariah 6:13</reference> A throne is insigne regium , and
   properly belongs to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his kingly office, <reference osisRef="Heb.1.8 Heb.1.9">Hebrews 1:8-9</reference> Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> the power accompanying and belonging to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his throne
   being necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the effectual discharge of his priestly office, as
   he sits and rules on his throne, so it is said that he is a "priest on
   his throne" also.
				</p><p>
   This is one instance of the present state of Christ in heaven, and of
   the work which he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> there perform, and the only instance I shall
   insist upon. He was made a priest "after the power of an endless life,"
   -- the life which he now leads in heaven; -- and "lives for ever to
   make intercession for us." He was dead, but is alive, and lives for
   evermore, and has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> the keys of hell and death, -- all power over the
   enemies of his church. God on a throne of grace; -- Christ, the high
   priest, so on his right hand in glory and power as yet to be "before
   the throne" in the virtue of his sacerdotal office, with the whole
   concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> of the church on his hand, transacting all things with God
   for them; -- all the holy angels and the "spirits of just men made
   perfect" encompassing the throne with continual praises to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, even
   the Father, and him, on the account of the work of infinite wisdom,
   goodness, and grace, in his incarnation, mediation, and salvation of
   the church thereby; -- himself continuing to manage the cause of the
   whole church before God, presenting all their prayers and services to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   him perfumed with his own intercession, -- is that resemblance of
   heaven and its present glory which the Scripture offers to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us. But,
   alas! how weak, how dark, how low, are our conceptions and
   apprehensions of these heavenly things! We see yet as through a glass
   darkly, and know but in part. The time is approaching when we shall see
   these things "with open face," and know even as we are known. The best
   improvement we can make of this prospect, whilst faith supplies the
   place of future sight, is to be stirred up thereby to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> holy longings
   after a participation in this glory, and constant diligence in that
   holy obedience through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> we may arrive to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>.
				</p><p>
   What remains<note n="remaineth">Auto-modernized</note> yet to be spoken on this subject has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these
   two ensuing propositions: 
				</p><p>
   1. All the effects of the offices of Christ, internal, spiritual, and
   eternal, in grace and glory, -- all external fruits of their
   dispensation in providence towards the church or its enemies, -- are
   wrought by divine power; or are the effects of an emanation of power
   from God. They are all wrought "by the exceeding greatness of his
   power," even as he wrought in Christ himself when he raised him from
   the dead, <reference osisRef="Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:19</reference> For all the outward works of God, such as all
   these are, which are wrought in and for the church, are necessarily
   immediate effects of divine power, -- nor can be of another nature.
				</p><p>
   2. Upon supposition of the obedience of Christ in this life, and the
   atonement made by his blood for sin, with his exaltation upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, there
   is nothing in any essential property of the nature of God, -- nothing
   in the eternal, unchangeable law of obedience, -- to hinder but that
   God might work all these things in us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his own honour and glory, in
   the eternal salvation of the church and the destruction of all its
   enemies, without a continuance of the administration of the offices of
   Christ in heaven, and all that sacred solemnity of worship with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> it
   is accompanied.
				</p><p>
   These things being certain and evident, we may inquire upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note>, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note>
   it is that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> ordered the continuation of all these things in
   heaven above, seeing these ends might have been accomplished without
   them, by immediate acts of divine power.
				</p><p>
   The great "works of the Lord are sought out of them that have pleasure
   in them," <reference osisRef="Ps.111.2">Psalms 111:2</reference> This, therefore, being a great work of God, which
   he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> wrought and revealed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us, especially in the effect and
   fruit of it, and that for the manifestation of his wisdom and grace, it
   is our duty to inquire into it with all humble diligence; "for those
   things which are revealed belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us and our children," that we may
   do the will of God for our good. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, --
				</p><p>
   (1.) God would have it so, for the manifestation of his own glory. This
   is the first great end of all the works of God. That it is so is a
   fundamental principle of our religion. And how his works do glorify him
   is our duty to inquire. The essential glory of God is always the same,
   -- eternal and immutable. It is the being of God, with that respect
   which all creatures have to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. For glory adds a supposition of
   relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> being. But the manifestations of his glory are various,
   according to the pleasure of his will. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, that which he
   chooses<note n="chooseth">Auto-modernized</note> to manifest his glory in and by at one time, he may cease from
   using it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end at another; for its being a means of the
   manifestation of his glory may depend on such circumstances, such a
   state of things, which being removed, it ceases<note n="ceaseth">Auto-modernized</note> to be. So of old he
   manifested and represented his glory in the tabernacle and temple, and
   the holy pledges of his presence in them, and was glorified in all the
   worship of the Law. But now he ceases<note n="ceaseth">Auto-modernized</note> so to do, nor is any more
   honoured by the services and ceremonies of religion in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> prescribed.
   If the whole structure of the temple and all its beautiful services
   were now in being on the earth, no glory would redound to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God
   thereby, -- he would receive none from it. To expect the glory of God
   in them would be a high dishonour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him. And God may at any time
   begin to manifest his glory by such ways and means as he did not
   formerly make use of to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that purpose. So is it with all Gospel
   ordinances: which state will be continued to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consummation of all
   things here below, and no longer; for then shall they all cease, -- God
   will be no more glorified in them or by them. So has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> God chosen to
   glorify himself in heaven by this administration of all things in and
   by Jesus Christ; to which<note n="whereunto">Auto-modernized</note> also there is an end determined.
				</p><p>
   And in the continuance of this holy worship in the sanctuary above, God
   does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> manifest his glory on many accounts, and rests<note n="resteth">Auto-modernized</note> thereto. First,
   he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> it in and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the saints who departed this life under the Old
   Testament. They came short in glory of what they now enter into who die
   in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. For -- not to dispute about nor
   determine positively, what was their state and condition before the
   ascension of Christ into heaven, or what was the nature of the blessed
   receptacle of their souls -- it is manifest that they did not, they
   could not, behold the glory of God, and the accomplishment of the
   mystery of his wisdom and will, in Jesus Christ; nor was it perfectly
   made known to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. Whatever were their rest, refreshment, and
   blessedness, -- whatever were their enjoyments of the presence of God;
   yet was there no throne of grace erected in heaven, -- no High Priest
   appearing before it, -- no Lamb as it had been slain, -- no joint
   ascription of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that sits on the throne, and the Lamb, for
   ever; God "having provided some better thing for us, that they without
   us should not be made perfect." See <reference osisRef="Eph.3.9 Eph.3.10">Ephesians 3:9-10</reference>
				</p><p>
   This was that, and this was that alone, so far as in the Scripture it
   is revealed, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they came short of that glory which is now enjoyed
   in heaven. And in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> consists the advantage of the saints above them,
   who now die in faith. Their state in heaven was suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their faith
   and worship on the earth. They had no clear, distinct knowledge of the
   incarnation and mediatory office of Christ by their revelations and
   services; only they believed that the promise of deliverance, of grace
   and mercy, should be in and by him accomplished. Their reception into
   heaven -- that which they were made meet and prepared for by their
   faith and worship -- was suited to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note>. They had a blessed rest and
   happiness, above what we can comprehend; for who knows what it is to be
   in the glorious presence of God, though at the greatest distance? They
   were not immediately surprised with an appearance of that glory which
   they had no distinct apprehensions of in this world. Neither they nor
   the angels knew clearly either the sufferings of Christ or the glory
   that should ensue. But they saw and knew that there was yet something
   farther to be done in heaven and earth, as yet hid in God and the
   counsels of his will, for the exaltation of his glory in the complete
   salvation of the church. This they continued waiting for in the holy
   place of their refreshment above. Faith gave them, and it gives us, an
   entrance into the presence of God, and makes us meet for it. But what
   they immediately enjoyed did not in its whole kind exceed what their
   faith directed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. No more does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> ours. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> they were not
   prepared for a view of the present glory of heaven; nor did enjoy it.
   But the saints under the New Testament, who are clearly instructed by
   the Gospel in the mysteries of the incarnation and mediation of Christ,
   are, by their faith and worship, made meet for an immediate entrance
   into this glory. This they long for, this they expect and are secured
   of, from the prayer of our Saviour, -- that they be, when they leave
   this world, where he is, to behold his glory.
				</p><p>
   But now, upon the entrance of Christ into the heavenly sanctuary, all
   those holy ones were admitted into the same glory with what the saints
   under the New Testament do enjoy. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> with open face they behold the
   use and end of those typical services and ordinances in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> these
   things were shadowed out to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. No heart can conceive that
   ineffable addition of glory which they received hereby. The mystery of
   the wisdom and grace of God in their redemption and salvation by Christ
   was now fully represented to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them; what they had prayed for, longed
   for, and desired to see in the days of their flesh on the earth, and
   waited for so long in heaven, was now gloriously made manifest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   them. Upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> did glorious light and blessed satisfaction come into and
   upon all those blessed souls, who died in the faith, but had not
   received the promise, -- only beheld it afar off. And hereby did God
   greatly manifest his own glory in them and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them; which is the
   first end of the continuation of this state of things in heaven. This
   makes me judge that the season of Christ's entrance into heaven, as the
   holy sanctuary of God, was the greatest instance of created glory that
   ever was or ever shall be, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the consummation of all things. And
   this as for other reasons, so because all the holy souls who had
   departed in the faith from the foundation of the world, were then
   received into the glorious light of the counsels of God, and knowledge
   of the effects of his grace by Jesus Christ.
				</p><p>
   Want of a due apprehension of the truth in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> caused many,
   especially those of the Church of Rome, to follow after vain
   imaginations about the state of the souls of the faithful, departed
   under the Old Testament. Generally, they shut them up in a subterranean
   limbus, from where<note n="whence">Auto-modernized</note> they were delivered by the descent of Christ. But it is
   contrary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all notions and revelations of the respect of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   his people -- contrary to the life and nature of faith -- that those
   who have passed through their course of obedience in this world, and
   finished the work given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, should not enter, upon their
   departure, into blessed rest in the presence of God. Take away the
   persuasion of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note>, and the whole nature of faith is destroyed. But into
   the fulness of present glory they could not be admitted; as has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> been
   declared.
				</p><p>
   Moreover, God hereby manifests his glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the holy angels
   themselves. Those things in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> it does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> consist were hid in himself
   even from them, from the foundation of the world, -- hidden in the holy
   counsels of his will, <reference osisRef="Eph.3.9">Ephesians 3:9</reference> Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these "principalities
   and powers in heavenly places the manifold wisdom of God was made known
   by the church," verse 10. The church being redeemed by the blood of
   Christ, and himself upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> exalted in this glory, they came to know
   the "manifold wisdom of God" by the effects of it; which before they
   earnestly desired to look into, <reference osisRef="1Pet.1.12">1 Peter 1:12</reference> Hereby is all the glory
   of the counsels of God in Christ made conspicuous to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them; and they
   receive themselves no small advancement in glory thereby. For in the
   present comprehension of the mind of God, and doing of his will, does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note>
   their blessedness consist.
				</p><p>
   Heaven itself was not what it is, before the entrance of Christ into
   the sanctuary for the administration of his office. Neither the saints
   departed nor the angels themselves were participant of that glory which
   now they are. Neither yet does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> this argue any defect in heaven, or the
   state of that<note n="thereof">Auto-modernized</note> in its primitive constitution; for the perfection of any
   state has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that order of things which it is originally
   suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>. Take all things in the order of the first creation, and
   with respect to that<note n="thereunto">Auto-modernized</note> heaven was perfect in glory from the beginning.
   Nevertheless<note n="howbeit">Auto-modernized</note> there was still a relation and regard in it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church of
   mankind on the earth, which was to be translated thither. But by the
   entrance of sin all this order was disturbed, and all this relation was
   broken. And there followed upon that<note n="thereon">Auto-modernized</note> an imperfection in the state of
   heaven itself; for it had no longer a relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, or communion with,
   them on earth, nor was a receptacle meet for men who were sinners to be
   received into. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, by the "blood of the cross," God "reconciled
   all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> himself, whether they be things in earth, or things in
   heaven," <reference osisRef="Col.1.20">Colossians 1:20</reference>, -- or gathered all things into one in him, "both
   which are in heaven, and which are on earth," <reference osisRef="Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</reference> Even the
   things in heaven so far stood in need of a reconciliation, as that they
   might be gathered together in one with the things on earth; the glory
   of which<note n="whereof">Auto-modernized</note> is manifested in this heavenly ministration. And the apostle
   affirms that the "heavenly things themselves" were purified by the
   sacrifice of Christ, <reference osisRef="Heb.9.23">Hebrews 9:23</reference> Not that they were actually defiled
   in themselves, but without this purification they were not meet for the
   fellowship of this mystery in the joint worship of the whole society in
   heaven and earth, by Jesus Christ. Hence, therefore, there is a
   continual manifestation of the glory of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the angels themselves.
   They behold his manifold wisdom and grace in the blessed effects of it,
   which were treasured up in the holy counsels of his will from eternity.
   Hereby is their own light and blessedness advanced, and they are filled
   with admiration of God, ascribing praise, honour, and glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him
   for evermore; for the beholding of the mystery of the wisdom of God in
   Christ, which is here so despised in the dispensation of the Gospel, is
   the principal part of the blessedness of the angels in heaven, which
   fills them with eternal delight, and is the ground of their ascribing
   praise and glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for evermore.
				</p><p>
   This is that manifestative glory with which<note n="wherewith">Auto-modernized</note> God satisfies<note n="satisfieth">Auto-modernized</note> himself,
   until the end determined shall be. On the account of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> he does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> and
   will bear with things in this world, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the appointed season. For
   whilst the creation is in its present posture, a revenue of glory must
   be taken out of it for God; and longer than that is done it cannot be
   continued. But the world is so full of darkness and confusion, of sin
   and wickedness, of enmity against God, -- is so given up to villany,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the ways through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> God may be dishonoured, -- that there is
   little or no appearance of any revenue of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him from it. Were
   it not on the secret account of divine wisdom, it would quickly receive
   the end of Sodom and Gomorrah. The small remnant of the inheritance of
   Christ is shut up in such obscurity, that, as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> visible appearance
   and manifestation, it is no way to be laid in the balance against the
   dishonour that is done to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him by the whole world. But whilst things
   are in this posture here below, God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> a solemn honour, glory, and
   worship above, in the presence of all his holy ones; in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he rests<note n="resteth">Auto-modernized</note>
   and takes pleasure. In his satisfaction in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> he will continue things
   in this world to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all the ends of his wisdom, goodness, righteousness,
   and patience, let it rage in villainy and wickedness as it pleases<note n="pleaseth">Auto-modernized</note>.
   And so, when any of the saints who are wearied, and even worn out, with
   the state of things in this world, and, it may be, understand not the
   grounds of the patience of God, do enter into this state, they shall,
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their full satisfaction, behold that glory which abundantly
   compensates the present dishonour done to God here below.
				</p><p>
   (2.) This state of things is continued for the glory of Christ himself.
   The office of Mediator was committed by God the Father to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his
   only-begotten Son, -- no other being able to bear or discharge it. See
   <reference osisRef="Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rev.5.1 Rev.5.2 Rev.5.3 Rev.5.4 Rev.5.5">Revelation of John 5:1-5</reference> But in the discharge of this office it was
   necessary he should condescend to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a mean and low condition, and to
   undergo things difficult, hard, and terrible, <reference osisRef="Phil.2.6 Phil.2.7 Phil.2.8">Philippians 2:6-8</reference> Such were
   the things which our Lord Jesus Christ underwent in this world; -- his
   undergoing of them being necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the discharge of his office;
   yea, it consisted in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> was he exposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> reproach,
   contempt, and shame, with all the evils that Satan or the world could
   bring upon him. And besides, he was, for us and in our stead, to
   undergo the "curse of the law," with the greatest of terror and sorrows
   in his soul, until he gave up the ghost. These things were necessary
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the discharge of his office, nor could the salvation of the church
   be wrought out without them. But do we think that God would commit so
   glorious an office to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his only Son to be discharged in this manner
   only? Let it be granted that after he had so accomplished the will of
   God in this world, he had himself entered into glory; yet if he should
   so cease the administration of his office, that must be looked on as
   the most afflictive and dolorous that ever was undergone. But it was
   the design of God to glorify the office itself; as an effect of his
   wisdom, and himself in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; yea, so as that the very office itself
   should be an everlasting honour to his Son as incarnate. To<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this end
   the administration of it is continued in glory in his hand, and he is
   exalted in the discharge of it. For this is that glory which he prays
   that all his disciples may be brought to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him to behold. The time
   between his ascension and the end of all things is allotted to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   glory of Christ in the administration of his office in the heavenly
   sanctuary. And from hence does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> the apostle prove him, "as a high
   priest," to be far more glorious than those who were called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that
   office under the law, <reference osisRef="Heb.8.1 Heb.8.2 Heb.8.3">Hebrews 8:1-3</reference> In this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> it is manifest to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> angels
   and men, how glorious a thing it is to be the only king, priest, and
   prophet of the church. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, as it behoved Christ, in the
   discharge of his office, to suffer; so, after his sufferings in the
   discharge of the same office, he was to enter into his glory, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.18">Revelation of John 1:18</reference>
				</p><p>
   (3.) God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> respect in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> those who depart in the faith, in
   their respective generations, especially those who died betimes, as the
   apostles and primitive Christians. And sundry things may be in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>
   considered.
				</p><p>
   [1.] There are two things which believers put a great price and value
   on in this world, and which sweeten every condition to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them. Without
   them the world would be a noisome dungeon to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, nor could they be
   satisfied with a continuance in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. The one is the service of Christ.
   Without an opportunity of being exercised in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>, they could not abide
   here with any satisfaction. They who know it not so to be, are under
   the power of worldly-mindedness. The meanest service of Christ has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note>
   refreshment in it. And as to those who have opportunities and abilities
   for great instances of service, they do not know on just grounds, nor
   are able to determine themselves, whether it be best for them to
   continue in their service here below, or to enter into the immediate
   service of Christ above; -- so glorious, so excellent is it to be
   usefully serviceable to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lord Jesus. So was it with the apostle,
   <reference osisRef="Phil.1.21 Phil.1.22 Phil.1.23 Phil.1.24 Phil.1.25 Phil.1.26">Philippians 1:21-26</reference>; -- so may it be with others, if they serve him in the
   same spirit, with the same sincerity, though their ability in service
   be not like to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his. For neither had he anything but what he received.
   Again, they have the enjoyment of Christ in the ordinances of Gospel
   worship. By these means do they live, -- in these things is the life of
   their souls.
				</p><p>
   In this state of things God will not call them hence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> their loss;
   he will not put an end to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> these privileges, without an abundant
   recompense and advantage. Whatever we enjoy here, yet still to depart
   hence and to be with Christ shall be far better, <reference osisRef="Phil.1.23">Philippians 1:23</reference> For, --
				</p><p>
   1^st, although service here below shall cease, and be given over to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   other hands who are to have their share in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note>; yet, on the continuance
   of this state of things in heaven, there is also a continuation of
   service to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> Christ, in a way inexpressibly more glorious than what we
   are in this life capable of. Upon their admittance into this state of
   things above, they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and
   night in his temple; and he that sits<note n="sitteth">Auto-modernized</note> on the throne shall dwell
   among them, <reference osisRef="Rev.7.15">Revelation of John 7:15</reference> The whole state of the glorious worship of
   God before described is here respected; and in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> is a continual
   service performed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him that sits on the throne, and to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> it is so far from being loss, in being called off from
   service here below, as that, in point of service itself, it is an
   inconceivable advancement.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, The enjoyment of Christ in and by the ordinances of his worship,
   is the immediate fountain and spring of all our refreshments and
   consolations in this world, <reference osisRef="Ps.87.7">Psalms 87:7</reference>; but what is it to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the
   blessed immediate enjoyment of him in heaven! Hence the blessedness of
   the state above is described, by being with Christ, being with Christ
   for ever, -- in the presence and immediate enjoyment of him. The light
   of the stars is useful and relieving in a dark night as we are on our
   way; but what are they when the sun arises<note n="ariseth">Auto-modernized</note>! Will any man think it a
   loss that, upon the rising of the sun, they shall not enjoy their light
   any more, though in the night they knew not what to have done without
   it? It may be we cannot conceive how it will be best for us to forego
   the use of sacraments, ministry, and the Scripture itself. But all the
   virtue of the streams is in the fountain; and the immediate enjoyment
   of Christ unspeakably exceeds whatever by any means we can be made
   partakers of here below.
				</p><p>
   In this blessed state have the holy apostles, all the primitive martyrs
   and believers, from the time of their dissolution, enjoyed full
   satisfaction and solace, in the glorious assembly above, <reference osisRef="Rev.7.15 Rev.7.16 Rev.7.17">Revelation of John 7:15-17</reference>, etc..
				</p><p>
   [2.] Hereby there is a continuation of communion between the church
   triumphant above and that yet militant here below. That there is such a
   communion between glorified saints and believers in this world, is an
   article of faith. Both societies are but one church, one mystical body,
   have one Head, and a mutual concern<note n="concernment">Auto-modernized</note> in each other. Yea, the spring
   and means of this communion is no small part of the glory of the
   Gospel. For, -- before the saints under the Old Testament had the
   mystery of the glory of God in Christ, with our redemption thereby,
   revealed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them, in the way before declared, -- the communion was
   very obscure; but we are now taken into the light and glory of it, as
   the apostle declares, <reference osisRef="Heb.12.22 Heb.12.23 Heb.12.24">Hebrews 12:22-24</reference>
				</p><p>
   I know some have perverted the notions of the communion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> idolatrous
   superstition; and so have all other truths of the Gospel been abused
   and wrested, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the destruction of the souls of men; -- all the
   Scriptures have been so dealt withal, <reference osisRef="2Pet.3.16">2 Peter 3:16</reference> But they deceived
   themselves in this matter, -- the truth deceives<note n="deceiveth">Auto-modernized</note> none. Upon a
   supposition of communion, they gathered that there must of necessity be
   an immediate communication between them above and us below. And if so,
   they knew no way for it, no means of it, but by our praying to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them,
   and their praying for us. But they were under the power of their own
   deceivings. Communion does<note n="doth">Auto-modernized</note> not require immediate mutual communication,
   unless it be among persons in the same state, and that in such acts as
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> they are mutually assisting and helpful to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> one another. But
   our different states will admit of no such intercourse; nor do we stand
   in need of any relief from them, or can be helped by any acts of their
   love, as we may aid and help one another here below. Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note> the
   centre of this communion is in Christ alone and our exercise of it is
   upon him only, with respect to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> them.
				</p><p>
   Yet upon this<note n="hereon">Auto-modernized</note> some deny that there is any such communion between the
   members of the church or the mystical body of Christ in these diverse
   states. And they suppose it is so declared in that of the prophet, <reference osisRef="Isa.63.16">Isaiah 63:16</reference>, "Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant
   of us, and Israel acknowledge us not." But there is nothing of any such
   importance in these words. The church, under a deep sense of its
   present state, in its unworthy walking and multiplied provocations,
   profess themselves to be such, as that their forefathers in covenant
   could not own them as their children and posterity in the faith.
   Hereupon they appeal to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the infinite mercy and faithfulness of God,
   which extend themselves even to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that condition of unworthiness which
   was enough to render them utterly disowned by the best of men, however
   otherwise concerned in them. But to suppose the church above, which
   has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> passed through its course of faith and obedience in afflictions,
   tribulations, and persecutions, to be ignorant of the state of the
   church here below in general, and unconcerned in it, -- to be without
   desires of its success, deliverance, and prosperity, to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of
   Christ, -- is to lay them asleep in a senseless state, without the
   exercise of any grace, or any interest in the glory of God. And if they
   cry for vengeance on the obdurate persecuting world, <reference osisRef="Rev.6.10">Revelation of John 6:10</reference>, shall
   we suppose they have no consideration nor knowledge of the state of the
   church suffering the same things which they did themselves? And, to put
   it out of question, they are minded of it in the next verse by Christ
   himself, verse 11.
				</p><p>
   But that which at present I alone intend, is the joint communion of the
   whole church in the worship of God in Christ. Were all that die in the
   Lord immediately received into that state in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> God "shall be all in
   all," -- without any use of the mediation of Christ, or the worship of
   praise and honour given to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God by him, -- without being exercised in
   the ascription of honour, glory, power, and dominion to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, on the
   account of the past and present discharge of his office, -- there could
   be no communion between them and us. But whilst they are in the
   sanctuary, in the temple of God, in the holy worship of Christ and of
   God in him, and we are not only employed in the same work, in sacred
   ordinances suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our state and condition, but, in the performance
   of our duties, do by faith "enter in within the veil," and approach
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the same throne of grace in the most holy place, there is a
   spiritual communion between them and us. So the apostle expresses<note n="expresseth">Auto-modernized</note> it,
   <reference osisRef="Heb.12.22 Heb.12.23 Heb.12.24">Hebrews 12:22-24</reference>

   [3.] It is the way that God has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> appointed to prepare the holy souls
   above for the enjoyment of that eternal state which shall ensue at the
   end of all things. As we are here, in and by the Word and other
   ordinances, prepared and made meet for the present state of things in
   glory; so are they, by the temple-worship of heaven, fitted for that
   state of things when Christ shall give up the kingdom to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father,
   that God may be all in all.
				</p><p>
   (4.) Respect is had in this<note n="herein">Auto-modernized</note> to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the faith of the church yet militant on
   the earth, and that, among others, in two things.
				</p><p>
   1^st, For the encouragement of their faith. God could, as we have
   observed, upon the supposition of the atonement and reconciliation made
   by the blood of Christ, have saved the church by mere sovereign act of
   power. But whereas it was to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his glory that we should be saved in the
   way of faith and obedience, this way was necessary to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our
   encouragement in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. For it is in the nature of faith, it is a grace
   suited to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> that end, to seek for and receive aid, help, and relief,
   from God continually, to enable us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> obedience.
				</p><p>
   For this end the Lord Christ continues<note n="continueth">Auto-modernized</note> in the discharge of his office,
   through which<note n="whereby">Auto-modernized</note> he is able to save us to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the uttermost, that we may receive
   such supplies by and from him. The continual use that faith makes of
   Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> this purpose, as he gloriously exercises<note n="exerciseth">Auto-modernized</note> his mediatory
   office and power in heaven, cannot fully be declared. Neither can any
   believer, who is acted by present Gospel light and grace, conceive how
   the life of faith can be led or preserved without it. No duties are we
   called to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>, -- no temptation are we exercised withal, -- no sufferings
   do we undergo, -- no difficulties, dangers, fears, have we to conflict
   withal, -- nothing is there in life or death, in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> the glory of God
   or our own spiritual welfare is concerned, -- but faith finds and takes
   relief and encouragement in the present mediatory life and power of
   Christ in heaven, with the exercise of his love, care, and compassion
   in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. So he proposes<note n="proposeth">Auto-modernized</note> himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> our faith, <reference osisRef="Rev.1.17 Rev.1.18">Revelation of John 1:17-18</reference>
				</p><p>
   2^dly, That our faith may be guided and directed in all our accesses
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God in his holy worship. Were nothing proposed to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us but the
   immensity of the divine essence, we should not know how to make our
   approaches to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> it. And thence it is that those who are unacquainted
   with the glory of this dispensation, who know not how to make use of
   Christ in his present state for an access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, are always
   inventing ways of their own (as by saints, angels, images) for that
   end; for an immediate access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the divine essence they cannot fancy.
   Therefore<note n="wherefore">Auto-modernized</note>, to end this discourse in one word, -- all the present faith
   and worship of God in the church here on earth, all access to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him for
   grace, and all acceptable ascriptions of glory to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his divine majesty,
   do all of them, in their being and exercise, wholly depend on, and are
   resolved into, the continuation of the mediatory actings of Christ in
   heaven and glory.
				</p><p>
   I shall close this discourse with a little review of somewhat that
   passed before. From the consideration of that place of the apostle
   in which<note n="wherein">Auto-modernized</note> he affirms, that at the end Christ shall give up the kingdom
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the Father, I declared that all the state of things which we have
   described shall then cease, and all things issue in the immediate
   enjoyments of God himself. I would extend this no farther than as to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   what concerns<note n="concerneth">Auto-modernized</note> the exercise of Christ's mediatory office with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the church here below, and the enemies of it. But there are some
   things which belong to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the essence of this state which shall continue
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> all eternity; as, --
				</p><p>
   1^st, I do believe that the person of Christ, in and by his human
   nature, shall be for ever the immediate head of the whole glorified
   creation. God having gathered all things to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> a head in him, the knot
   or centre of that collection shall never be dissolved. We shall never
   lose our relation to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> him, nor he his to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> us.
				</p><p>
   2^dly, I do therefore also believe, that he shall be the means and way
   of communication between God and his glorified saints for ever. What
   are, what will be, the glorious communications of God to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his saints
   for ever, in life, light, power, joy, rest, and ineffable satisfaction,
   (as all must be from him to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> eternity,) I shall not now inquire. But
   this I say, they shall be all made in and through the person of the
   Son, and the human nature in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>. That tabernacle shall never be
   folded up, never be laid aside as useless. And if it be said, that I
   cannot declare the way and manner of the eternal communications of God
   himself to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> his saints in glory by Christ; I shall only say, that I
   cannot declare the way and manner of his communications of himself in
   grace by Christ to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the souls of men in this world, and yet I do
   believe it. How much more must we satisfy ourselves with the evidence
   of faith alone in those things which, as yet, are more
   incomprehensible. And our adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, by love and delight,
   shall always be through Christ. For God will be conceived of to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   eternity according to the manifestation that he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> made of himself in
   him, and no otherwise. This shall not be by acting faith with respect
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> the actual exercise of the mediation of Christ, as now we cleave
   to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God; but it shall be by the all-satisfying acting of love to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note>
   God, as he has<note n="hath">Auto-modernized</note> manifested himself, and will manifest himself in
   Christ.
				</p><p>
   3^dly, The person of Christ, and in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note> his human nature, shall be the
   eternal object of divine glory, praise, and worship. The life of glory
   is not a mere state of contemplation. Vision is the principle of it, as
   faith is of the life of grace. Love is the great vital acting of that
   principle, in adherence to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God with eternal delight. But this is
   active in it also. It shall be exercised in the continual ascription
   and assignation of glory, praise, and honour to<note n="unto">Auto-modernized</note> God, and the glorious
   exercise of all sorts of grace in that<note n="therein">Auto-modernized</note>; -- of this<note n="hereof">Auto-modernized</note> the Lamb, the person
   of Christ, is the eternal object with that of the Father and the
   Spirit; the human nature in the Son, admitted into the communion of the
   same eternal glory.
